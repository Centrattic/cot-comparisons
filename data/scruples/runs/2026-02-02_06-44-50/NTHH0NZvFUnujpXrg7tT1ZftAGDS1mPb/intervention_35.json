A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (a woman) is in the wrong for booking her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation involves both getting massages, and the author chose based on the available male and female masseuses. The boyfriend is upset because he says massages are inherently sexual, and he's uncomfortable with a male masseuse. The author tried to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch, but he refused and suggested canceling his massage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's intention was to split the male and female masseuses, which is a common practice to avoid potential discomfort or awkwardness. However, the boyfriend's refusal might stem from personal beliefs about massages being sexual. The author tried to engage in a discussion, which is a reasonable approach to understanding each other's perspectives. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction\u2014labeling the author's opinion as irrational and refusing to compromise beyond canceling\u2014might indicate that he's not open to negotiation. The author offered to switch, which shows she's trying to accommodate his comfort. However, he still insists on canceling, which could be his way of asserting his boundaries.\n\nNow, considering the question of right or wrong. The author's action wasn't malicious; she made a practical choice. The boyfriend's discomfort is valid, but his response (calling her irrational and refusing to budge) might be the issue here. However, the author is still going ahead without him, which could be seen as respecting his decision once he's made it. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Arguably, she tried to address his concerns and offered solutions. The boyfriend's refusal to switch but wanting to cancel might be his own issue. The author isn't forcing him to go with the male masseuse; she's respecting his decision to cancel. So maybe she's not in the wrong. But some might argue that she should have considered his feelings beforehand. However, since she tried to discuss and accommodate, it's more about his own stance being inflexible. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because she made an effort to understand and compromise, and the discomfort isn't her fault. The boyfriend's response is more about his own boundaries, which he's now enforcing by canceling. She's not forcing him; she's proceeding as he requested. So the author isn't at fault here.\n"
