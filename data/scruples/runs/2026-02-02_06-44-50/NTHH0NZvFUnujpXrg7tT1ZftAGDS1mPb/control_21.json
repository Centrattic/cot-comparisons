A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation is about scheduling massages with their boyfriend. The author, who is female, booked the boyfriend with a male masseuse and herself with a female. The boyfriend then says he's uncomfortable with a male masseuse because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author tried to discuss it but he shut the conversation down, saying her opinion was irrational and offered to cancel his massage. She's going ahead without him.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the main points. The author's action was making a choice that the boyfriend later found uncomfortable. She had the option to switch masseuses and even offered to, but he refused. The key issue is about respecting boundaries and autonomy.\n\nThe boyfriend's discomfort is based on his belief that massages are sexual. While the author views them as therapeutic, his perspective is valid for him. The author tried to understand, but when he was resistant, she persisted. Even though she offered to switch, he found it too much and canceled. The question is whether her initial decision was wrong.\n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is crucial. The author made a choice without considering her boyfriend's potential discomfort. Even though she offered to switch, the fact that he had to cancel might indicate that her initial decision was overstepping. However, she didn't know his feelings beforehand. But once she knew, she tried to accommodate. Still, he chose not to proceed. \n\nIs the author at fault? Maybe not entirely, but she could have communicated better beforehand. However, since she did offer to switch, perhaps she's not in the wrong. Alternatively, the boyfriend has the right to his boundaries, and the author might not be wrong for trying to accommodate, even if he ended up canceling. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether making a choice without prior discussion is wrong. Since they were going together, the author might have assumed shared preferences. But the boyfriend's reaction suggests he had reservations. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because she acted in good faith and tried to adjust. The boyfriend's refusal is his own choice. So, answer B: No.\n"
