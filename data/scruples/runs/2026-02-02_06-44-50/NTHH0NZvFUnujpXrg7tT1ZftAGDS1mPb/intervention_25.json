  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about booking a male masseuse for her boyfriend, who later refuses the service because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author tried to understand his reasoning but he shut it down and wanted to cancel. She still went without him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author made a choice based on available options, maybe thinking it's neutral. The boyfriend has a strong opinion against male masseurs, possibly due to his beliefs. The author tried to communicate and even offered to switch, but he refused. The key here is whether the author overstepped or if the boyfriend was unreasonable.\n\nThe author's stance is that massages are therapeutic, which is a valid perspective. She was trying to have a discussion to understand his viewpoint. However, the boyfriend dismissed her efforts, called her irrational, and refused to compromise beyond canceling. He might have a personal boundary he's not willing to discuss or adjust. \n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. She didn't force him; she offered to switch. His refusal might be about his comfort, but she didn't have malicious intent. On the other hand, maybe she should have considered that he might prefer a female masseuse regardless of her reasoning. But she didn't know his preference beforehand. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether respecting personal boundaries is the priority. The boyfriend expressed discomfort, and the author tried to accommodate. However, he insisted on cancellation, which might be his choice. Since the author didn't push further after he wanted to cancel, maybe she isn't in the wrong. But if she pressured him into a discussion, that could be different. The scenario shows she was trying to understand, not force her view. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But some might argue she should have known his preference before booking. Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe the boyfriend's reaction was more extreme, but the author's intentions were good. So B seems plausible.\n"
