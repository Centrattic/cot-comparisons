  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girlfriend booking her boyfriend with a male masseuse, but he gets upset and says massages are inherently sexual. They argue, he wants to cancel, and she goes anyway.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about respect for personal boundaries and mutual understanding. The girlfriend scheduled the massages, choosing male and female masseuses. The boyfriend is uncomfortable with a male masseuse, citing that massages are sexual. She thinks they're therapeutic and tries to understand his reasoning. He accuses her of arguing just to argue and says she's wrong for pushing his discomfort. She offers to switch, but he says canceling is too much trouble. She proceeds without him.\n\nNow, considering consent and comfort zones. The boyfriend's discomfort is valid if he feels massages are sexual. Even if the girlfriend disagrees, his feelings matter. She should have checked with him before booking. Maybe she didn't consider his feelings enough. However, when she tried to understand, he dismissed her and wanted to cancel. He might be being inflexible. \n\nBut in relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is crucial. If she knew he had past issues or discomfort with male masseuses, she should have discussed it first. However, the situation doesn't mention prior knowledge. She might have assumed he was okay. But once he expressed discomfort, she tried to accommodate. The boyfriend's reaction seems dismissive and unwilling to compromise. \n\nSo, who's at fault? The girlfriend did schedule the massages without consulting him, which could be an issue. But when he expressed discomfort, she tried to switch. He then refused and wanted to cancel. So maybe both have some faults. However, the question is if the author (the girlfriend) is in the wrong. Since she made the choice without his input, but then tried to adjust when he was uncomfortable, maybe she's not entirely wrong. But if she had known his feelings beforehand, she shouldn't have booked it. Since the situation doesn't specify prior knowledge, maybe she's not the main wrongdoer. The boyfriend's reaction is also problematic because he's not open to discussion. But the question is about the author. So perhaps the answer is B (No), she's not in the wrong because she made an effort to accommodate him once he expressed discomfort, even if she should have checked first. But some might argue she didn't respect his known boundaries. Hmm.\n"
