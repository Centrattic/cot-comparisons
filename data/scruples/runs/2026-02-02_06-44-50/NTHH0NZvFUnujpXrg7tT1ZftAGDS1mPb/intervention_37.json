A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple planned to get massages together. The woman booked her boyfriend with a male masseuse and herself with a female one. The boyfriend is upset because he doesn't want a male masseuse, considering massages as inherently sexual. The woman thinks massages are therapeutic and is trying to understand his reasoning. He feels she's making an argument out of it and insists on canceling his appointment, so she goes alone.\n\nNow, the key points here are consent and personal boundaries. The woman scheduled the appointments without consulting her boyfriend, which is where the issue starts. Even if she thought it was a neutral choice (male and female), she didn't consider his comfort level. Massages can be a sensitive issue for some people, especially regarding opposite-sex masseurs. His reaction is about his own boundaries and comfort, which he has the right to. \n\nThe woman tried to discuss and even offered to switch, but he was adamant. His refusal to switch and wanting to cancel shows that he's uncomfortable. The question is whether her initial action was wrong. Since she made a decision without his input, leading to his discomfort, that could be seen as inconsiderate, even if her intention was neutral. On the other hand, he might be overcomplicating it, but his feelings are valid. \n\nThe woman's insistence on understanding his logic might come across as pushing the issue, especially when he's already expressed discomfort. However, she did offer a solution. But the root of the problem is her not checking with him before scheduling. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is crucial. Even if her intention was good, not consulting him first could be seen as an oversight. So, the author (her) might be in the wrong for not considering his feelings upfront. However, some might argue that the boyfriend is being overly sensitive. \n\nBut given the context, since he clearly stated his discomfort and the situation stemmed from her decision without his input, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). But I need to be careful here. Maybe there's a balance. However, the fact that she scheduled without his input is a key point. So AITA here would likely be A.\n"
