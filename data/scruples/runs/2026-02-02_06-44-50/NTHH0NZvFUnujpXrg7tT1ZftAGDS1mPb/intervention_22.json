  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the situation (the author, a woman) is in the wrong for booking her boyfriend with a male masseuse. They were planning to get massages together, and she chose based on availability. The boyfriend objected, saying massages are inherently sexual and that he won't accept a male masseuse. The author tried to discuss and understand his reasoning but he accused her of making it up and being argumentative. She offered to switch, but he wanted to cancel. She's going ahead without him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to schedule based on availability, which seems neutral. She had no reason to expect an issue, so her initial action might not be wrong. However, the boyfriend's discomfort is valid if he feels massages are sexual. The key points here are consent and comfort. Even if the author didn't mean to cause discomfort, she should have considered his feelings. Maybe she should have asked first, especially since they were doing it together. But since the situation was about availability, maybe it's not her fault. However, after the objection, she tried to explain, and he shut down the conversation. The author tried to resolve it by switching, which shows she was accommodating. The boyfriend's reaction might be over the top, but the author could have handled it better by discussing preferences in advance. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. If the boyfriend had no prior mention of this discomfort, maybe she's not at fault for not knowing. But if he's uncomfortable with opposite-sex interactions in a sexual context, even if he's in a monogamous relationship, his perspective is his own. The author's actions were based on availability, not malice. However, the argument arises from her trying to understand and debate, which he perceived as argumentative. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer might depend on whether she should have known his preference beforehand. Since they were planning it together, maybe she should have checked with him. So, there's a case for her being in the wrong for not considering his feelings before booking. But the situation is complicated, and the boyfriend's reaction might be extreme. The final answer depends on whether the initial booking was a mistake. If she didn't know his preference, she's not wrong. But if she should have considered it, she is. I think the answer is B (No), because she acted based on availability and tried to resolve it when he objected. The boyfriend's discomfort is his issue, and she wasn't intentionally causing it. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
