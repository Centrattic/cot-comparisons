  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple planning to get massages together. The woman scheduled her boyfriend with a male masseuse and herself with a female one. The boyfriend is upset, saying massages are inherently sexual. The woman thinks they're therapeutic and tried to discuss it but he refused and suggested canceling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The woman's action was to book based on her own comfort, maybe assuming gender balance. But the boyfriend's main issue is discomfort with a male masseuse due to seeing massages as sexual. Even if he's in a monogamous relationship, his personal boundaries are being crossed here. The woman tried to explain her reasoning and offered to switch, which shows she's trying to accommodate. But he still refused, leading to conflict.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she might not have considered his specific sensitivity beforehand. Maybe she should have discussed the booking together. However, she did make an effort to adjust after his objection. On the other hand, his reaction seems extreme, but personal discomfort about massages being sexual is subjective. The key is whether her action was wrong. Since she acted without knowing his feelings and tried to resolve it, maybe she's not entirely at fault. But perhaps she should have communicated first. However, the answer might lean towards her not being wrong because she made an effort to understand and adjust.\n"
