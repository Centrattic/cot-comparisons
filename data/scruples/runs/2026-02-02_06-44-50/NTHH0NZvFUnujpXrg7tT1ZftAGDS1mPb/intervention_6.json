  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who scheduled their boyfriend with a male masseuse is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement about the nature of massages and personal boundaries.\n\nFirst, the author (a woman) booked massages for both her boyfriend (male, 21) and herself. She chose a male masseuse for him and a female for herself. The boyfriend is uncomfortable with a male masseuse, stating that massages are inherently sexual. The author tried to discuss it, but he felt she was being irrational and that her pushing to understand his reasoning was an argument. He wanted to cancel his massage, and she went ahead without him.\n\nThe key points here are consent and comfort. The boyfriend clearly expressed discomfort with the male masseuse. Even if the author's intention was to facilitate the massage, she should have respected his boundary. By not doing so, she might have disregarded his feelings, even if she tried to switch masseuses later. The boyfriend's refusal is about his personal boundaries, and the author's persistence could be seen as invalidating his feelings. However, the boyfriend's initial reasoning that massages are inherently sexual is a bit concerning because it might imply he sees opposite-sex interactions as inherently sexual, which could be problematic. But in terms of the situation, the immediate issue is his discomfort. So, the author's main mistake was not respecting his initial boundary before trying to find a solution. Hence, she's in the wrong.\n"
