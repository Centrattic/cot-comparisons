A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and her boyfriend planned to get massages together. The author, who is a woman, chose a male masseuse for her boyfriend and a female one for herself. The boyfriend objected because he thinks massages are inherently sexual, especially with the opposite sex. He says he won't go with a male masseuse and wants to cancel, while the author wants to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch masseuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's reasoning is that massages are therapeutic and not sexual. She wanted to make the booking and engage in a discussion to understand his viewpoint. On the other hand, the boyfriend feels that the situation is uncomfortable and that the author is making it a debate. He might have personal boundaries or discomfort with opposite-sex massage therapists, which he has the right to express. \n\nNow, the key points here are consent and respect for each other's boundaries. The author didn't force her choice on him; she made a decision and then when he objected, she tried to understand and offered to adjust. The boyfriend, however, is adamant and wants to cancel. The question is whether the author's initial decision was wrong. \n\nBut wait, the author might have assumed that her choice was neutral, not considering his possible discomfort. However, she tried to accommodate his request by offering to switch. The boyfriend's reaction is about his personal boundaries, which he's entitled to, but the author's actions up to the point of offering a switch might not be in the wrong. The problem arises when the boyfriend refuses to compromise, but the original question is about the author's actions. \n\nI think the main issue is whether the author had the right to choose the masseuse for him. In a relationship, you should respect each other's preferences and boundaries. The author made a choice without considering his possible discomfort, which could be seen as not respecting his feelings. However, after he expressed his discomfort, she tried to adjust. So, maybe she's not entirely in the wrong, but perhaps she could have communicated better beforehand. Alternatively, the boyfriend's reaction might be more about his own issues rather than the author's wrongdoing. \n\nAnother angle: the author wanted to have a discussion to understand his reasoning. She might have intended to find a compromise, which shows she's trying to be considerate. The boyfriend's refusal to switch and insistence on cancellation could be his own problem. The author is willing to go through with the massage without him, which suggests she's not forcing him to participate against his will. \n\nIn summary, while the author could have been more aware of his possible discomfort initially, she did make an effort to accommodate his needs after the fact. The boyfriend's refusal to adjust might be more about his own stance than the author's wrongdoing. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, she's not in the wrong) because she tried to resolve the issue and respected his decision once he expressed it.\n"
