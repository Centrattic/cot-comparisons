A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a woman, scheduled her boyfriend, who is male, with a male masseuse when they both planned to get massages together. She chose a male for him and a female for herself. Then the boyfriend got upset, saying he wouldn't let a male massage him because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author thought massages are therapeutic and tried to understand his reasoning, but he dismissed her arguments, called her irrational, and refused to switch. She offered to switch, but he wanted to cancel instead. She's going ahead without him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to make a practical decision\u2014there were two options, male and female, so she split them based on gender. That seems neutral, maybe even thoughtful, but maybe she didn't consider his feelings. The boyfriend's discomfort is about the sexual aspect of massages, which he associates with the presence of a male masseuse. He's in a monogamous relationship, but he feels that getting a massage from a male is inappropriate. His reaction is strong\u2014refusing to switch, calling her irrational, and wanting to cancel.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are: Did she overstep by making the decision without checking with him? Did she respect his boundaries? Or was he being unreasonable by not considering her perspective?\n\nOn one hand, she scheduled the appointments, which is a common thing to do when planning together. But maybe she should have discussed the masseuse's gender with him first. He has a right to his comfort level, especially regarding personal and potentially sensitive services. However, his response seems dismissive and confrontational. He turned a simple scheduling issue into an argument by labeling her views as made up and refusing to engage constructively. His unwillingness to switch or at least compromise might be problematic.\n\nThe author tried to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch, which shows she was trying to be accommodating. His reaction, however, was defensive and closed-minded. It's possible that he's projecting his own discomfort onto the situation and not engaging in good faith. The author isn't forcing him to do anything; she's trying to find a solution. By canceling, he's avoiding the issue instead of working through it.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author's actions were based on a neutral decision but perhaps without checking his preferences. However, the boyfriend's response was more about asserting his discomfort without considering her efforts to resolve the issue. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to schedule based on available options and then trying to adapt when he voiced his concerns. The boyfriend's rigid stance and refusal to compromise might be the main issue here.\n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. She made a decision that didn't consider his specific boundaries initially but attempted to resolve it. The boyfriend's reaction was more problematic.\n"
