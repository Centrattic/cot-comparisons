A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for scheduling their boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation is that they both wanted massages together. The author, a woman, booked the male masseuse for her boyfriend and a female one for herself. The boyfriend then refused to accept the male masseuse because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author tried to understand his reasoning, but he accused her of making it up and being argumentative. She offered to switch, but he said to cancel, and she went ahead without him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's intention was to plan a shared activity, possibly trying to make it balanced by matching each with a respective gender masseuse. Maybe she thought that would be fair or comfortable for both. But the boyfriend has a strong discomfort with male masseuses, viewing massages as sexual. He's in a monogamous relationship, so maybe he's okay with female masseuses because of his relationship status, but not male ones. That seems a bit inconsistent, but it's his belief.\n\nThe author tried to understand his reasoning, which is a good step. She offered to switch, showing she's trying to accommodate. But when he refused and wanted to cancel, she went ahead anyway. He might feel she didn't respect his boundaries by pushing the issue, even if she was trying to discuss it. On the other hand, she didn't force him to go; she let him cancel. But the initial act of scheduling without considering his preferences might be the issue. \n\nIs she wrong for not considering his potential discomfort beforehand? Maybe she assumed he was okay with male masseuses, but he wasn't. It's possible she should have asked first instead of assuming. However, she did try to resolve it once he raised the issue. The boyfriend's reaction seems a bit harsh, but his discomfort is valid. The key is whether she overstepped by scheduling the male masseuse without checking with him first. Since the activity was joint, maybe she should have discussed the masseuse's gender with him. But he also might have mentioned his preferences earlier. \n\nIn terms of AITA, the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate because she didn't check his comfort level first. However, she did offer to adjust after he brought it up. The boyfriend's reaction is also problematic because he dismissed her attempts to understand and then canceled. But the question is about the author being in the wrong. If she had discussed it first, maybe the issue wouldn't have arisen. So maybe answer A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because she didn't consider his feelings initially, even though she tried to fix it later.\n"
