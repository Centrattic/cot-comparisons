A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who's a woman, scheduled her boyfriend, a man, with a male masseuse during a joint massage session. She booked herself with a female masseuse. The boyfriend refused to go with the male masseuse, saying that massages are inherently sexual. The author tried to discuss his reasoning, but he got defensive, said she was being irrational, and even offered to cancel his appointment. The author then went ahead without him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that massages are therapeutic and she wanted to book based on the available masseuses. Her boyfriend, however, feels uncomfortable with a male masseuse because he views massages as sexual. That seems like a personal discomfort issue. \n\nBut why would he feel massages are sexual? Maybe it's a cultural or personal belief. In some contexts, massages can be seen as intimate or even used inappropriately. However, in a professional setting, they're supposed to be therapeutic. The boyfriend's refusal might be based on his personal boundaries, which are valid. However, he's also in a monogamous relationship, so why is he okay with a female masseuse? That part is confusing. Maybe he's okay with his girlfriend being massaged by a male, but not himself? That doesn't make sense if he's in a monogamous relationship. Wait, the author points out that if massages are considered sexual, then why is it okay for him to receive a massage from the opposite sex in a relationship? The boyfriend's answer isn't clear here. He might have mixed reasoning.\n\nThe author tried to understand his perspective, which is good. She offered to switch masseuses, showing she's willing to accommodate. But he refused and wanted to cancel. Maybe he was being rigid here. The author then went ahead without him. Is she wrong for scheduling the massage as she did? Probably not. She had no way of knowing his discomfort beforehand. It's the boyfriend's responsibility to communicate his preferences. If he had mentioned it earlier, she could have adjusted. But she acted in good faith based on available options. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems a bit extreme. He called her irrational and accused her of making things up. That's not a healthy way to resolve the issue. The author was trying to have a discussion, not argue. The fact that he refused to switch and wanted to cancel shows he wasn't willing to compromise. The author's right to choose the masseuse, especially since she's the one booking, is reasonable. She also respected his discomfort by offering to switch, but he wouldn't budge. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The boyfriend didn't express his discomfort until after the booking. The author isn't in the wrong for not knowing his preference. She made an effort to accommodate, so the answer is likely B (No). The boyfriend's actions and words were problematic, not the author's.\n"
