A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is at fault for booking her boyfriend with a male masseuse. Let me start by looking at the details.\n\nThe author, a 21-year-old female, and her boyfriend, also 21 and male, planned to get massages together. They had the option of a male or female masseuse, so she booked her boyfriend with the male one and herself with the female. When she told him, he said he wouldn't let a man massage him because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author thinks they're purely therapeutic. She tried to discuss his reasoning, even offered to switch, but he said to cancel his massage. She's going ahead without him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was probably to make it balanced, assigning each of them a masseuse of the opposite gender. But the boyfriend has a boundary here. He feels uncomfortable with a male masseuse because of the sexual connotation. She tried to engage in a discussion to understand his perspective, which shows she's trying to be considerate. However, he seems to be dismissing her attempts, calling her arguments irrational and turning it into an argument. He then refuses to compromise beyond canceling his own massage.\n\nNow, when someone has a personal boundary, even if it seems trivial to others, respecting that is important in a relationship. The author might think she's being fair by assigning opposite genders, but the boyfriend's discomfort is valid for him. However, she also had the option to switch, which she offered. The fact that he didn't accept that offer but instead decided to cancel his own appointment might indicate he wasn't open to compromise. The author then decided to go without him, which seems reasonable if he's unwilling to budge.\n\nBut is the author at fault? She didn't know about his discomfort beforehand. She made a choice based on the information she had. When she learned of his issue, she tried to address it. He, on the other hand, might not have communicated his boundary earlier. But maybe he should have known his own preferences. However, the situation is that the author acted on her own decision, which led to conflict. But she tried to resolve it by offering switches. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about being upset with the situation rather than the author's initial choice. The author isn't forcing him to do anything; he could have chosen to go with the male masseuse. But he chose to cancel. So maybe she isn't in the wrong because she tried to accommodate him when she found out. The problem might be more on the boyfriend's side for not communicating his preference beforehand and then making it a bigger issue than necessary. Therefore, the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
