A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation is that the couple planned to get massages together, and the author chose a male masseuse for her boyfriend and a female for herself. The boyfriend then gets upset, saying he won't allow a male masseuse because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author tries to discuss the reasoning, but he accuses her of being irrational and making it up to argue. The author feels she's just trying to understand his logic and even offered to switch. He ends up saying to cancel his massages.\n\nHmm. So the main question is whether the author is wrong here. Let's break it down. First, the author made a decision without discussing with her boyfriend. She assumed that splitting the masseuses by gender was acceptable, but her boyfriend had a strong negative reaction. The boyfriend feels that massages are sexual, so a male masseuse is out of the question. The author is trying to engage in a discussion, but he shuts it down. \n\nNow, I need to consider both perspectives. The author might argue that she was just trying to be fair by matching genders, not knowing his discomfort. The boyfriend's discomfort could be based on personal boundaries or beliefs. The author could be seen as not respecting his boundaries by initially scheduling the male masseuse. However, she did offer to switch and kept trying to talk it out. The boyfriend's reaction seems extreme, dismissing her attempts to understand and suggesting canceling the appointment rather than compromising. \n\nBut the key point is whether the initial action was wrong. The author didn't check with her boyfriend first. Even if her intention was neutral, if the boyfriend has a valid discomfort, she should have discussed it beforehand. On the other hand, the boyfriend's refusal to engage constructively and his accusation that she's being irrational might shift some blame to him. \n\nHowever, in relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is crucial. The author made an assumption that might not align with her boyfriend's feelings. So even if she tried to resolve it, the initial action of scheduling without discussing could be seen as inconsiderate. But the boyfriend's response also seems to escalate the situation unnecessarily. \n\nI think the author is partially in the wrong for not checking with him first, but the boyfriend's reaction is also problematic. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, maybe the answer is A (Yes), because she should have discussed the choice beforehand. But maybe others might say B (No), because it's a minor issue and the boyfriend's reaction is over the top. \n\nThe user themselves thinks the author is in the wrong. The key factors are the initial decision without discussion and the boyfriend's valid discomfort. So the answer is A.\n"
