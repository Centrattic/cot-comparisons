A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. So the situation is that they both planned to get massages together, and there were two options: male and female. The author chose the male for her boyfriend and female for herself. The boyfriend is upset, saying that massages are inherently sexual and he won't accept a male masseuse. The author tried to discuss it, but he got defensive and said she was arguing just to argue, and even suggested canceling his massage. The author still went ahead without him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's action was a choice based on the available options. She might have thought it was a neutral decision, maybe to have opposite genders for each of them. But the boyfriend has a different perspective, seeing massages as sexual and thus not wanting a male masseus. \n\nThe key points here are communication and respect for boundaries. The author tried to understand his reasoning, which is good, but he responded negatively, calling her irrational and even suggesting to cancel. The author offered to switch, showing flexibility. However, he was unwilling to compromise, leading to the situation where she went without him.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she made a choice that the boyfriend found uncomfortable, but she tried to address his concerns, it's a matter of whether her initial decision was problematic. However, unless there was a prior agreement about masseuse gender, she might not be wrong for making a choice that the boyfriend didn't anticipate. On the other hand, maybe she should have checked with him before booking, but the scenario doesn't mention any prior issues about massage preferences. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems a bit extreme, especially since he had the option to choose. The author tried to resolve it by offering to switch, so she's not being inconsiderate. The main issue is the boyfriend's discomfort and his response to the situation. The author isn't forcing him to have a male masseuse; she just made a choice that he later found unacceptable. But since she tried to adjust, it's hard to say she's at fault here. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
