  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple getting massages together. The woman (author) scheduled her boyfriend with a male masseuse and herself with a female one. The boyfriend got upset, saying massages are inherently sexual and that he won't let a man massage him. The author tried to understand his reasoning, offered to switch, but he refused and wanted to cancel. The author is going ahead without him.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points here are about consent, personal boundaries, and communication. The author made a decision that affected her boyfriend's comfort. Even though she was trying to be considerate by splitting the genders, she didn't consider his personal feelings beforehand. The boyfriend has a valid reason for being uncomfortable, as he thinks massages have a sexual connotation. \n\nThe author's intention was to split the masseuses, which is understandable, but she didn't check with him first. She tried to explain her reasoning and offered to switch, which shows she was trying to resolve it. However, the initial action was to assign him a male masseuse without his consent. The boyfriend felt she was pushing her own logic and making an argument out of it, which he found irrational.\n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is crucial. Even if the author believes massages are therapeutic, her boyfriend's discomfort is real. The fact that he was firm in his refusal and wanted to cancel suggests that her initial decision crossed a line, even if she tried to adjust later. She might have overstepped by imposing her choice without prior discussion.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction could be seen as extreme. He didn't want to compromise and refused to switch, leading to a cancellation. But the author's main fault was not checking with him before making the booking. So, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because she didn't consider his feelings first.\n"
