A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author (a woman) booked massages for her boyfriend and herself. She chose a male masseuse for him and a female for herself. The boyfriend objects, saying massages are inherently sexual and he won't accept a male masseuse. The author tried to discuss and understand his reasoning, even offered to switch, but he refused and suggested canceling. She's going to go without him.\n\nSo, first, I need to consider both sides. The author might think that choosing the masseuse based on gender is irrational, especially since she's in a monogamous relationship and doesn't see the sexual aspect. The boyfriend, on the other hand, feels that massages are sexual in nature, possibly because of the close personal contact or societal norms he's uncomfortable with.\n\nIs the author wrong for booking him with a male masseuse? Well, she might not have known his discomfort beforehand. But when he expressed it, she tried to accommodate by offering to switch. He refused, so she went ahead. The question is whether pushing for that choice despite his clear discomfort makes her wrong.\n\nThe boyfriend's discomfort might be valid if it's a personal boundary. Even if the author disagrees with the reasoning, his feelings are real. She tried to understand, but he shut down the discussion. However, she did offer alternatives. The key here is whether respecting his comfort is more important than her initial choice. Since she offered to switch and he didn't accept, maybe she's not in the wrong. But some might argue she should have checked with him first instead of assuming.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reasoning that massages are inherently sexual might be a personal belief, but it's unclear if that's a common view. However, his reaction seems extreme\u2014refusing to go at all rather than just changing the masseuse. The author's attempt to understand and compromise might show she's not being inconsiderate.\n\nIn terms of AITA, the community usually considers intent and actions. The author tried to be accommodating, so maybe she's not wrong. The boyfriend's refusal to budge could be his own issue. So the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
