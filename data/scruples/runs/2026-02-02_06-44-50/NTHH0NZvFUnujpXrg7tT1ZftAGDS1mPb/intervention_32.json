A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author scheduled her boyfriend with a male masseuse, and he's upset about it. She thought it was okay because she believed massages are therapeutic, but he finds them inherently sexual and is uncomfortable. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author and her boyfriend planned to get massages together. The availability of male and female masseuses led her to assign each of them a different gender. She chose the male for him and female for herself. But when she told him, he refused, saying massages with the opposite sex are sexual. She tried to discuss his reasoning, but he dismissed her and even suggested canceling instead of switching. She went ahead without him.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's at fault. The key points here are consent, communication, and respect for boundaries. The author made a decision without considering her boyfriend's comfort level. Even if she thought the choice was neutral, she should have discussed it with him first. By scheduling him with a male masseuse without his input, she might have overlooked his personal boundaries. Her intention was to understand his reasoning, but he felt she was arguing. However, the main issue is that she didn't check in with him before making the arrangement. It's important in a relationship to respect each other's comfort zones, especially when it comes to physical interactions with others. Offering to switch later shows she tried to be flexible, but the initial action of not consulting him first could be seen as the root of the problem. So, while he's entitled to his feelings, the author's responsibility was to communicate better from the start. Therefore, she might be in the wrong for not respecting his boundaries upfront.\n"
