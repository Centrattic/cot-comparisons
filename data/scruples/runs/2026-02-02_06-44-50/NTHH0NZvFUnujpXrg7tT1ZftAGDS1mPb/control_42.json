A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation involves a disagreement between the couple about the appropriateness of a male masseuse. The boyfriend is uncomfortable, saying massages are inherently sexual, while the author thinks they're purely therapeutic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author made a choice based on her understanding of the services, maybe thinking it's just about getting a massage. But the boyfriend's discomfort is real to him. The key points here are consent, comfort levels, and communication. \n\nThe author tried to explain her reasoning and even offered to switch, which shows she's trying to be accommodating. However, the boyfriend's refusal might indicate that his boundary is being respected here. The question is whether the author overstepped by not considering his feelings beforehand. \n\nBut wait, when you book something for someone else, especially a personal service like a massage, their comfort is crucial. The author might have assumed it's a neutral service and overlooked that for some people, the gender of the service provider matters. Even if the author's intention was good, not discussing this beforehand could be seen as a misstep. However, she did try to address his concerns after the fact. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's response seems extreme. He's refusing to proceed and even suggesting to cancel, which might be an overreaction. But his feelings of discomfort are valid if he associates massages with something sexual. The author's approach was to debate the issue, which might have escalated the tension instead of resolving it. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for not checking with him before booking, even if her intention was to split the bookings equally. In relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is important. However, the boyfriend's reaction could also be overly rigid. \n\nBut since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the main issue is her decision to book without considering his possible discomfort. She had the assumption that it's purely therapeutic, but she should have communicated first. So, maybe she's in the wrong for not checking with him. However, some might argue that she had no way of knowing, and the boyfriend's reaction is unreasonable. \n\nThe answer might hinge on cultural or personal norms. In some contexts, the idea of opposite-sex massages might be a sensitive topic. The author's attempt to understand his reasoning is good, but the initial action of booking without discussion is where the issue lies. \n\nTherefore, the answer could be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because she didn't consider his comfort level beforehand. However, others might say B (No) because she tried to resolve it and he overreacted. But based on typical relationship advice, respecting boundaries and communication are key, so the author's action, while well-intentioned, may have overlooked his feelings.\n"
