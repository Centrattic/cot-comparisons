A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for scheduling their boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation is that they both wanted massages, and the author chose the male masseuse for her boyfriend, who then objected because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author tried to understand his reasoning and offered to switch, but he refused and wanted to cancel. The author is going ahead without him.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The author's reasoning is that it's a therapeutic choice, and she tried to accommodate his discomfort by offering to switch. On the other hand, the boyfriend has a personal boundary about male masseurs, which he considers a deal-breaker. \n\nIs the author wrong for making the initial choice? Well, she didn't know his preference beforehand. It's possible she assumed he'd be okay with it. But when he expressed discomfort, she tried to adjust. Her intention seems to be about understanding and accommodating, not forcing him. The boyfriend's reaction is strong\u2014he's refusing to have the massage at all, which is his right. But does that mean the author is in the wrong? Probably not. She made an error in not checking his preference first, but once he expressed his issue, she tried to resolve it. The key point is that the author wasn't trying to make an argument but to understand his perspective. The boyfriend's refusal to switch and cancellation might be his own issue with boundaries, not her fault. \n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. She made a decision without full information but acted responsibly when confronted with his discomfort.\n"
