  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about scheduling a boyfriend with a male masseuse when he's uncomfortable with it. The author, a woman, booked her boyfriend with a male masseuse and a female for herself. The boyfriend objects, saying massages are inherently sexual and refuses to go. The author tried to understand his reasoning, offered to switch, but he wanted to cancel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to split the masseuse genders, maybe to match each person's preference or to avoid any awkwardness. However, the boyfriend feels that massages have a sexual connotation, especially from the opposite sex. He argues that it's not just a therapeutic act but has sexual undertones. The author thinks that's irrational and wants to debate why he feels that way. She even offers to change the booking, but he insists on canceling.\n\nNow, who's in the wrong? The key points here are consent, comfort levels, and communication. The boyfriend was uncomfortable with the male masseuse, so the author should have respected his feelings. Even though she offered to switch, his main issue might be with any opposite-sex masseuse, making the switch not a viable solution. The author's insistence on discussing and debating his reasons might have come off as dismissive of his genuine discomfort. While it's good she tried to understand, the boyfriend's feelings are valid if he perceives massages as sexual. The author might be in the wrong for not anticipating his discomfort and pushing the issue despite his clear hesitance. On the other hand, the boyfriend's refusal to compromise beyond canceling could be a problem, but the initial decision to book him with a male masseuse was based on her assumption rather than his preferences. So the main fault lies with the author for not respecting his boundaries.\n"
