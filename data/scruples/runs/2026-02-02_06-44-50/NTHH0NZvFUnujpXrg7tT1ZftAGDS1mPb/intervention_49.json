A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author (a woman) and her boyfriend planned to get massages together. There were two options: a male masseuse for the boyfriend and a female for her. She booked them accordingly. When she told him, he was upset and said he wouldn't allow a man to massage him because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. She argues they're therapeutic and tries to discuss his reasoning. He accuses her of arguing just to argue and says she's wrong. He refuses to switch and wants to cancel his massage, so she goes alone.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the situation. \n\nFirst, the main issue is about respecting personal boundaries. The boyfriend clearly stated he's uncomfortable with a male masseuse, citing that massages are sexual. The author, thinking they're therapeutic, tried to understand his reasoning. She even offered to switch. But he refused and wanted to cancel. \n\nIs the author wrong for booking him with a male masseuse without considering his discomfort? Well, she did ask and then tried to discuss, but maybe she should have considered his feelings first. But the boyfriend had the option to decline if he was uncomfortable. However, the author might not have known his stance until after booking. But then she tried to resolve it by offering a switch. He didn't accept and instead wanted to cancel. \n\nThe key points: Did the author act in bad faith? She wanted to understand his reasons, so maybe she wasn't trying to push her will. But maybe she should have respected his initial discomfort without trying to debate it. However, he had the chance to say no before she booked. Alternatively, if he didn't communicate his discomfort earlier, maybe the author isn't at fault. \n\nOn the other hand, if he's in a monogamous relationship and he's okay with a female masseuse, then why is a male one an issue? That's part of the argument. The author is trying to understand his logic. But he's dismissing her arguments as irrational. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, since the author made an effort to accommodate after he expressed discomfort, but he refused any solution, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. But initiating the booking without prior discussion could be an issue. However, the boyfriend had the agency to decline himself. \n\nI think the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she tried to resolve it and he refused to compromise. But I'm a bit conflicted because maybe she should have checked first. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction seems extreme, especially since he's comfortable with a female masseuse in a monogamous relationship. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
