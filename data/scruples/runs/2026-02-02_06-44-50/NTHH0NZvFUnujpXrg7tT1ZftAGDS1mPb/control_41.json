  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author booking their boyfriend with a male masseuse and the boyfriend being upset about it, claiming massages are inherently sexual. The author tried to discuss it and even offered to switch, but the boyfriend wanted to cancel. The user wants a yes or no answer based on the provided options.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author made a decision without consulting the boyfriend, which led to discomfort. The boyfriend feels massages are sexual, so the author's action might have crossed a line. The author tried to understand his reasoning but ended up in an argument. The boyfriend's discomfort is significant enough that he's willing to cancel the appointment. \n\nOn one hand, the author might have thought they were being considerate by matching genders, but didn't realize the boyfriend had a strong issue with it. On the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction seems extreme, but his feelings are valid. The key point is that the author didn't get consent or check with the boyfriend first. Respecting a partner's boundaries is important, even if the reasoning seems irrational. So, even if the author's intention was good, not discussing it beforehand could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't respect the boyfriend's boundaries by not consulting him first.\n"
