A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for booking her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation is that both the author and her boyfriend had planned to get massages together. The author chose a male masseuse for her boyfriend and a female one for herself. The boyfriend then gets upset, saying that massages are inherently sexual and that he's uncomfortable with a male masseuse. The author tries to understand his reasoning, but he accuses her of being irrational and wants to cancel his massage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's intention was to split the masseuses by gender, probably to make it more comfortable for both. She thought massages are therapeutic. The boyfriend feels that massages have a sexual connotation, so he's not okay with a male masseuse. He's also frustrated with the author's push to understand his reasoning, seeing it as an argument.\n\nNow, the key points here are autonomy and communication. The author made a choice without considering her boyfriend's explicit preferences. Even though she might have thought it was neutral, she didn't check in with him first. On the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction seems harsh. He's dismissing her attempts to understand, which is not constructive. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries and preferences is important. The author scheduled the massage without considering his discomfort, even if she didn't know about it beforehand. However, the boyfriend's assertion that it's inherently sexual might be his personal discomfort, and she tried to accommodate by offering to switch. His refusal and wanting to cancel might be an overreaction, but the initial action of the author could have been handled better by discussing it first.\n\nBut the main issue is whether she's in the wrong. Since she didn't know his preference beforehand, maybe she isn't entirely at fault. However, in a relationship, partners should check in with each other on such decisions, especially when they involve the other person's comfort. So maybe she should have asked first. But the boyfriend's response was also not cooperative. The user is asking if she's in the wrong. The answer depends on whether making the decision without checking is wrong. Since it's a shared activity, she should have involved him in the decision. Therefore, she might be in the wrong for not considering his feelings upfront. But the boyfriend's reaction is also problematic. However, the question is about the author. So, the answer might be A (Yes) because she made a choice without considering his preference, even if it wasn't fully her fault. But sometimes in these situations, both parties have some responsibility. The boyfriend's response is extreme, but the author's action is the trigger. So, maybe the answer is A because she didn't check first. Alternatively, she might not be in the wrong because she tried to accommodate by switching. Hmm. Maybe B (No) because her intention was good and she tried to adjust. But the initial action of scheduling without consulting is where the issue is. I'm a bit torn. However, in relationships, assuming you know the other person's preference without discussing can be seen as dismissive. So, the answer is A.\n"
