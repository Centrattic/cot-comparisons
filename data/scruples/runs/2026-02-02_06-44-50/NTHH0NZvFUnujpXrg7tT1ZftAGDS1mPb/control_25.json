A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. Let me go through the details carefully.\n\nSo, the scenario: The couple planned to get massages together. The author chose a male masseuse for her boyfriend and a female one for herself. When she told him, he refused to have a male masseuse, saying massages are inherently sexual. She tried to discuss and understand his reasoning, thinking they're therapeutic. He called her views irrational, and even when she offered to switch, he wanted to cancel. She went ahead without him.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The author's action was based on practicality\u2014booking based on availability. She didn't know his discomfort beforehand. He had a strong opinion about massages being sexual, which he didn't communicate earlier. She tried to understand, offered solutions, but he was rigid. \n\nIs she wrong? Well, she made a choice without knowing his preference. But she tried to resolve it by switching. He was resistant and didn't want to compromise. His initial discomfort should have been communicated before booking. However, her approach wasn't malicious; she wanted to understand. \n\nThe key points: Did she overstep? Maybe not. He had the chance to express his feelings but reacted negatively. She's in a relationship where communication is important. He might be wrong for not being open to discussion, but she's not in the wrong for making a practical choice and trying to fix it. \n\nI think the answer is B (No). She's not the one at fault here. Her actions were reasonable, and his reaction was more about his own discomfort and not effectively communicating it. She tried to accommodate, which shows she valued his feelings. The problem was his rigid stance, not her initial decision.\n"
