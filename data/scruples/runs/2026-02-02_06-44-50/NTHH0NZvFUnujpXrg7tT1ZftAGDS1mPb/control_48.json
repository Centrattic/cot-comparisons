A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation is that they both wanted massages together, and she chose a male for him and female for herself. He's upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual, so a male masseuse makes him uncomfortable. She tried to understand his reasoning, but he dismissed her arguments and even suggested canceling his massage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and comfort levels. The boyfriend has the right to feel uncomfortable with a male masseuse, especially if he associates massages with something sexual. Even though the author thinks massages are therapeutic, each person's perception can differ. By booking him with a male masseuse without considering his feelings, maybe she overstepped. She did offer to switch, but he refused and wanted to cancel, which complicates things.\n\nBut then, the author is trying to understand his reasoning and even offers to switch, which shows she's trying to accommodate. However, he becomes defensive and calls her argumentative. That part might indicate that he's not open to discussion. But the initial action of booking him with a male masseuse without his input is where the conflict starts. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is key. If the boyfriend expressed discomfort beforehand, the author should have considered that. However, there's no mention of prior discussion about this. So maybe the author assumed he was okay with it since they were getting massages together. But since he's now uncomfortable, maybe she should have checked in first.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reasoning that massages are inherently sexual seems problematic. It might be a personal insecurity or a misunderstanding. The author's approach to debate and understand might have been a way to find common ground, but he shut down the conversation. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are: she scheduled without considering his comfort, but tried to resolve it. He dismissed her efforts and escalated the situation. \n\nI think the author's initial action was careless in not checking his preference, but she made an effort to fix it. However, the boyfriend's refusal to compromise might be his fault. But the question is about the author's wrong. Since she didn't consider his feelings upfront, maybe she is partially at fault. But since she tried to make it right, maybe not entirely. \n\nBut the main issue is that she scheduled him with a male masseuse without his consent. Even if she thought it was fair (like matching genders), if he's uncomfortable, that's his right. So the author might be in the wrong for not respecting his comfort level initially. However, the boyfriend's reaction also seems extreme. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is on whether the action was wrong. The author's action was scheduling without his input, which is a valid issue. But the boyfriend's subsequent behavior is also part of the problem. However, the question is about the author's wrongdoing. So maybe the answer is A, she is in the wrong for not considering his comfort first, even if she tried to fix it later. But some might argue that the boyfriend's reaction is more at fault. But since the question is about the author, the answer could be A.\n"
