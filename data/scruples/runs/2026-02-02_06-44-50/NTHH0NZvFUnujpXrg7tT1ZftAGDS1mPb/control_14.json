A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the scenario.\n\nThe author, a woman, booked massages for both herself and her boyfriend. She chose a male masseuse for him and a female one for herself. When the boyfriend finds out, he's upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual, especially with someone of the opposite sex. The author thinks massages are purely therapeutic and tries to discuss his reasoning, which leads to an argument. The boyfriend ends up saying they should cancel his massage and the author goes ahead without him.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author made a decision without consulting her boyfriend, the boyfriend feels uncomfortable with a male masseuse, and the author tried to understand his reasoning but the conversation turned into an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author was wrong by making the booking without his input. Couples often make decisions together, especially when it involves both of them. Maybe she should have discussed it before booking. However, maybe she thought it was a small thing, but since it's about personal comfort, it's important.\n\nThe boyfriend's discomfort: he says massages are sexual. That seems subjective. Some people might not feel that way, but if he does, it's his personal boundary. The author pushing to understand might be good, but if he's uncomfortable, forcing the issue could be problematic. However, the author offered to switch, so she was accommodating.\n\nThe argument part: the author wanted to debate the issue, but the boyfriend found it annoying. Maybe she should have respected his discomfort without trying to debate it. But she did offer a solution, so maybe she tried to resolve it.\n\nThe conclusion is whether she was wrong. The boyfriend's discomfort is valid, and not consulting him could be a point against her. However, she did offer to switch, which shows willingness to adjust. Since she respected his choice in the end by going alone, maybe she's not at fault. But the initial decision without his input might be an issue.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If she had asked first, there wouldn't be a problem. But since she made the choice and then tried to work it out, maybe she's not wrong. It's a bit of a gray area. I think the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because she tried to resolve it and respected his decision in the end, even though the initial booking was without his input.\n"
