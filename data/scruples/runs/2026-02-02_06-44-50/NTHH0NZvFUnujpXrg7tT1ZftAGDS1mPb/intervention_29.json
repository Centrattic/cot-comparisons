A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about scheduling a boyfriend with a male masseuse when they planned to get massages together. The boyfriend is uncomfortable with male masseuses because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author tried to discuss and understand his reasoning, even offered to switch, but he said she's being irrational and just wants to cancel his appointments. The author is going to go without him.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author's reasoning is that massages are therapeutic and wanted to proceed as planned. The boyfriend's issue is about comfort with male masseuses, possibly due to personal beliefs or past experiences. The author tried to engage in a discussion, which is reasonable, but the boyfriend felt it was an argument. The key points here are about respecting personal boundaries and mutual understanding.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The answer depends on whether she should have considered his comfort first. Since they were planning to go together, she might have assumed he's okay with either gender. But when he expressed discomfort, her insistence on debating could be seen as dismissive. However, she did offer to switch, which shows willingness to accommodate. The boyfriend's refusal to switch and insistence on cancellation might be his way of setting a boundary. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is crucial. Even if the author believes massages are non-sexual, she should respect her boyfriend's feelings. The fact that he felt it was too much trouble and wanted to cancel might indicate that the situation is more about his personal discomfort than just the argument. So, the author's actions might not be wrong per se, but her approach in handling his discomfort could be. However, the main issue is whether scheduling a male masseuse was wrong. Since it was her choice and she offered a solution, maybe she's not in the wrong. But the boyfriend's reaction shows it's a sensitive issue. I think the answer is A, meaning the author is in the wrong because she didn't consider his comfort first and turned it into a debate instead of respecting his immediate discomfort.\n"
