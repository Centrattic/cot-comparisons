A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about scheduling a male masseuse for her boyfriend, who then objects because he finds massages inherently sexual.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and her boyfriend both planned to get massages together. They had the option of male or female masseuses, so she booked her boyfriend with the male one and herself with the female. He gets upset, saying he won't let a man massage him because he thinks massages are sexual. The author thinks they're therapeutic and tries to understand his reasoning. He accuses her of making it up to argue, calls her irrational, and even says she's wrong for pushing it. She offers to switch, but he wants to cancel, and she ends up going without him.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The user already thinks she is, but wants to confirm. Let me think about this from different angles. \n\nOn one hand, the author might have thought she was being considerate by booking the available masseuses, not anticipating his discomfort. She tried to understand his perspective and even offered a solution. But maybe she didn't consider his feelings beforehand. On the other hand, he had a strong reaction and shut down communication, which could be his fault too. \n\nBut the main issue is whether she overstepped by scheduling him with a male masseuse despite his potential discomfort. If he didn't mention his preference beforehand, maybe she didn't know. However, even if she didn't know, once he expressed discomfort, she tried to resolve it. He then escalated the issue by refusing to go and calling her irrational. \n\nThe key here is that the author's action wasn't malicious. She made a choice based on the available options. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about his personal boundaries and how he handled the conflict. The author's intention was to book massages for both, and when faced with his objection, she attempted to compromise. \n\nHowever, maybe she should have discussed the masseus choices with him before booking, but since they were going together, perhaps she assumed splitting the genders was okay. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn terms of who is at fault: The boyfriend's refusal to engage constructively and his harsh reaction might indicate that he's not handling the situation well. The author, while maybe not considering his potential discomfort upfront, tried to address it. So perhaps the blame isn't entirely on her. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because she wasn't intentionally causing discomfort and made efforts to resolve the issue once it came up. The boyfriend's rigid stance and unwillingness to compromise might be the larger issue here.\n"
