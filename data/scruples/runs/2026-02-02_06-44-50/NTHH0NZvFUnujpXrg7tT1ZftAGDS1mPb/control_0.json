  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple who planned to get massages together. The author (girlfriend) booked her boyfriend with a male masseuse and herself with a female one. The boyfriend then gets upset because he doesn't want a male masseuse, saying massages are inherently sexual. The author thinks they're purely therapeutic and tried to discuss his reasoning, but he gets defensive and says she's wrong. He even suggests canceling the massages instead of switching.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to make the booking, maybe thinking they could both get the best available masseuse or just split them. She tried to understand his perspective and even offered to switch, which shows she's trying to accommodate him. On the other hand, the boyfriend has a discomfort with male masseuses, possibly due to his belief that massages have a sexual connotation. His reaction seems to be more about his personal discomfort rather than her actions being inherently wrong.\n\nNow, the key points: Did the author overstep by booking him with a male masseuse without discussing it first? Maybe. But she did mention that they were both getting massages together, so perhaps she assumed they'd just split the genders. However, the boyfriend's discomfort is valid in the sense that people have different boundaries. The author tried to engage in a discussion, which is good, but the boyfriend shut it down by calling her arguments irrational and then wanting to cancel completely. That seems like a harsh reaction.\n\nIs the author wrong? She wanted to understand his reasoning and even offered a solution. The boyfriend's refusal to compromise and the dismissive attitude might make him the one in the wrong here. The author isn't forcing him to do anything; she's trying to respect his boundaries after the fact. The act of booking a male masseuse might have been a mistake in not checking first, but the way he handled the situation seems more problematic. So, probably the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
