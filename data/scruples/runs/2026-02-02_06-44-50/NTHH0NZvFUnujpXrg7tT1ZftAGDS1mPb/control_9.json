  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The question is about booking a male masseuse for her boyfriend, who then objects. The user wants to know if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The couple planned to get massages together. The woman chose a male masseuse for her boyfriend and a female for herself. The boyfriend is uncomfortable because he thinks massages are sexual. She tries to discuss it, but he shuts down the conversation and refuses to switch, even suggesting canceling. She ends up going alone.\n\nThe key points here are about consent and discomfort. The woman didn't ask for the male masseuse to make him uncomfortable, but she did make a choice without considering his feelings. However, she did offer to switch after he expressed discomfort, which shows she tried to accommodate. The boyfriend's issue is with the perception of massages being sexual, which might be a personal belief. But he's in a committed relationship, so maybe his reasoning isn't entirely valid. The woman's intent was to plan something for both, but she didn't check in beforehand. \n\nIs she wrong for not considering his preferences initially? Maybe a bit. However, after he expressed discomfort, she tried to resolve it. The boyfriend's response seems extreme, refusing to switch and canceling. But the woman isn't wrong for trying to understand his stance. She didn't force him to proceed without a switch. The main question is whether her initial action was wrong. Since she made a choice without prior discussion, there's a bit of fault there, but she attempted to fix it. The boyfriend's reaction is also part of the issue. \n\nConsidering all that, the woman isn't entirely in the wrong. She made a mistake by not discussing the choice beforehand but tried to correct it. The answer is B (No), she's not in the wrong.\n"
