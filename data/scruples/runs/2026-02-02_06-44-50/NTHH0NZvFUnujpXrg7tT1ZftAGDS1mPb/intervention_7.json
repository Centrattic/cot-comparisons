A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation here. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The boyfriend got upset, saying massages are inherently sexual, and he refused to proceed. The author tried to understand his reasoning but he shut down the conversation, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author wanted them to get massages together, and she chose the masseuses based on availability. She picked a male for him and female for herself. The boyfriend objected because he views massages as sexual, which he didn't express earlier. The author tried to discuss and even offered to switch, but he refused and said canceling was too much trouble.\n\nNow, the key points: Was the author wrong? She made a decision assuming it's a therapeutic activity, which she had the right to do. However, she might not have considered the boyfriend's potential discomfort. But the boyfriend didn't communicate his boundaries beforehand. When the issue arose, the author tried to resolve it by offering a switch, but he was inflexible. The boyfriend's reaction seems extreme and possibly based on his own misconceptions. The author's intention was to plan a shared activity, not to make it an argument. She was trying to understand his reasoning, which shows she's open to compromise. The boyfriend's refusal to switch and dismissing her as irrational could be the real issue here. The author isn't in the wrong for making a choice that was reasonable and then trying to accommodate his concerns. The boyfriend's rigid stance and unwillingness to adjust might place more responsibility on him. So, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
