A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for booking her boyfriend with a male masseuse. \n\nFirst, the situation: They planned to get massages together. The author chose male for her boyfriend and female for herself. The boyfriend refuses, saying massages are inherently sexual. She tried to discuss it, but he called her irrational and didn't want to switch, leading her to go alone.\n\nNow, the key points. The author's decision was based on equal treatment, maybe thinking it's fair to alternate or just picking available options. The boyfriend has a strong personal belief that massages are sexual, especially with the opposite sex. He's uncomfortable and wants to cancel. The author tried to understand his reasoning but he shut the conversation down, even refusing to switch.\n\nIs the author wrong? She made a choice based on her own view of massages as therapeutic. She didn't know his personal boundaries beforehand. She tried to accommodate by offering a switch, but he refused. So, she respected his decision in the end by going alone. \n\nThe boyfriend's issue is his own discomfort, which is valid. But he's dismissing her perspective and not engaging constructively. The author isn't forcing him; she's allowing him to back out. The problem might be more about communication\u2014maybe she should have asked his preference first. But she didn't know about his belief, so she can't be blamed for that oversight. \n\nIn terms of wrongdoing, the author isn't in the wrong because she made an innocent choice and tried to resolve the issue. The boyfriend's refusal and dismissive attitude might be the real issue here. So the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
