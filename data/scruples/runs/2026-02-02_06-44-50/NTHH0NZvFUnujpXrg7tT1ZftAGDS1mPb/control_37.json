A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. \n\nFirst, the situation: They planned to get massages together. The author chose a male masseuse for her boyfriend and a female for herself. The boyfriend is uncomfortable with a male masseuse, saying massages are inherently sexual. The author thinks they're therapeutic and wants to understand his reasoning. He refuses to switch and cancels his massage, making her go alone. She's asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let me break this down. The main points are about consent and mutual comfort. The boyfriend has a clear discomfort with a male masseuse. The author thought she was being considerate by assigning based on gender, but maybe she didn't consider his feelings. When he expressed discomfort, she tried to understand but he refused to switch. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, she did schedule him with a male masseuse without considering his feelings. Even if her intention was to be fair (maybe she thought same gender for each), she should have checked in with him first. But when he expressed discomfort, she tried to discuss and even offered to switch. He refused and canceled. \n\nSo, maybe the main issue is that she didn't ask him first. But in relationships, people have different comfort levels. If she had asked, she might have known his preference. But he's the one who decided the massage was too much trouble and canceled. So, maybe she's not in the wrong because she tried to accommodate his request, but perhaps she should have checked in with him before booking. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nThe boyfriend's argument is that massages are sexual, which is a personal belief. The author thinks they're therapeutic. But his discomfort is valid. She tried to understand, but he dismissed her intentions as arguing. He then canceled, which is his choice. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because she made an effort to understand and adjust. The boyfriend's refusal to switch might be more about his own stance. The author didn't force him; she offered to switch, but he said no. So she's not at fault for trying to go along and still attending without him. \n\nSo the answer is probably B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). She made a mistake in not checking with him first, but once he expressed discomfort, she tried to adjust. He ultimately chose not to go, so the fault isn't hers.\n"
