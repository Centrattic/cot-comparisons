  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The couple planned to get massages together. The author, a woman, booked her boyfriend (a man) with a male masseuse and herself with a female one. When she tells him, he objects and says he won't let a man massage him. He claims massages are inherently sexual. The author thinks they're therapeutic and tries to discuss his reasoning. He calls her opinion irrational and says she's making it up. She offers to switch, but he wants to cancel. She goes anyway without him.\n\nNow, determining who's in the wrong. The key points here are consent and comfort. The author made a decision without considering her boyfriend's comfort. Even though her intention was to split the masseuse genders, she didn't check with him first. He has a clear discomfort with male masseurs, citing it as a sexual issue. She tried to discuss it, but he was dismissive. However, she did offer to switch, so she was trying to accommodate. But maybe the initial action was wrong because she didn't confirm his preference before booking. \n\nIs it her fault? She might have overstepped by not checking with him. Even if her intention was neutral, his discomfort is valid. But she was trying to be fair by splitting the genders. However, maybe she should have asked first. His reaction being dismissive and confrontational isn't great either. But the question is about her being in the wrong. Since she acted without his input, leading to his discomfort, she might be at fault. However, it's a minor issue. But the options are A or B. The answer leans towards A because she didn't consider his preference beforehand. But some might say B because he's being overly sensitive. Hmm.\n"
