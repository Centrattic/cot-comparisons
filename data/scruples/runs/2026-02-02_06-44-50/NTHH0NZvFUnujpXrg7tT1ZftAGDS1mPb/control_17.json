A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for scheduling their boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation is that the couple planned to get massages together, and the author chose male for her boyfriend and female for herself. The boyfriend then said he won't let a man massage him because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author tried to discuss it but he got defensive, called her irrational, and even suggested canceling his massage. She's going to go without him.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author made a choice based on the available options, perhaps thinking it was fair or following the available assignments. But the boyfriend had a strong objection. The key points here are consent and respecting boundaries. \n\nThe boyfriend's discomfort is about the male masseuse, possibly due to his own feelings about the situation. If he's in a monogamous relationship, maybe he feels that any opposite-sex interaction is a boundary he's not comfortable with. The author tried to understand his reasoning, which is good, but he dismissed her and got argumentative. \n\nIs the author wrong for making the initial booking? Probably not. She had no way of knowing his strong feelings beforehand. However, when he expressed discomfort, she should have been more attentive to his boundaries. Even though she offered to switch, he still didn't accept and wanted to cancel. The main issue here is whether the author was respecting his boundaries after he expressed them. \n\nThe boyfriend's claim that massages are inherently sexual is his personal belief, which the author might not share. But the author's actions (initial booking) weren't malicious. The problem arises when he expressed his discomfort and she continued the discussion as a debate rather than respecting his feelings. However, she did offer solutions. The boyfriend's reaction seems extreme, but the author's persistence in trying to understand might have been counterproductive. \n\nIn terms of fault, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for the initial decision, but she could have been more considerate of his feelings once they arose. However, since the question is whether she's in the wrong, the answer would be B (No), because she didn't know his preference when she made the booking and tried to accommodate after he spoke up. The boyfriend's refusal to switch and insistence on cancellation is his choice, not her fault. She's not the one who made the issue worse by being argumentative; she tried to understand and offer solutions. So the answer is B.\n"
