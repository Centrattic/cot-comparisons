A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about scheduling a boyfriend with a male masseuse. The author chose to book the boyfriend with a male masseuse and herself with a female one. The boyfriend is upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual and doesn't want a male masseus. The author tried to discuss and understand his reasoning, offered to switch, but he refused and wanted to cancel. The question is whether she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author probably thought it was fair to split the genders since they were both getting massages. But the boyfriend has a strong discomfort with male masseuses, which he attributes to the sexual nature of massages. The author argues massages are therapeutic, which might be a cultural or personal belief difference.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she tried to accommodate by offering to switch, which shows she's trying to respect his boundaries. However, she initially made the choice to assign him the male masseus. Maybe she should have asked first? But since they were planning to do it together, maybe splitting by gender is a common practice. However, not everyone feels comfortable with that. The boyfriend's reaction seems extreme, but his reasoning about massages being sexual might be his personal belief. \n\nThe author's intention was to plan the massages, but she didn't consider his specific preferences. Even though she offered to switch later, the fact that she made the decision without prior discussion might be where she's wrong. But in some cases, people might not disclose preferences until asked. The question is whether scheduling without consultation is wrong. The boyfriend's response of canceling seems a bit harsh, but maybe he's justified in his discomfort. So, the author might not be entirely at fault because she tried to resolve it, but maybe she should have checked with him first. However, the boyfriend's reaction is also problematic. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's about who is more at fault. The author tried to resolve it, so maybe she's not entirely wrong. The boyfriend's stance is rigid. So, the answer might be B, not in the wrong. But maybe there's a nuance here. Did she have the right to assume the gender assignment? If they were doing it together, maybe splitting by gender is standard, but if the boyfriend has a specific issue, she should have considered that. But since he didn't mention it before, maybe she's not at fault. I think the answer is B. She's not in the wrong because she tried to accommodate and the boyfriend's refusal is his own choice. But there's a balance. The answer is B.\n"
