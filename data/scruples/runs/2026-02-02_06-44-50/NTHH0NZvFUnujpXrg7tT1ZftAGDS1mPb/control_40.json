A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about scheduling a boyfriend with a male masseuse when he's uncomfortable with it. The boyfriend says massages are inherently sexual, and the author thinks they're just therapeutic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author booked her boyfriend with a male masseuse, thinking it's a standard service. But he's upset because he perceives it as sexual. The key points here are consent and respecting boundaries. Even if the author thinks her reasoning is logical, if her partner is uncomfortable, she should respect that. \n\nHowever, the author tried to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch. The boyfriend then reacted by wanting to cancel, which might be a bit over the top. But the main issue is whether the author was wrong to book him with a male masseuse without considering his discomfort. \n\nMassages can be a personal space. Some people might feel exposed or uncomfortable with someone of the opposite sex, especially if they see it as crossing into intimate territory. The author might not have intended to make it sexual, but forcing someone into a situation they're not comfortable with, even if it's for a shared activity, could be seen as disregarding their feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's argument that massages are inherently sexual might be a personal belief. The author's approach was to discuss and understand, which is good, but the act of scheduling without prior discussion (assuming he's okay with it) might be where she went wrong. \n\nSo, was she in the wrong? Possibly. She should have discussed it before booking. But she did try to resolve it. However, the initial decision to book without considering his possible discomfort might tip it towards her being at fault. But the boyfriend's reaction is also a bit extreme. \n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is wrong. Since she scheduled it without checking his comfort level, even though she tried to fix it, the initial action was maybe inconsiderate. So answer A (yes, she's in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nWait, the boyfriend's belief is that massages are sexual, which is his own perspective. The author's argument is that they're therapeutic. But the key here is consent. If the boyfriend didn't agree, then the author shouldn't have scheduled him without his input. Even if she had good intentions, not respecting his boundaries is wrong. So the answer might be A. But some might argue it's B because it's a personal choice. \n\nBut in relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is important. So if the author didn't check with him first, she's at fault. Therefore, A is the answer.\n"
