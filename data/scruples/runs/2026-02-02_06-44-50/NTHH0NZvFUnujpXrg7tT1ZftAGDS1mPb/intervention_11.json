  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple booking massages together, and the girlfriend chose a male masseuse for her boyfriend and a female for herself. The boyfriend is uncomfortable with the male masseuse, saying massages are inherently sexual. They argue, he wants to cancel, and she goes without him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that massages are therapeutic and she wanted to understand his discomfort. The boyfriend feels it's sexual and doesn't want to be massaged by a man. He also accuses her of making it up to argue. She offered to switch, but he refused. \n\nNow, the question is if she's in the wrong. From a relationship standpoint, respecting each other's boundaries is important. The boyfriend has a clear discomfort, which he communicated. The author tried to understand but perhaps pushed too hard, turning it into an argument. She might have ignored his feelings by not backing down even after he wanted to cancel. \n\nBut on the other hand, he might be overreacting. Massages are a service, and while some people might feel they have a sexual connotation, others don't. She might be trying to engage in a discussion to resolve the issue. However, when he says he's uncomfortable, she should acknowledge that and not push further. Offering to switch shows she tried to accommodate, but if he's firm, maybe she should accept that. \n\nThe key points are: Did she respect his boundaries? Initially, she tried to switch, but when he refused, she insisted on going without him. That might be her being inconsiderate once he's made his stance clear. He's in a monogamous relationship, so maybe his issue is more about personal insecurity, but that's his issue. The author shouldn't force him to go through something he's uncomfortable with. \n\nAlternatively, she could have been trying to have a discussion to understand his perspective, which is healthy. But if he's not open to discussion and just wants her to stop, then she's overstepping. The fact that he wanted to cancel and she went anyway might show she didn't take his feelings seriously. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (Yes, she's in the wrong) because she didn't respect his final decision to cancel, even after he made it clear he was uncomfortable. But maybe there's a middle ground where she tried to switch, and he refused, so she went without him, which could be seen as a compromise. But the argument part might have been unnecessary.\n\nHmm. The boyfriend's reaction is a bit confusing. If he's in a monogamous relationship, why is he uncomfortable with a massage from a man? That might be a personal insecurity, but that's not her fault. She might not be in the wrong for making a choice that he later regrets. But after he says he's uncomfortable, she should stop pushing and respect his decision. The fact that she kept trying to debate and then went without him might not be the issue as much as the initial decision. But since he had the option to choose, maybe she overstepped by not letting him choose from the start.\n\nWait, she scheduled him with a male masseuse. In a situation where both parties are supposed to agree on the choice, maybe she shouldn't have made the decision unilaterally. So she's in the wrong for not checking with him first. But if she assumed it's okay, maybe that's a different scenario. However, since the boyfriend has a clear issue, she should have discussed it before booking. The problem is, she didn't consider his potential discomfort and made the choice without his input. So yes, she's in the wrong for not involving him in the decision. Then, even after he expressed discomfort, she tried to debate instead of respecting his boundaries. So the answer is A.\n"
