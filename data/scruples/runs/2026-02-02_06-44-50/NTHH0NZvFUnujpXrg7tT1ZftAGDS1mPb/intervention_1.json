  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about scheduling a male masseuse for her boyfriend, who then gets upset and says massages are sexual. The author thinks they're just therapeutic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author didn't consider her boyfriend's feelings and made a choice that he found uncomfortable. She might have thought it was a good idea, but if he's uncomfortable, that's a problem. On the other hand, he might be overreacting, thinking massages are inherently sexual, which could be an issue. But the main point is that she went ahead without considering his preference.\n\nThe boyfriend says it's a problem because he's uncomfortable with a male masseuse. The author tried to understand his reasoning and offered to switch, but he refused and wanted to cancel. The author then went ahead without him. \n\nSo, the key question is whether she should have asked first or considered his feelings before booking. Since she scheduled it without checking with him, she might be at fault for not respecting his boundaries. Even if her intention was neutral, not discussing it first could be seen as dismissive of his feelings. \n\nHowever, maybe he's being overly sensitive. But the fact remains that she made a decision without considering his comfort level. In relationships, communication and respecting each other's preferences are important. So, even if he's being irrational, she should have checked with him first. Therefore, she might be in the wrong for not doing that.\n"
