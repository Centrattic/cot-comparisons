A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation is that they both planned to get massages together. The author, a woman, chose a male masseuse for her boyfriend and a female for herself. The boyfriend didn't like that and said massages are inherently sexual, so he's uncomfortable with a male masseuse. He also says the author is wrong for pushing the issue and making it an argument, even though she tried to understand his reasoning and offered to switch. He ended up saying to cancel his appointment.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to make a plan for both of them to get massages. She split them by gender, maybe assuming that was the natural way. But the boyfriend has a different view, thinking massages have sexual connotations, so he's not comfortable with a male masseuse. \n\nThe author tried to engage in a discussion to understand his reasoning, which is a good approach. She even offered to switch, showing she's willing to accommodate his comfort. But he still refused and suggested canceling. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, she made a decision based on her own understanding and tried to adjust when conflict arose. The boyfriend's issue is about personal boundaries and how he perceives massages. The author didn't force him to have the male masseuse; she only wanted to proceed with her initial plan before the conflict. However, after his discomfort was expressed, she tried to resolve it. \n\nThe key points are: Did the author overstep by scheduling him with a male masseuse without his explicit consent? Maybe. But she might have assumed it was a joint decision. However, ignoring his clear discomfort later could be an issue. \n\nBut she attempted to resolve it by offering to switch. His reaction was to cancel, which is his choice. The author then went ahead without him. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because she tried to understand and adjust. The boyfriend's discomfort is valid, but the author's actions were not malicious. She didn't force him, and she made an effort to resolve it. The main problem is the boyfriend's reaction, not the author's initial decision.\n"
