A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about scheduling a massage for her boyfriend with a male masseuse, and he's upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author booked her boyfriend with a male masseuse, thinking it's a neutral, therapeutic service. Her boyfriend is uncomfortable because he sees massages as inherently sexual. He's upset and wants to cancel. The author tried to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch, but he refuses.\n\nNow, the key points here are autonomy and consent. The boyfriend is expressing his personal boundaries and discomfort. Even if the author doesn't share his view, respecting his feelings is important. The issue is whether the author overstepped by making the booking without considering his preferences.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems extreme, but his discomfort is valid. The author could have consulted him first instead of assuming. She did try to communicate and offer a solution, which shows she's trying to resolve it. However, the initial decision to book without his input might be the problem. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author's intention was to plan a joint activity, but she might have overlooked his specific needs. While she's not wrong for wanting to understand his perspective, forcing a situation where he's uncomfortable could be seen as dismissive of his boundaries.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether respecting his autonomy is more important than the author's intent. Since he's clearly uncomfortable and expressed it, the author should have considered his feelings beforehand. Thus, the author might be in the wrong for not checking in with him first.\n"
