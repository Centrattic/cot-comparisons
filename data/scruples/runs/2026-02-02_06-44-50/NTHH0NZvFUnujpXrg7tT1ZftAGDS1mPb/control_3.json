A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for booking her boyfriend with a male masseuse. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple planned to get massages together. The author, a 21-year-old female, booked her boyfriend (also 21, male) with a male masseuse and herself with a female one. When she tells him, he's upset because he says massages are inherently sexual, and he won't let a man massage him. She thinks massages are therapeutic and tries to understand his reasoning. He gets defensive, calls her opinions irrational, and even suggests canceling the appointment. She insists on going without him.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author made a choice based on available options, maybe thinking she's splitting the genders so each has a same-sex masseuse. But the boyfriend has a strong objection, considering massages as sexual. He's uncomfortable with a male masseuse, so she offered to switch, but he refused and wants to cancel. The author, however, proceeds without him.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she tried to accommodate by offering to switch. The boyfriend's discomfort seems personal and possibly based on his own beliefs. Since he's not willing to compromise, the author's choice to go ahead without him might not be wrong. She didn't force him; she tried to be flexible. However, she did make the decision without his input. But given that he's adamantly against it, maybe she overstepped by not checking with him first. But in many relationships, making such a decision might be okay if it's a non-sensitive topic. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is part of the issue. He's using the argument that massages are sexual, which some might not agree with. But if he's uncomfortable, the author should respect that. However, she did offer to switch, so she's trying to accommodate. The fact that he's unwilling to go at all might be his own problem. The author's intention was to plan a shared activity, and when he refuses, she's going anyway. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Probably not. She tried to be considerate, made a decision, and then offered solutions. The boyfriend's inflexibility is the main problem here. The author's actions don't seem malicious. She wanted to understand his reasoning, so she's not just being dismissive. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
