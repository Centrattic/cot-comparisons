A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote this (the author) is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a woman in a relationship with her boyfriend. They planned to get massages together. When booking, she assigned the male masseuse to her boyfriend and the female one to herself. The boyfriend is upset, saying he won't let a male masseuse touch him because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author thinks massages are therapeutic, tries to understand his reasoning, but he dismisses her as irrational and accuses her of making it up to argue. She offers to switch masseuses, but he says to cancel and refuses to go. She ends up going without him.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about consent and respecting each other's boundaries. The author made a choice for her partner without asking him first. Even if she had the intention to split the masseuses by gender, assuming his comfort with a male masseuse might be an oversight. The boyfriend clearly has a discomfort with male masseuses due to his belief that massages are sexual. His reaction seems to be about personal boundaries and past experiences or beliefs that make him uncomfortable with the opposite gender in a massage setting. The author tried to engage in a discussion, but he shut down the conversation, which complicates things.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, she didn't consider her boyfriend's possible discomfort and made a decision for him. That could be seen as not respecting his autonomy. On the other hand, the boyfriend's reasoning might be based on personal beliefs that he didn't communicate clearly beforehand. However, once he expressed his discomfort, the author did try to adjust (offered to switch), but he refused to compromise and even wanted to cancel the appointment, which is a strong reaction.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might have assumed that since they were getting massages together, splitting by gender was logical, but she didn't check with him first. That's a mistake because everyone has different comfort levels. His response was harsh and dismissive, but the initial act of not consulting him might be where the fault lies. So the author is partly to blame for not asking his preference. But the boyfriend's reaction is also problematic because he's not open to discussion. However, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she made a decision without consent, even if with good intentions, that's an issue. So maybe answer A.\n"
