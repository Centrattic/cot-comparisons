  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a couple booking massages together, and the woman scheduled her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The boyfriend is upset, saying he won't accept a male masseuse because he thinks massages are sexual. The woman thinks massages are therapeutic and is trying to understand his reasoning. He accuses her of making it up to argue and says she's wrong for pushing his discomfort. She offered to switch, but he just wants to cancel his appointments.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author (the woman) is in the wrong. She made a decision to assign the male masseuse to her boyfriend without consulting him first. Even though she intended to discuss it, she didn't consider his possible discomfort upfront. Massages can be a sensitive topic because of their physical nature, and personal boundaries vary. The boyfriend has clear boundaries here, and the woman didn't check in with him before booking. That seems like a mistake in communication.\n\nHowever, she tried to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch, which shows she was trying to resolve the issue. But the key point is that she made the decision without his input. In relationships, especially when it comes to personal comfort levels, communication is crucial. The boyfriend's reaction might be strong, but his argument that massages are inherently sexual might be more about his personal discomfort rather than a universal truth. The woman's approach was to debate the nature of massages, which might come off as dismissive of his feelings. Instead of focusing on the debate, she could have prioritized respecting his boundaries from the start.\n\nSo, while the boyfriend's reaction might be a bit over the top, the woman's initial decision to book without consulting him could be seen as the main issue here. She assumed her choice was neutral, but it turned into a conflict because she didn't consider his perspective first. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting his boundaries upfront.\n"
