He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for booking her boyfriend with a male masseuse. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and her boyfriend planned to get massages together. They had the option of either a male or female masseuse. The author decided to book the boyfriend with the male masseuse and herself with the female. Then, when she told him, he was upset because he said massages are inherently sexual, and he won't let a man do it. He thinks the author is wrong for pushing this and making it an argument. She tried to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch, but he wanted to cancel. The author is going without him.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong? Let's look at both sides. The author's intention was probably to share the experience together, maybe as a couples' thing. She might have thought it's okay since they both get massages, just with different genders. But the boyfriend is uncomfortable because he sees it as sexual. He's in a monogamous relationship, so maybe he feels it's a breach of trust, even though it's just a massage. He's not being physical with the masseuse, but his discomfort is about the inherent sexuality he associates with it. He says she's making it up to argue, which seems dismissive of her intentions. \n\nThe author tried to explain her stance, saw his reasoning, and offered to switch. That shows she's being considerate. He refuses and wants to cancel. She sticks to her plan but maybe doesn't consider his feelings enough? Or is she standing her ground for something reasonable? \n\nMassages can be a sensitive topic. Some people feel it's therapeutic and others see it as potentially sexual. The boyfriend's discomfort is valid, even if the author doesn't agree. However, the author didn't force him; she offered to switch, but he didn't accept. So she's trying to accommodate. \n\nHe might be wrong in his reasoning, but the fact that he's uncomfortable is his personal issue. The author isn't making it sexual; she's just scheduling. So maybe she's not in the wrong because she's respecting his initial choice by offering to switch but he's not taking that up. \n\nAlternatively, maybe she should have considered his feelings more upfront. But she did, right? She tried to discuss it. He's being rigid by not switching. \n\nSo overall, the author's actions seem reasonable. She's trying to find a solution. The boyfriend is being inflexible. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
