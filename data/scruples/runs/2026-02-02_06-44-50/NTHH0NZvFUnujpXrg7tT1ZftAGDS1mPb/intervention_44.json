A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for scheduling their boyfriend with a male masseuse. The boyfriend gets upset, says massages are inherently sexual, and refuses to go. The author tried to discuss and understand his reasoning, offered to switch, but he insists on canceling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author wanted to book the massages together, which is a common activity. They chose the available options, male and female, which might not be an issue if they were separate. But the boyfriend has a strong objection based on his belief that massages are sexual. \n\nIs it the author's fault for choosing the male masseuse? Well, they might not have known his preference beforehand. It's possible they thought it was a neutral choice since both options were available. The boyfriend's reaction seems to stem from his personal discomfort, which might not be the author's responsibility unless they were aware of it. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have asked the boyfriend's preference before booking. Maybe they didn't consider that aspect, leading to the conflict. But the boyfriend's reaction is also over the top\u2014he's canceling the entire thing and calling her argument irrational. The author tried to understand and compromise by offering to switch, which shows they aren't being unreasonable. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions were inconsiderate. If the author didn't know about the boyfriend's feelings beforehand, it's not their fault. However, if they ignored his boundaries after the fact, that's different. But in this case, the author did make an effort to resolve the issue, so it's more about the boyfriend's inflexibility. \n\nSo, I think the author isn't in the wrong because they made a choice based on available options and tried to accommodate the boyfriend's feelings afterwards. The fault might lie more with the boyfriend for being inflexible and not communicating his preferences earlier.\n"
