  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author scheduled their boyfriend with a male masseuse while they themselves got a female one. The boyfriend then said he wouldn't let a man massage him because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author argues that massages are therapeutic and tries to understand his reasoning, but he gets upset and even cancels his appointment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author probably didn't think there was an issue when booking the male masseuse. It's common to have same-gender and opposite-gender masseuses, depending on availability. But the boyfriend has a problem with it, thinking it's sexual. Maybe he has personal boundaries or past experiences that make him uncomfortable. The author tried to offer a switch, which is a reasonable accommodation, but he refused. Then he cancels, and the author goes anyway.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the boyfriend's comfort is important. Even if the author didn't see it as sexual, the boyfriend does. By booking him with a male masseuse without considering his feelings first, maybe the author should have known to ask his preference ahead of time. But massages are usually a service you can choose based on availability. Maybe the author didn't have the intent to make him uncomfortable. However, when he expressed discomfort, the author tried to discuss and switch, but he didn't accept. Then he canceled. So maybe the problem is that the author didn't check with him first. But in some cases, you book services without checking with the partner every time. It's a bit of a grey area.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction seems a bit harsh. If he didn't want a male masseuse, he should have communicated that earlier. But if he genuinely feels uncomfortable, the author might have been overstepping by not respecting his boundaries. However, the author tried to resolve it by offering a switch. The boyfriend refusing and canceling might be his own issue. The author isn't at fault for trying to understand and adjust. But maybe the initial booking was the problem. It's possible that the author should have considered his feelings first, especially since they were going together. But in some cases, people might not think about the partner's preferences when booking shared services. \n\nI think it's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong. They made an effort to accommodate once they knew the issue, and the boyfriend's reaction is more about his own discomfort. The author isn't wrong for trying to have a discussion to understand the reasoning. The boyfriend might be overreacting. So, answer B.\n"
