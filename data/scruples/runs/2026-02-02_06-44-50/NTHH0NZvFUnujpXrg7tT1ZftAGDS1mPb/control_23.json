  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation involves a disagreement about the nature of massages\u2014whether they're purely therapeutic or have a sexual connotation. The boyfriend refuses to have a male masseuse, saying massages are inherently sexual. The author tries to discuss and understand his reasoning but ends up with him refusing the massage altogether.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's intention was to plan a shared activity, which is common. She chose based on availability, which seems neutral. The boyfriend's discomfort stems from his belief that massages are sexual, which might be a personal or cultural belief. However, in many contexts, massages are considered therapeutic, not sexual. But since the boyfriend is clearly uncomfortable, the author tried to accommodate by offering to switch, but he still refused. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for initially booking based on available options without knowing his preference? Probably not. People have different comfort levels. But by trying to debate the nature of massages, maybe she overstepped. However, she was trying to understand, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's reaction seems extreme, dismissing her argument as irrational and refusing to attend. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is key. The author tried to adjust, but the boyfriend didn't want to proceed at all. The author's choice wasn't malicious, and she made an effort to find a solution. The boyfriend's stance might be personal, but the author isn't obligated to accept his discomfort as absolute. So, she's not in the wrong for making an effort and proceeding without him when he's unwilling to compromise further.\n"
