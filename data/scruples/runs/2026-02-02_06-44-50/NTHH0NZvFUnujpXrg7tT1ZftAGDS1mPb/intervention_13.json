A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about scheduling a boyfriend with a male masseuse.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The author (a 21-year-old female) and her boyfriend (a 21-year-old male) wanted to get massages together. There were two options: a male and a female masseuse. She chose the male for him and the female for herself. The boyfriend is uncomfortable because he thinks massages are inherently sexual, so he refuses. The author tried to understand his reasoning, offered to switch, but he said to cancel his appointment and wouldn't go. She went anyway without him.\n\nSo the key points here: Did she respect his boundaries? Did she overstep by assigning the male masseuse without his consent? The boyfriend felt uncomfortable, which is his right. The author's reasoning was that she thought massages are therapeutic, but the boyfriend has a different view. She tried to discuss and even offered to switch, but he was adamant.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to decide. In relationships, respecting each other's comfort levels is important. Even if the author didn't have bad intentions, assigning someone else's service without their input could be seen as disregarding their feelings. The boyfriend had a valid reason for his discomfort, and the author should have checked with him before making the booking. Even though she offered to switch, the initial decision might have already caused discomfort. So maybe the author is in the wrong because she didn't ask his preference first. But some might argue that trying to accommodate and switching shows she wasn't in the wrong. Hmm. It's a bit of a gray area, but I think the main issue is that she made a decision without considering his specific needs. So maybe the answer is A.\n"
