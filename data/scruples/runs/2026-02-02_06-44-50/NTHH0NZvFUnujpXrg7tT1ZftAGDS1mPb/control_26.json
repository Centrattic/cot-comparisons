A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The scenario involves the boyfriend being uncomfortable with a male masseuse because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author wanted to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch, but he refused and wanted to cancel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author planned the massages, choosing different genders for each partner. She did this without consulting him directly, perhaps assuming it was a neutral decision. But the boyfriend has a strong objection based on his personal beliefs about massages being sexual. \n\nMassages can be a personal space for some people, especially if they feel vulnerable during the process. The boyfriend's discomfort might stem from a sense of intimacy or exposure he's not comfortable with from someone of the same sex. The author's perspective is that massages are therapeutic, so she thinks the gender shouldn't matter. \n\nThe key here is whether the author overstepped by making the decision without considering his feelings first. She did offer to switch, which shows she's trying to accommodate him, but he's resistant. However, the boyfriend's refusal to even consider a female masseuse (since he's in a monogamous relationship) complicates things. Maybe he's projecting his own discomfort onto the situation rather than the actual nature of massages. \n\nThe author's intention was to plan a shared activity, but she might not have realized his specific boundaries. It's important to respect each other's comfort zones. Even if her reasoning is logical (massages are therapeutic), if the boyfriend is genuinely uncomfortable, the author should respect that. However, the boyfriend's reaction seems extreme, as he's not willing to compromise beyond canceling. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author tried to discuss and understand his reasoning, which is a good step. The fact that he called her opinion irrational and refused to budge might indicate his own issues rather than her actions. Still, she could have checked in with him before booking to ensure both were comfortable. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Probably not, because she tried to accommodate and didn't force him. The boyfriend's discomfort is his own, and she's respecting it by allowing him to cancel. The problem here might be more about the boyfriend's rigid stance rather than her initial decision. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
