A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's see.\n\nThe situation is that the author, who is a woman, scheduled her boyfriend with a male masseuse and herself with a female. The boyfriend then says he won't accept a male masseuse because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author tried to discuss and understand his reasoning, but he dismissed her as irrational and even suggested canceling the massages. The author is going ahead without him.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: She made the booking, assuming he's okay with a male masseuse. But maybe she should have checked with him first? If she had asked him which masseuse he preferred, that might have prevented the issue. But she might have thought it was a neutral choice, like splitting the available options. However, the boyfriend has a strong objection, so perhaps she should have considered his comfort level.\n\nThen, when the boyfriend objects, the author tries to debate and understand. But he's not open to discussion. She's trying to rationalize it, but he's not engaging. She even offered to switch, but he wants to cancel. The boyfriend might feel that her insistence on debating is making a big deal out of his discomfort, which he finds important. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that she's being reasonable and wants to understand his perspective. But if he's uncomfortable with a male masseuse, maybe she should respect that without pushing the debate. The key here is whether her actions were inconsiderate of his feelings. \n\nThe boyfriend's reasoning that massages are sexual might be a personal belief, but in a relationship, partners should respect each other's boundaries. The author's decision to proceed without him might be seen as not acknowledging his discomfort. However, she might argue that it's a personal choice to get a massage and she shouldn't have to cancel just because of his issue. \n\nI think the main point is about communication and respect. The author didn't check his preference before booking, which could be seen as inconsiderate. Also, when he expressed discomfort, she pushed the debate instead of respecting his feelings. So maybe the author is partly in the wrong. But then again, the boyfriend's reaction is also extreme. \n\nBut since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, I have to consider if her initial action and her response were appropriate. She might have overstepped by not consulting him first and then not backing down when he was uncomfortable. So maybe the answer is A, she's in the wrong. But I'm a bit conflicted because the boyfriend's reaction is also an issue. However, the user is asking specifically about the author's actions. So yes, A."
