A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for booking her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation involves both parties getting massages together, and the author made the decision to assign genders to each partner. The boyfriend is uncomfortable with a male masseuse, citing that massages are inherently sexual. The author tries to understand his reasoning and even offers to switch masseuses, but he insists on canceling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author's action was based on her own reasoning, perhaps assuming that splitting by gender would be neutral. However, the boyfriend has a clear discomfort rooted in his belief about massages being sexual. The author tried to engage in a discussion, which is a good approach, and offered a compromise. The conflict arose when the boyfriend refused to switch and instead wanted to cancel, leaving the author to go alone.\n\nThe key here is whether the author overstepped by making the decision without consulting him first. Even though she may have thought she was being considerate by splitting by gender, not checking in with him about his preferences could be seen as dismissive. However, once the issue came up, she did try to accommodate his feelings. The boyfriend's response seems to be the more rigid one, as he's unwilling to compromise beyond canceling.\n\nBut the question is about the author's fault. Did she have a duty to consult him before booking? In relationships, shared activities often require mutual discussion. Even if her intention was good, making the decision unilaterally might have been the mistake. However, the fact that she tried to address his concerns afterward could mitigate some blame. Alternatively, maybe the boyfriend's reaction is overly sensitive, especially since he's in a monogamous relationship. The author's attempt to understand his logic shows she's trying to be empathetic.\n\nSo, is the author at fault? If she made the decision without considering his preferences, even if briefly, that's an issue. But if she had no way of knowing his discomfort beforehand, maybe not. The boyfriend's refusal to switch and insistence on canceling also plays a role. The author's position is that she wanted to understand and compromise, which is fair. The boyfriend's stance might be more problematic.\n\nBut the initial action of booking without checking in could be seen as the fault. In relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is key. Even if the author thought it was a neutral choice, not confirming with him first might have been the mistake. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility.\n"
