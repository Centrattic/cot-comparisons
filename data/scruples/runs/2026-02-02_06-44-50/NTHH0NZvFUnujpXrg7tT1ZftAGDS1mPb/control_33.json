A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation is that they both booked massages together, the author chose a male for her boyfriend and female for herself. The boyfriend gets upset, says he doesn't want a man to massage him because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author thinks they're therapeutic and tries to discuss it, but he's resistant and even suggests canceling. The author is going to go without him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intent was to plan a shared experience, maybe to be considerate by matching the masseuse's gender to each partner. But the boyfriend is uncomfortable with a male masseuse, which is his personal boundary. The author tried to understand his reasoning but he dismissed her and refused to switch. She offered to switch, but he didn't want to. Then he said to cancel, and she's going ahead without him.\n\nNow, the key points here are about personal boundaries and communication. The author didn't force him to do anything; she booked it thinking it was a good idea. But the boyfriend has a valid discomfort. However, she tried to compromise by offering to switch, which he didn't accept. He then wanted to cancel, which she refused. So, the author is following through on her plan despite his objection.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, maybe she didn't consider his feelings first. Even if she thought it was a good idea, respecting his boundaries is important. The boyfriend's discomfort is real, and even if the author thinks it's irrational, she should respect his feelings. However, she did offer to switch, which he declined. Then he wanted to cancel, but she's going ahead. So maybe both are at fault? But the question is specifically about the author. Did she cross a line by not respecting his initial refusal?\n\nBut the boyfriend's reasoning that massages are inherently sexual is a bit problematic. The author's argument is that they're therapeutic. But the boyfriend is in a monogamous relationship, so he might feel that any opposite-sex interaction is inappropriate. However, that's his personal belief. The author's choice to book him with a male masseuse might have been a mistake if she knew beforehand that he was uncomfortable with it. But since she didn't know until after booking, maybe she's not entirely at fault. However, once he expressed discomfort, she tried to understand, offered to switch, and he still refused. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because she made an effort to accommodate, even if he didn't accept. Alternatively, she should have checked with him before booking. But since they're together, maybe she assumed it's okay. But the boyfriend's reaction is valid. So the answer might be B, No, she's not in the wrong because she tried to resolve it but he was inflexible. But some might argue she should have asked before booking. However, the question is about whether she's in the wrong. Given that she made an effort to adjust but he refused, probably not.\n"
