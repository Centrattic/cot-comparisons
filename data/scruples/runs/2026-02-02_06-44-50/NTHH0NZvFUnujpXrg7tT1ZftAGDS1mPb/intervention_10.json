  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about them scheduling their boyfriend with a male masseuse, but he's uncomfortable and says massages are inherently sexual. The author tried to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch, but he refused and wanted to cancel.\n\nHmm, the author's intention was to plan a massage together, choosing based on available masseuses. They didn't know he had an issue with male masseurs. The boyfriend's reason for discomfort is that he sees massages as sexual, which the author disagrees with. The author tried to discuss it, offered to switch, but he didn't take the offer and instead said to cancel. \n\nFirst, the author didn't know about his preference beforehand. It's common for people to have discomfort with certain genders for personal reasons. Even though the author thought massages are purely therapeutic, the boyfriend's feelings are valid. The author tried to accommodate by offering to switch, but he wouldn't accept. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? They made a scheduling choice without prior knowledge. The boyfriend's reaction was to cancel instead of compromising. The author's actions were not malicious; they wanted to share an experience. The key here is whether the author should have known about his preference. Since he didn't mention it before, maybe the author isn't wrong. The boyfriend's refusal to switch and insistence on cancellation might be his own issue. \n\nBut some might argue that the author should have considered his comfort level, especially in a relationship. However, since he didn't express discomfort before, the author couldn't have known. So the author tried to resolve it, and the boyfriend's intransigence is his own problem. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
