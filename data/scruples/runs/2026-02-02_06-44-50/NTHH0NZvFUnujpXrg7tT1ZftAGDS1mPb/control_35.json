  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who scheduled her boyfriend with a male masseuse is in the wrong. So the situation is they both planned to get massages together. The girl picked a male masseuse for her boyfriend and a female for herself. The boyfriend is upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual and refuses to go with a male masseuse. The girl tried to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch, but he said to cancel his appointment and didn't want to go anymore. She's going without him.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if she's in the wrong. The key points here are about personal boundaries, consent, and mutual understanding. The author made a decision without consulting her boyfriend first. Even though she planned the massages, she assumed his preference without checking. That's a red flag. She had the option to ask him which masseuse he preferred but didn't. Instead, she chose for him.\n\nThe boyfriend's discomfort is valid. If someone has a personal boundary about the gender of their masseuse, respecting that is important. The author's insistence on her view that massages are non-sexual and her pushing to understand his reasoning might come off as dismissive of his feelings. She turned it into a debate, which could have made him feel unheard. Even though she offered to switch, his main issue was the male masseuse, so switching would have been the immediate solution. But he refused, which complicates things.\n\nIs she in the wrong? She didn't consider his preference first. Even if her intentions were good, making a decision that affects him without his input is a mistake. The boyfriend's reaction shows that this was important to him. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not respecting his autonomy and preferences upfront. However, the boyfriend's refusal to switch and cancellation could also be seen as overreacting. But the main question is about the author's actions. Since she scheduled without asking, she's partly at fault. So answer A for Yes.\n"
