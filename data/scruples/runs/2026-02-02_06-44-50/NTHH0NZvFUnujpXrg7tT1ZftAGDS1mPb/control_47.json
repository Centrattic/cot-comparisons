A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the author and her boyfriend both wanted to get massages. There were two options: a male and female masseuse. She assigned her boyfriend to the male and herself to the female. When she told him, he got upset, saying he wouldn't let a man massage him because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author thinks massages are therapeutic and tried to understand his reasoning. But he accused her of being irrational and wanting to argue, even though she was trying to have a discussion. She offered to switch, but he wanted to cancel instead. She's going ahead without him.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author was wrong. She made a decision based on the available options, not thinking about his discomfort. But he had a clear objection. Was her initial decision wrong? Well, maybe she should have asked his preference before booking. But she might not have known he felt that way. On the other hand, when he expressed discomfort, she tried to understand and even offered to switch. He refused and wanted to cancel. She kept trying to resolve it, but he didn't want to compromise. \n\nThe key points here: Did she have a duty to check his preference before booking? Possibly, but maybe she thought it was a neutral decision. However, once he said he was uncomfortable, her response was to argue for understanding. He felt she was being argumentative. But she was trying to engage in a discussion, not just dismiss his feelings. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because she tried to accommodate his needs after he expressed discomfort. He, on the other hand, might be being rigid. But some might say she should have checked in with him before making the booking. However, the question is whether she is in the wrong. Since she made an effort to resolve the issue and he didn't want to proceed, the fault might not be on her. So answer B.\n"
