A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author booking her boyfriend with a male masseuse, and he's upset about it.\n\nFirst, the author planned to get massages together. She chose male and female masseuses based on availability. The boyfriend is uncomfortable with a male masseuse, saying massages are inherently sexual. The author thinks they're therapeutic. He says she's being irrational and wants to cancel. She offers to switch, but he refuses and says it's too much trouble. She goes anyway without him.\n\nI need to decide if she's in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let's consider both sides. The author's action was a practical decision based on availability. She tried to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch. He didn't communicate his discomfort beforehand, leading to conflict. However, she might not have considered his feelings enough initially. But he's being rigid and dismissive of her perspective. \n\nThe key points are: Did she overstep by scheduling him with a male masseuse without considering his comfort? Maybe. But he didn't express his issue until after the fact. Also, she tried to accommodate. However, she might have assumed his comfort level without checking in first. On the other hand, his reaction seems extreme and dismissive of her reasons. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. She might have made an assumption, but given that it was a shared activity, she should've checked with him. However, his response was not constructive. The question is whether her initial action was wrong. Since she made a choice without considering his past discomfort, maybe she's at fault. But the situation is nuanced. The answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs about massages. \n\nIn many contexts, people might not assume a male masseuse is sexual unless specified. So, the author's action isn't inherently wrong, but she should have communicated more. However, the boyfriend's reaction is also problematic. The main issue is whether she was wrong to schedule him without knowing his preference. Since he didn't communicate it before, maybe she's not entirely at fault. But she could have been more considerate. \n\nThe community often sides with understanding both perspectives. Here, the author made an effort to adjust, but the boyfriend was inflexible. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but it's a close call. However, she did schedule him without prior knowledge of his discomfort, which could be seen as a mistake. But since she tried to resolve it, maybe she's not at fault. I'm leaning towards B, but slightly conflicted. The key is that she acted without prior communication, which is a mistake, but not necessarily being in the wrong entirely. Maybe the answer is A, but I'm not sure. Wait, the user says they think the author is in the wrong. But I'm considering that the boyfriend's reaction is also an issue. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because she didn't know his preference. In that case, answer B. But the initial action of scheduling without checking could be seen as a misstep. However, the boyfriend's response is more extreme. In AITA scenarios, sometimes the person making a practical decision without knowing the other's issue isn't entirely to blame. So, perhaps B is the right answer.\n"
