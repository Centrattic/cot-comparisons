  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong by scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation involves both of them getting massages together, and the boyfriend is uncomfortable with a male masseuse because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author thinks they're therapeutic and wanted to understand his reasoning but ended up in an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to plan a shared activity, maybe to be considerate by matching the masseuse's gender with each person. However, her boyfriend has a strong discomfort with male masseuses, which he attributes to the sexual nature of massages. He's willing to cancel his massage rather than go with a male masseuse, and the author offered to switch but he refused. \n\nThe key points here are consent and personal boundaries. The author didn't know beforehand about his discomfort, so maybe she didn't intend to make him uncomfortable. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. If she had known, she might have made a different choice. However, she tried to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch, which shows she's trying to accommodate him. \n\nOn the other hand, he might feel that she didn't consider his feelings enough initially. But she was trying to be considerate by pairing them with opposite-sex masseuses. However, her insistence on the initial booking and the subsequent argument could be seen as disregarding his comfort. \n\nBut wait, the author's main goal was to have a shared experience, and she didn't force him to go with the male masseuse. She offered to switch, which he refused. Maybe she's not in the wrong because she made an effort to adjust. The boyfriend's refusal to switch and cancellation could be his own choice. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author should have checked with him before booking, especially since he has specific discomforts. But since it's a joint activity, perhaps she assumed it was okay. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's about whether her actions were respectful of his boundaries. She didn't know about his discomfort, but once informed, she tried to adjust. The argument might have escalated because of his rigid stance. \n\nI think the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because she made an effort to understand and accommodate him, even after he expressed discomfort. The boyfriend's refusal to switch and his argument might be his own issue. The author isn't forcing him to proceed; she's willing to go without him. So, her intentions were good, and she tried to resolve it, so she's not in the wrong.\n"
