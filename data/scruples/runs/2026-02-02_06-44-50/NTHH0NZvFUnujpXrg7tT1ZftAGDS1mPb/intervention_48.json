  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for booking her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The boyfriend got upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual and he's uncomfortable with a male masseuse. The author wanted to understand his reasoning and offered to switch, but he refused and said to cancel his appointment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author didn't know her boyfriend's preference beforehand. She chose based on availability, maybe assuming it's a matter of convenience. But the boyfriend has a strong opinion, which he explained. He feels massages have a sexual connotation, so a male masseuse is out of the question for him. \n\nThe author tried to engage in a discussion to understand his perspective, which shows she's trying to be considerate. She even offered to switch, which is a reasonable compromise. However, he refused and wanted to cancel. The question is whether her initial decision was wrong despite her efforts to resolve it.\n\nMassages can be a sensitive topic. Some people might feel uncomfortable with the opposite or same sex, depending on cultural or personal beliefs. The author's intention was to plan a joint activity, but not considering the boyfriend's specific comfort level could be seen as an oversight. However, she didn't know beforehand, and the boyfriend's stance seems a bit rigid. \n\nHe says massages are inherently sexual, which might imply he's okay with his partner getting a massage from someone else, but himself not. That could be a point of contention. The author's approach was to understand and adjust, but he was inflexible. \n\nSo, was the author wrong? She made a choice without knowing his preference, but after discussing, she tried to adapt. The boyfriend's reaction might be over the top, but she could have been more considerate from the start. Maybe she should have checked with him before booking, but given that he didn't mention it before, it's hard to read his mind. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author tried to communicate, but maybe the initial booking could have been a misstep. However, her effort to resolve the issue shows she's not entirely wrong. The boyfriend's refusal to switch might be more rigid. \n\nHmm. This is tough. I think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because she tried to address it, but maybe she could have been more proactive in checking his preferences. But given that he didn't express discomfort until after the booking, it's a bit ambiguous. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because she made an effort to resolve the issue once it came up. The boyfriend's stance might be the bigger issue here. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
