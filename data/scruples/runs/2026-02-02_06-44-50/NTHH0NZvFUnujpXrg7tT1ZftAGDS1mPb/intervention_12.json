A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author, a woman, booked massages for her and her boyfriend. She scheduled him with a male masseuse and herself with a female one. The boyfriend then objected, saying he wouldn't let a man massage him because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. She tried to discuss it, thinking they're therapeutic, but he got defensive, called her irrational, and even said he'd cancel his massages. She stuck with her decision and went anyway.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to plan a shared activity, maybe for relaxation. She split the bookings based on available options. But the boyfriend's discomfort is about the gender of the masseuse. He feels massages have a sexual connotation, even though they're in a monogamous relationship. The author is confused and tries to debate the point, but he sees it as her pushing his boundaries.\n\nNow, the key points here. The boyfriend had no prior mention of discomfort with male masseuses. The author made the booking without checking his preferences. Even though she offered to switch, he refused and didn't want to proceed. The author's actions led to a conflict, but she stood by her choice. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, she didn't consider his feelings beforehand. The initial decision was made without consulting him, which might have been a mistake. However, massages are generally therapeutic, so her reasoning isn't baseless. But the issue isn't the massage itself, but the gender of the masseuse. The boyfriend's discomfort is personal, possibly rooted in his own beliefs about gender and intimacy. \n\nBut by not checking with him first, she imposed her choice on him. Even if she thought it was a neutral decision, his reaction shows it's a sensitive topic. The fact that he refused to proceed and she went ahead anyway might indicate she prioritized her convenience over his comfort. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's argument that massages are inherently sexual is questionable. In a monogamous relationship, getting a massage from another person of the opposite sex isn't necessarily a problem, but if he's uncomfortable, his feelings are valid. However, his response was dismissive and confrontational, which isn't helpful. \n\nSo, who is at fault here? The author didn't check his preferences, which he found important. She made an assumption that might not align with his boundaries. Even if her intention was good, not discussing it with him first led to conflict. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering his feelings and making the decision unilaterally. The answer would be A, but I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing. \n\nAlternatively, if the boyfriend's reasoning is invalid, maybe the author isn't wrong. But the situation hinges on whether respecting his feelings is more important than the author's reasoning. Since the boyfriend expressed discomfort, even if the author disagrees, respecting his choice would be key in a relationship. So, the author's mistake was not checking in with him before booking. Therefore, answer A.\n"
