  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for booking her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation involves both getting massages together, with the author choosing a male masseuse for her boyfriend and a female one for herself. The boyfriend then objects, saying massages are inherently sexual, and he's uncomfortable with a male masseuse. The author tried to discuss and understand his reasoning but he dismissed her and suggested canceling. She insists on going without him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and comfort. The key issue here is whether the author overstepped by making a decision that affects her boyfriend's comfort. While it's common to book appointments for others, especially in a relationship, it's important to communicate and respect boundaries. The author may have assumed she was doing a favor by booking, but the boyfriend clearly expressed discomfort with a male masseuse. That discomfort was based on his personal belief about massages being sexual, which he's entitled to. \n\nThe author tried to engage in a discussion, which shows she's trying to understand, but the boyfriend felt she was being argumentative. However, the author's intention was to understand, not to argue. The boyfriend's response of canceling seems extreme, but his discomfort is valid. The author's mistake might be not checking in with him before booking, assuming she knew what he wanted. Even if her reasoning was about therapeutic vs. sexual, the fact that he's uncomfortable should have been a red flag to step back.\n\nSo, the author made a decision that impacted her partner's comfort without prior agreement. Even though her intentions were good, prioritizing her own choice over his comfort could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer is A (author is in the wrong), but there's nuance in both parties' perspectives.\n"
