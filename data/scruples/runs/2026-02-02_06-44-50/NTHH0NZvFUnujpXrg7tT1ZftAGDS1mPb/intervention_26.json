  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for booking her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation is that they planned to get massages together, and she chose the male masseuse for him. He got upset, saying massages are inherently sexual and he doesn't want a male masseuse. She thought it was irrational and tried to debate his reasoning. He then said he would cancel his massages and she went ahead without him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author wanted to make a practical choice, maybe thinking it's fair to split the genders since they're getting massages together. But her boyfriend is uncomfortable with a male masseuse, citing that massages are sexual, which might be a personal belief or cultural thing. She tried to understand his reasoning but he felt she was pushing him into an argument. He then refused to go, and she went alone.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she made a decision without fully considering his boundaries first. Even if she thought her choice was rational, his discomfort is valid. By trying to debate his feelings, she might have invalidated his perspective. The key here is whether she should have respected his initial discomfort without trying to debate it. She did offer to switch, but when he didn't accept and wanted to cancel, she went anyway. That shows she prioritized her choice over his comfort. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because she didn't fully respect his boundaries without trying to convince him otherwise. The answer would lean towards A (Yes), but I should check if there's a nuance I'm missing. Maybe the boyfriend is being overly sensitive? But the question is about the author's actions. Even if his view is controversial, the author should respect his feelings. Hence, the answer is A.\n"
