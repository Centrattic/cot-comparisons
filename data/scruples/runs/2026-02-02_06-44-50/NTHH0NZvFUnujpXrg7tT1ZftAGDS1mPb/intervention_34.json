A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this step by step. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author booking a male masseuse for her boyfriend, who then objects because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author tried to discuss and understand his reasoning, offered to switch, but he refused and suggested canceling the appointment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives here. The author's intention was to divide the massages based on gender, which might seem logical or neutral. However, the boyfriend's discomfort stems from his belief that opposite-sex massages have a sexual connotation. This could be due to personal boundaries or past experiences. \n\nThe author tried to engage in a discussion to understand his reasoning, which is a mature approach. She even offered a compromise by suggesting switching masseuses. However, the boyfriend's response was to cancel, which might indicate that he's not open to negotiation. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong to proceed with the male masseuse. It's important to recognize that respecting someone's boundaries is crucial. Even if the author believes massages are purely therapeutic, if the boyfriend feels uncomfortable, her decision could be seen as disregarding his feelings. However, she did attempt to address his concerns and offer solutions. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction might be overly rigid. If he's okay with getting massages from women in general but just not men, maybe his stance is inconsistent. But that's his personal boundary. The author's approach was to seek understanding and compromise, which is positive. However, the initial decision to assign the male masseuse without considering his potential discomfort could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author did communicate after booking, which is good, but perhaps she should have checked with him before making the decision. However, since the options were male and female, splitting them might have seemed like the natural choice. \n\nSo, was she wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. She had good intentions and tried to resolve the issue, but maybe she didn't consider his feelings beforehand. However, the boyfriend's refusal to budge might also be an issue. But the core question is about the author's actions. Since she made an effort to resolve the conflict after the fact, maybe she isn't entirely at fault. But if the boyfriend clearly communicated his discomfort after the booking, perhaps the author should have been more proactive in checking his preferences beforehand. However, in this case, she did offer a solution. Hmm, tricky. Maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because she tried to address it and he was inflexible, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe A because she didn't consider his feelings initially. I'm a bit torn here.\n"
