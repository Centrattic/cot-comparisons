  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple who booked massages together, with the guy getting a male masseuse and the girl a female one. The boyfriend then refuses to go because he thinks massages are inherently sexual and doesn't want a male masseuse. The author (girl) is trying to discuss the reasoning, but he shuts it down and says she's wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider each perspective. The girl thought she was being fair, splitting the genders. The guy has a personal boundary he's uncomfortable crossing. She tried to understand his reasoning, offered to switch, but he still refused. She's going ahead without him, but he's upset she pushed the issue.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she made a choice based on gender for the masseuses, which he didn't like. She tried to discuss, which is good, but he felt she was arguing. Maybe she should have asked his preference before booking? But she might not have known. The key points here are consent and respecting boundaries. Even if she thought massages are therapeutic, if he's uncomfortable, respecting his comfort is important. However, she tried to compromise. The fact that he refused to switch and just wanted to cancel might indicate he's being rigid. But the main issue is whether her initial choice was wrong. Since she didn't know his preference beforehand, maybe not. But maybe she should have discussed it first. However, the story says she tried to understand his reasoning after the fact. It's a bit of a gray area. In terms of right or wrong, maybe she's not in the wrong because she tried to communicate and offer solutions. He had the final say to cancel, but she's not wrong for wanting to proceed. So answer B (No).\n"
