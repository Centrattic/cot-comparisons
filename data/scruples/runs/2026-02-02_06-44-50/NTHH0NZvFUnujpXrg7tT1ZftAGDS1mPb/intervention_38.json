A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nThe author, a 21-year-old female, and her boyfriend planned to get massages together. There were two options: a male and a female masseuse. She booked the male masseuse for her boyfriend (who is also 21, male) and the female for herself. When she told her boyfriend about this, he was upset and said he would never let a male masseuse massage him. He explained that he considers massages inherently sexual. The author tried to discuss it, thinking massages are therapeutic, but he accused her of being irrational and making it up to argue. She offered to switch, but he wanted to cancel. She went ahead without him.\n\nThe user thinks the author might be in the wrong. Let me analyze both sides.\n\nFirst, the author made a decision without her boyfriend's input. Even though there were two options, she assumed which one would be better for him. Maybe she thought it was a neutral choice, but her boyfriend has a strong objection. His discomfort is valid; some people feel massages can be sexualized, especially with the opposite sex. The author pushed to understand his reasoning, which is good, but he felt she was pushing for an argument. She offered to switch, which shows she was willing to compromise, but he still refused. \n\nIs it the author's fault? She might have overstepped by not checking with him first. Even if her intention was good, making a choice without considering his preferences could be seen as dismissive. On the other hand, her intention was to facilitate the plan without conflict, and she did try to adjust. But he was clearly uncomfortable, so her initial action might have been the issue.\n\nAnother angle: the author's reasoning that if massages are sexual, why go at all in a monogamous relationship. That's a logical point, but her boyfriend might have different views. She's trying to debate the logic, but he's not in the mood. Maybe she should have just accepted his discomfort without trying to counter it, but she was trying to understand. However, pushing the discussion might have escalated things.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's main mistake was making the choice without prior discussion. Even if she thought it was a logical choice, her boyfriend's comfort is important. So, AITA? Probably A (the author is in the wrong) because she didn't consider his feelings first. But there's nuance. However, the boyfriend's reaction seems over the top, but the author's action initiated the conflict. So answer A.\n"
