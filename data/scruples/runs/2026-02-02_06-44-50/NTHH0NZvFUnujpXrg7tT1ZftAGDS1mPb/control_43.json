A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for booking their boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation is about a couple planning to get massages together. The user (female) chose a male for her boyfriend and a female for herself. The boyfriend objects because he thinks massages are inherently sexual, so he's uncomfortable with a male masseuse. The author tried to discuss and understand his reasoning, even offered to switch, but he didn't want to change and suggested canceling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's action was to make a choice for her partner without consulting him first. Even though they were going together, maybe she should have asked his preference. On the other hand, the boyfriend's objection is based on his personal discomfort, which is valid. The author tried to engage in a discussion but he shut it down. \n\nIs the author at fault for making the booking? Maybe because she didn't check with him first. But she didn't know his preference before booking. Also, when he expressed discomfort, she offered to switch, showing she was trying to accommodate. The boyfriend's response seems inflexible. However, the author's initial decision might have overlooked his possible discomfort. \n\nThe boyfriend's reasoning about massages being sexual is a bit confusing since he's okay with them in a monogamous relationship. That contradiction might be part of the issue. The author tried to understand but he dismissed her. \n\nSo, the author's actions led to a conflict, but she made an effort to resolve it. The boyfriend's reaction is rigid. In terms of fault, maybe the author is slightly at fault for not confirming his preference first, but it's not a clear cut case. However, since he didn't specify his preference beforehand, perhaps she couldn't have known. The main issue is the boyfriend's discomfort and how he handled it. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is important. The author respected his discomfort once he mentioned it by offering to switch. The initial booking might have been a mistake, but the main conflict arises from his refusal to adjust. However, the fact that she made the choice without his input could be seen as the initial error. But considering the context, maybe not entirely her fault. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think the answer would lean towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she made an effort to accommodate and the boyfriend's reaction was more about his own issues. However, some might argue she should have asked first. But given the circumstances, B is more likely the correct answer here.\n"
