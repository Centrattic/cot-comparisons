A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author, a woman, and her boyfriend went to get massages together. They had the option of male or female masseuses, so she booked her boyfriend with a male masseuse and herself with a female one. When she tells him, he's upset and says he won't let a man massage him because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. She tries to understand his reasoning, argues that massages are therapeutic, and even offers to switch. He says she's wrong, that she's making it up to argue, and that he's uncomfortable. He suggests canceling, and she goes without him. She's asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about consent and respecting boundaries. The author scheduled her boyfriend with a male masseuse without his input. Even though she tried to explain her reasoning, he felt uncomfortable. He had valid reasons based on his beliefs about massages being sexual. Even though she offered to switch, he still didn't want to proceed. So, by scheduling him with a male masseuse without his consent, she might have overstepped. She might have assumed he was okay with it, but he clearly wasn't. \n\nBut also, she was trying to discuss it and understand his perspective. She even offered to switch, which shows she was trying to accommodate him. However, the initial decision to book him with a male masseuse without asking him was the issue. Maybe she should have asked him first before making the bookings. Since they are in a relationship, it's important to communicate and make decisions together, especially when it involves his personal comfort.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The boyfriend's discomfort is valid, even if she disagrees with his reasoning. The author's action was scheduling without his input, leading to a situation where he felt uncomfortable. Even if she tried to explain and compromise, the initial decision was made unilaterally. So, maybe she is in the wrong for not checking with him first.\n\nBut some might argue that she had no reason to think he would be uncomfortable and that it was a normal service. However, massage can be a personal and sensitive issue for some people. So, the author should have discussed it with him before booking. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, she's in the wrong).\n"
