A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for booking a male masseuse for her boyfriend. The boyfriend gets upset and says massages are inherently sexual, so he won't go with the male masseuse. The author tried to understand his reasoning and offered to switch, but he refused and wanted to cancel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author thought the massage was therapeutic and wanted to make it efficient by matching genders. The boyfriend feels uncomfortable with a male masseuse because he thinks massages are sexual, maybe due to personal boundaries or past experiences. He's in a monogamous relationship, so he might feel that a massage with someone of the opposite sex could be a problem, even if it's not sexual in intent.\n\nThe author tried to discuss and compromise by offering to switch, but the boyfriend didn't accept. Is she wrong for making her own decision? Well, she might not have considered his feelings enough. Even if she thought it was logical, maybe she should have checked with him first instead of assuming he'd be okay. However, she did try to address his concerns once he raised them. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's refusal could be seen as making it about the author pushing her views. But if he's genuinely uncomfortable, then the author's initial choice might have been thoughtless. However, the key point is whether she was wrong in the first place. Since she made a choice without considering his possible discomfort, maybe she is at fault. But if she tried to address it, maybe not entirely. \n\nI think the main issue is that she scheduled it without discussing first. But since she made an effort to understand and compromise, maybe she's not entirely wrong. However, the boyfriend's discomfort is valid, and she should have checked with him before booking. So maybe the answer is A, she's in the wrong because she didn't communicate enough initially. Or B, not wrong because she tried to resolve it. Hmm. I'm a bit torn. But the fact that she scheduled without asking might be the main point. So Answer A.\n"
