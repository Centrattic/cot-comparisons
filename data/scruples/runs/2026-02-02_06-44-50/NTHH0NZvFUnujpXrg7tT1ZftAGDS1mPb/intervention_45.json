A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is about scheduling a boyfriend with a male masseuse when he later objects, saying massages are inherently sexual.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both perspectives. The author (a 21-year-old female) planned to get massages with her boyfriend (also 21) and chose a male masseuse for him and a female for herself. When she tells him, he refuses, citing that massages are sexual. She argues they're therapeutic and tries to discuss it, but he gets upset, says she's wrong, and eventually wants to cancel his massage. The author insists she just wanted to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch. He refuses and says it's too much trouble, so she goes without him. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to decide. Let's break it down. The key points are respecting boundaries and communication. The boyfriend expressed a discomfort with male masseuses because he sees massages as sexual. Even if the author doesn't agree, she should respect his boundaries once he's stated them. She tried to discuss it, offered to switch, but he still wasn't okay. Maybe she shouldn't have scheduled him with a male masseuse without checking first. However, she didn't know his preference beforehand. But once he expressed it, she kept pushing the discussion, leading to an argument. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might be overreacting, claiming massages are inherently sexual, which is a controversial stance. The author's intention was to facilitate a shared activity, which is reasonable. But when someone in a relationship has a clear boundary, the other partner should respect it. The author might have misjudged the situation by not confirming his preference before booking. Even if the reasoning seems flawed (massages being sexual), the boyfriend's comfort is important. The author's persistence in debating might have been counterproductive, making him feel judged instead of respected. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's comfort levels is crucial. The author could have avoided the issue by asking her boyfriend first. Since she didn't, and then continued to push the discussion after he expressed discomfort, she might be at fault for not respecting his boundaries upfront. However, the boyfriend's reasoning is questionable, but that doesn't excuse the author's actions. So, the answer might be A (she's in the wrong) because she didn't consider his boundaries before scheduling and then kept arguing instead of backing down after he was uncomfortable.\n"
