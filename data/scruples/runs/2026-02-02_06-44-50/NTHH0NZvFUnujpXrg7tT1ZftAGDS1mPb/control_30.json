A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author, a woman, booked a massage for her boyfriend with a male masseuse, and she chose a female masseuse for herself. The boyfriend isn't comfortable with the male masseuse because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author thinks massages are therapeutic. They had a discussion where the boyfriend says her view is irrational, and she tried to understand his reasoning. She even offered to switch, but he wanted to cancel his massage. Now the author is going to go without him. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's look at the key points. The author scheduled the massages, choosing based on the available masseuse's gender. The boyfriend is uncomfortable because he views massages as sexual. The author wants to understand his logic. She offered to switch, but he wanted to cancel. Now she's going without him.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Let's consider both sides. From her perspective, she wanted to get massages together, and she made a choice based on the available options. She tried to understand his discomfort and even offered to change. From the boyfriend's side, he's uncomfortable with male masseuse, possibly due to his personal beliefs about the sexual nature of massages. He's not willing to have the male masseuse and doesn't want to argue more, so he cancels his appointment.\n\nIs it wrong for the author to have scheduled the male masseuse? Well, she didn't know his preference beforehand. Maybe she assumed he wouldn't mind, but when he expressed discomfort, she tried to accommodate. The fact that she offered to switch shows she's trying to respect his wishes. However, he was firm in his refusal and wanted to cancel. So, maybe the issue here is about communication and mutual respect.\n\nThe author's intention was to plan a shared activity. But the boyfriend's discomfort is valid in the sense that personal boundaries about massages can be personal and not easily changed. The author might not be in the wrong because she acted in good faith, tried to adapt, and he was unwilling to compromise further. However, some might argue that she should have known his preference before booking. But since she didn't, and she made an effort to adjust after he spoke up, maybe she's not at fault.\n\nAnother angle: massages with opposite sex can be a sensitive topic. If the boyfriend feels that opposite-sex massages are inherently sexual, even in a monogamous relationship, his comfort is important. The author tried to discuss it, but he dismissed her efforts as irrational. That could indicate he's not open to dialogue, which complicates things. The author's insistence on understanding might have led to the argument, but she was trying to engage in a discussion rather than being confrontational.\n\nAlso, when he said to cancel his massage, maybe the author should have respected that without pushing further. But she did offer to switch, which could be seen as a reasonable compromise. However, he refused, so maybe it's his choice to cancel. In that case, the author isn't wrong for trying to accommodate but ultimately he chose to cancel.\n\nIn terms of consent and personal comfort, the author made a choice he wasn't comfortable with, but she tried to fix it. The key here is whether the initial booking was wrong. Since she didn't know his preference, maybe not. The responsibility is on both sides to communicate preferences beforehand, especially when it's a shared activity. If he didn't mention his discomfort earlier, that's on him. The author acted in good faith, tried to adjust, and he still wasn't okay. So she's not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
