  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse, and he's upset about it, saying massages are inherently sexual. She tried to understand his reasoning and offer a compromise, but he refused.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's intention was to split the masseuses by gender, which might be a common practice to avoid awkwardness or discomfort. However, the boyfriend is uncomfortable with a male masseuse, believing massages have a sexual connotation. He also feels that she's arguing just to argue, even when she tried to understand his viewpoint.\n\nMassages can be a sensitive topic. In some cultures or personal beliefs, massages might be seen as more than just therapeutic. The boyfriend's discomfort is valid, especially if he has personal reasons for feeling that way. The author's approach was to split based on gender, which could be a standard practice, but she didn't consider his specific feelings until after the booking. Her attempt to debate the issue might have come across as dismissive of his feelings, even if she was trying to understand. \n\nHe offered to cancel the appointment, which shows he's not just being difficult but genuinely uncomfortable. The author then decides to go without him, which seems reasonable since she's made an effort to accommodate his discomfort. However, the initial action of booking without considering his possible discomfort could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nBut then again, the boyfriend is also being rigid. The author did offer to switch masseuses, and he still refused. He might not have communicated his discomfort earlier. The question is whether the author was wrong in making the initial booking. While she had good intentions, not checking his comfort level first might be where she went wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's stance that massages are inherently sexual is a personal belief, not a universal truth. The author's attempt to understand his reasoning is a good approach, but the debate might have been counterproductive. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might have assumed splitting by gender was standard without discussing it first. The boyfriend's reaction, while valid, might have been an overreaction if massages aren't inherently sexual. However, his discomfort should be respected. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author made an assumption without checking in with her boyfriend first, leading to his discomfort. However, she did try to resolve it. The boyfriend's reaction was rigid but not entirely unwarranted. The author's initial action could be seen as inconsiderate, but her follow-up attempts to resolve were reasonable. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she made an effort to understand and accommodate his feelings after the fact. However, there's a case for A if one believes she should have checked first. But the key here is that after realizing his discomfort, she tried to fix it, which shows she's not entirely at fault.\n"
