A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this question. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author scheduling their boyfriend with a male masseuse, but he's now upset and says massages are inherently sexual. The author argues they're therapeutic, and there's a bit of a back-and-forth.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points here. The author chose the male masseuse for their boyfriend, which he's uncomfortable with. He claims it's because massages are sexual. The author tried to understand his reasoning, even offered to switch, but he didn't want to switch and wanted to cancel. The author is going ahead without him.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, respecting someone's boundaries is usually important. The boyfriend said he's uncomfortable with a male masseuse, which the author offered to switch, but he declined. So maybe the author isn't at fault because they tried to accommodate him. But the argument is about whether the author should have just respected his initial choice without pushing. The author wanted to understand his logic, which is a good effort at communication. However, the boyfriend felt that the author was making an argument out of it. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be in the right because they tried to find a solution (offering to switch) and he still refused. The author isn't forcing him to go with the male masseuse; they're going without him. So maybe the author isn't wrong here. The boyfriend has his own comfort level, but the author tried to address his concerns.\n\nBut maybe the author should have just respected his initial choice without pushing. However, the author's intention was to understand, not necessarily to force the issue. The boyfriend's response seems extreme, as he's not willing to switch or even continue the plan. The author is left going alone, which shows they're not trying to push the issue further once the boyfriend refuses to switch. \n\nIn terms of fault, the author tried to be accommodating. The boyfriend's refusal to switch and his assertion that the author is wrong might indicate his own issues, not the author's. So, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
