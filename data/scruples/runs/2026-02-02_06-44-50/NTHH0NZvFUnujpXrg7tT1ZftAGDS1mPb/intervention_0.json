  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation is that they both planned to get massages together. The author chose a male for her boyfriend and a female for herself. The boyfriend is uncomfortable with a male masseuse, saying massages are inherently sexual. The author tried to discuss it, but he felt she was arguing and didn't understand his discomfort. She offered to switch, but he wanted to cancel. The author still went without him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author might think she's being fair by splitting the masseuses based on gender, but maybe she didn't consider her boyfriend's feelings. He has a valid reason for being uncomfortable, especially if he feels massages are sexual. Even though the author wanted to understand his reasoning, the way the situation escalated might be her fault. She kept pushing for a discussion when he was clearly uncomfortable, leading to him wanting to cancel. \n\nBut then, he also might be overreacting. Massages are therapeutic in many contexts. However, personal boundaries are important. The author might not have recognized his discomfort early enough. Instead of forcing a debate, she could have respected his refusal from the start. She did offer to switch, but maybe she should have listened more and not insisted on discussing it as a debate. Her actions led to conflict where there didn't have to be one. \n\nSo, maybe the author is in the wrong because she didn't respect his immediate discomfort and turned it into an argument instead of just switching the booking without pushing for debate. The answer is A.\n"
