A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about scheduling a male masseuse for her boyfriend, who then gets upset.\n\nFirst, the author and her boyfriend planned to get massages together. They had options for male and female masseuses. She chose the male for him and female for herself. He's uncomfortable because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. She thinks they're therapeutic. He says she's wrong and accuses her of making it up to argue. She tried to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch, but he wanted to cancel instead.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, she made a decision without checking with him first. Even though it's a common thing to book others, maybe she should have asked his preference. He has a valid discomfort, especially if he feels it's sexual. She tried to discuss it, which is good, but he reacted negatively. He's the one who's uncomfortable, so maybe it's not her fault, but maybe she should have considered his feelings first. But the question is about whether she's in the wrong. Since he's the one who set the boundary about not wanting a male masseuse, she's respecting that now. The fact that she initially scheduled it without his input might be where she's at fault. But if she offered to switch later, maybe she's not. It's a bit of a toss-up. Some might say she should have checked first, others might say she's not wrong for trying to make a choice. The user's asking for AITA, and the options are A for yes (she's wrong) or B for no. Given that she tried to accommodate his discomfort after, maybe she's not in the wrong. But the initial decision to book without asking might be the issue. Hmm. I think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because she tried to fix it and he's the one with the personal boundary. But some might argue she should have asked first.\n"
