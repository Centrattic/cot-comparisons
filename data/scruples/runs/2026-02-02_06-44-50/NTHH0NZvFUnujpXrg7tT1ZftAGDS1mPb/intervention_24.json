A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for booking her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The boyfriend is uncomfortable with that and says massages are inherently sexual. The author thinks massages are purely therapeutic and is trying to understand his reasoning.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and comfort. The boyfriend clearly expressed his discomfort with a male masseuse. Even though the author thought she was being considerate by splitting the genders, she didn't take his feelings into account. She kept pushing to discuss and even offered to switch, but he wanted to cancel. \n\nThe key points here are respecting boundaries and not making someone uncomfortable. The author might have thought she was being fair, but the boyfriend's discomfort is valid. She continued the argument despite him wanting to drop it, which could come off as dismissive of his feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel she was trying to be open-minded and understand his perspective. But in this case, the boyfriend's primary concern is his comfort, and the author's insistence on discussion might have escalated the issue. \n\nSo, respecting his choice to cancel and not push further might have been the better approach. The author's actions, while well-intentioned, didn't prioritize his comfort first. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
