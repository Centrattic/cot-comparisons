A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about scheduling a boyfriend with a male masseuse while the writer gets a female one. The boyfriend then objects, saying massages are inherently sexual and refuses to go, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's reasoning is that massages are therapeutic and they just wanted to split the masseuses available. The boyfriend feels uncomfortable with a male masseuse, finding massages sexual, which he doesn't want in a monogamous relationship. The author tried to discuss and understand his reasoning, even offered to switch, but he refused and suggested canceling. The author went ahead without him.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, they made a choice based on their understanding of the service, but they did check availability and split the genders. The boyfriend's discomfort is about his own boundaries. The author tried to accommodate by offering to switch, which shows they considered his feelings. However, he still refused. The author's actions were based on their belief in the therapeutic nature of massages, which isn't inherently wrong. The boyfriend's refusal might be about personal boundaries and how he perceives the massage context. The author's intention was to plan a shared activity, and they made an effort to adjust when conflict arose. The key is whether the author overstepped by not respecting the boyfriend's clear discomfort. But since the author did try to adjust and the boyfriend still refused, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction seems extreme given the author's efforts. So the answer might be B (No).\n"
