A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, a woman, booked her boyfriend with a male masseuse when they were getting massages together. The boyfriend is upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual and doesn't want a man to massage him. The author is trying to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch, but he ended up saying to cancel his massage and went home without her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that she wanted to book based on the available options (male and female masseuses) and thought it was a neutral decision. She sees massages as purely therapeutic and wanted to understand his discomfort. On the other hand, the boyfriend feels that massages have a sexual connotation, which makes him uncomfortable with a male masseuse. He's frustrated that she's pushing the issue and argues that she's making something up to debate.\n\nSo the key points here are about consent and respecting personal boundaries. The author tried to accommodate by offering to switch, but he didn't want to proceed. If someone is uncomfortable with a particular arrangement, even if the other person thinks the reason is irrational, it's about respecting their feelings. The author was trying to explain and understand, but when he said he's uncomfortable, she still went ahead without him. However, he then canceled his own appointment. \n\nIs the author wrong for initially assigning the male masseuse? Maybe not, since she didn't know his preference. But when he expressed discomfort, she tried to address it. But he ended up not going. The question is whether her initial action was wrong. Since she tried to be understanding and offered alternatives, maybe she's not wrong. The boyfriend's reaction is also a factor; he chose to cancel rather than compromise further. \n\nBut maybe the author should have asked for their preferences before booking, especially since they were going together. However, in some cases, people might not consider that aspect unless it's a concern. So it's a bit of a gray area. The author's intention was to split the genders, which might be a common practice (like male for male, female for female), but the boyfriend's reasoning about massages being sexual is his personal belief. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author tried to resolve the issue by offering to switch, which he refused. So she's not in the wrong for trying to understand. The boyfriend's decision to cancel is his choice, but he's upset with her for pushing the issue. However, she was trying to facilitate the activity, and his refusal might be more about his own discomfort than her being wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she made an effort to accommodate his preferences after he expressed discomfort, and the boyfriend's refusal was a personal choice. The author isn't at fault for trying to understand and adjust her initial decision.\n"
