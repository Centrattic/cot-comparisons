A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple who booked massages together. The author (a woman) scheduled her boyfriend with a male masseuse and herself with a female. The boyfriend then gets upset, saying he won't have a male masseuse because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author tried to discuss it, but he called her arguments irrational and even suggested canceling the massage. She's now going without him.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. Let me break down the key points. The author scheduled the massages based on availability, choosing male and female masseuses. The boyfriend is uncomfortable with a male masseuse, citing it as sexual. She wanted to understand his reasoning and offered to switch, but he refused and wanted to cancel. \n\nNow, considering consent and comfort. The boyfriend's discomfort is valid if he feels massages are sexual. But the author didn't know that beforehand. She made a decision, and he later expressed his feelings. She tried to accommodate by offering to switch, which shows she's trying to resolve the issue. However, he didn't communicate his preference earlier, which might be a point. \n\nIs she wrong for scheduling him with a male masseuse without knowing his preference? It's possible he didn't mention it before. But she might not have known. On the other hand, maybe she should have asked about his preferences, but since he didn't mention it, it's hard to say she's wrong. \n\nHe's refusing to switch and canceling shows he's not willing to compromise. But the author is trying to understand and adjust. The key here is mutual communication. If he didn't express his discomfort earlier, maybe the fault isn't entirely on her. She's willing to switch, but he's not. So perhaps he's being inflexible. \n\nThe author is not in the wrong because she made an honest mistake in scheduling without prior knowledge. She tried to fix it. The boyfriend's reaction is about his own boundaries, which he didn't communicate before. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
