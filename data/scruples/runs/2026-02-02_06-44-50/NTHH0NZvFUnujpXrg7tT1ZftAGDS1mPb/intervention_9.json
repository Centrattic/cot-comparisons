  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author scheduled her boyfriend with a male masseuse, but he's uncomfortable with that because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. She tried to discuss it, and he ended up canceling and being upset. She's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's perspective: she wanted to get massages together and thought choosing a male masseuse for her boyfriend and a female for herself was logical. She tried to understand his reasoning but he felt she was arguing and not taking his discomfort seriously. She even offered to switch, but he refused and canceled. She went ahead without him.\n\nThe boyfriend's perspective: he feels that massages are sexual, so a male masseuse is a problem. He's in a monogamous relationship but still has issues with it. He might feel that receiving a massage from someone of the opposite sex is uncomfortable, maybe due to personal boundaries or past experiences. He also felt she was being argumentative when he just wanted to express his discomfort without debate.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. The key points here are consent and respecting boundaries. If the boyfriend is uncomfortable with male masseuses, the author should have respected that. However, the author might not have known his preference beforehand. But she did schedule it, which could be seen as not considering his feelings. She tried to discuss it, but he felt she was pushing. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might have assumed she knew his preference, but maybe she didn't. On the other hand, the boyfriend could have communicated his needs better earlier. However, when he made it clear, she did offer to switch. His response was to cancel, which might be overreacting. But the author's initial scheduling without checking in with him could be the issue. \n\nSo, considering that the author scheduled it without considering his potential discomfort and then the discussion turned into an argument, she might be in the wrong. It's about respecting each other's boundaries. Even if the author didn't know, once he expressed discomfort, she tried to accommodate. But his reaction was harsh. But the initial act of scheduling without checking could be seen as the problem. \n\nHmm. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because she didn't check his preference first, but then she tried to adjust. However, the boyfriend's reaction is also problematic. But the question is about the author. Since she scheduled based on her own choice without knowing his discomfort, maybe she's at fault. So answer A.\n"
