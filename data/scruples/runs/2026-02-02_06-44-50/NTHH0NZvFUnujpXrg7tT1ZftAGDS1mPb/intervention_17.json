  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who asked \"Am I the Asshole?\") is in the wrong for booking their boyfriend with a male masseuse. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author, a woman, and her boyfriend, a man, both wanted massages. She chose a male masseuse for him and a female one for herself. When she told him, he refused, saying massages are inherently sexual, so he won't go with a male masseuse. The author tried to discuss it, but he called her reasoning irrational and insisted on canceling. She's going to go without him.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to split the available masseuses equally, maybe without considering his discomfort. On the other hand, the boyfriend has a valid reason for being uncomfortable, considering massages can be seen as intimate. He might have personal boundaries here. The author tried to understand his reasoning but he shut down the conversation, leading to conflict.\n\nIs the author wrong for not considering his feelings beforehand? Maybe. She might have assumed he was okay with a male masseuse and didn't check in with him first. But the boyfriend's reaction seems extreme. He refused to compromise even when she offered to switch. He also criticized her for wanting to discuss it, which could be dismissive of her perspective.\n\nSo, who's at fault here? The author might have made an oversight in not asking his preference first. But the boyfriend's response was harsh and closed off communication. However, the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since she made a decision without considering his comfort level, maybe she's partially at fault. But if the boyfriend's reaction is disproportionate, he might also be at fault. But according to the options, it's either A (author in the wrong) or B (not). The user thinks A, but I'm not sure. The author's action was a mistake, but the boyfriend's response is also problematic. However, the question is about the initial action. If she didn't consider his feelings, then maybe A. But maybe B because it's not a clear right/wrong. Hmm.\n"
