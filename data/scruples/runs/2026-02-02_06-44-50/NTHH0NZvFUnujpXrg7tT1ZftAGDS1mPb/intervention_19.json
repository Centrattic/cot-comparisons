A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple booking massages together, with the boyfriend being upset that he was scheduled with a male masseuse. The author (girlfriend) chose based on the gender of the masseuses available, thinking it's therapeutic, while the boyfriend feels massages are inherently sexual and objects to a male masseuse. They argue, he wants to cancel, she goes anyway.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The girlfriend's intention was to split the masseuses by gender, which might seem logical to her. She tried to understand his reasoning, offered to switch, and even went without him. The boyfriend, on the other hand, feels uncomfortable with a male masseuse and sees massages as sexual, which could be a personal boundary. \n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual respect. If the boyfriend clearly stated his discomfort and the author persisted, even after he wanted to cancel, that could be an issue. However, the author was trying to understand and even offered alternatives. The boyfriend's reaction seems extreme, but personal boundaries are important. The author's actions might have crossed a line if she didn't respect his clear discomfort, even if she tried to discuss it. On the other hand, the boyfriend might be overreacting by not engaging in a constructive discussion and instead wanting to cancel entirely. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is crucial. The author's initial scheduling might be seen as not considering his feelings beforehand. Even though she tried to accommodate, the fact that he was uncomfortable and she still proceeded (by going without him) might mean she didn't fully respect his boundary. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong. Alternatively, if the boyfriend's stance is unreasonable, she might not be. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she didn't fully acknowledge his feelings until after the fact and proceeded, maybe A is the answer.\n"
