A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, who's a woman, booked her boyfriend, a man, with a male masseuse, and herself with a female one. The boyfriend is upset because he says massages with the opposite sex are inherently sexual, and he refuses to go with the male masseus. The author tried to discuss his reasoning, and he thinks she's being irrational and just wants to argue. She even offered to switch, but he said to cancel his appointment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that massages are therapeutic and not sexual. She probably thought it was neutral to split the bookings based on the available masseuses. On the other hand, the boyfriend feels uncomfortable with a male masseuse because he believes massages have a sexual connotation. Maybe he has personal boundaries or past experiences that make him uncomfortable. \n\nNow, the key point here is about respecting each other's boundaries. The author might not have considered his discomfort upfront. Even though she thought it was a straightforward split, she should have checked with him first. However, when he expressed his discomfort, she tried to engage in a debate to understand his reasoning. That might have come off as dismissive of his feelings. \n\nBut then, he responded by refusing to switch and wanting to cancel, which seems rigid. The author's offer to switch shows she was trying to accommodate, but he wasn't willing to budge. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for initially not considering his comfort, or if he's being unreasonable by not being flexible.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author could have asked his preference before booking. However, once he expressed discomfort, she tried to address it. The boyfriend's refusal to switch and escalating the issue might be his fault. But the author's insistence on debating the logic might have made him feel attacked, leading to his defensive response. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? She might have made a mistake by not checking with him first, but she tried to resolve it by offering to switch. The boyfriend's reaction seems extreme. However, the author's approach in discussing the issue as a debate could have been counterproductive. Maybe she should have focused on his feelings rather than trying to debate the nature of massages. \n\nIn the end, since she made an effort to adjust but he didn't reciprocate, the wrong might not be entirely hers. But the initial booking without his input could be a point against her. However, the boyfriend's rigidity in not allowing any compromise might place more blame on him. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I'm a bit torn because both sides have some issues. But according to the options, I have to pick A or B. Since the author tried to resolve it and the boyfriend refused to switch, maybe she's not in the wrong. So I'll go with B.\n"
