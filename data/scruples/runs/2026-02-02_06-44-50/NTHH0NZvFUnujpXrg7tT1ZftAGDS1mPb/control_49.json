He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this question. So, the user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for booking her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation is that they both planned to get massages together. The author, a 21-year-old female, booked her boyfriend (M/21) with a male masseuse and herself with a female one. When she told him, he was upset and said he wouldn't let a man massage him because massages are inherently sexual. The author thought massages are therapeutic and tried to understand his reasoning, but he insisted she was wrong and that she was making it up to argue. He said she was pushing something he's uncomfortable with, and when she offered to switch, he wanted to cancel. She's going ahead without him.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let me break this down. First, the main issue is about personal boundaries and comfort. The boyfriend has a strong objection to male masseus, citing that massages are sexual. The author doesn't agree, thinking they're therapeutic. Now, when she made the booking, did she overstep?\n\nI think the key points here are consent and respect for each other's boundaries. Even if the author didn't agree with his reasoning, she should have considered his feelings. By booking him with a male masseuse without discussing it first, she might have disregarded his comfort. But wait, she did offer to switch after he objected. However, he was already upset and wanted to cancel. So, maybe she should have checked in with him before making the booking. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Even if the author thought she was being rational, she might have forced her view on him. The boyfriend's discomfort is valid, even if his reasoning about massages being sexual is subjective. She could have asked his preference before booking. The fact that he's in a monogamous relationship and still feels massages are sexual might be his personal belief, but that's his right. \n\nThe author tried to debate and understand his logic, which is good, but maybe she should have prioritized his comfort over the discussion. The boyfriend's reaction was strong, leading him to want to cancel. So, in this case, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting his boundaries upfront. But wait, he didn't tell her his preference beforehand. Maybe he should have communicated that earlier. However, she initiated the booking, so perhaps she should have asked first. \n\nI think the answer here is B (No, she's not in the wrong) because she made an assumption, but he should have communicated his preferences. However, some might argue she should have checked first. But the main issue is that she tried to understand his reasoning and offered to switch. The boyfriend's reaction seems extreme. Maybe she's not in the wrong because she acted in good faith, but she could have communicated better. Wait, but the question is whether she is in the wrong. If she scheduled without his input, that's a problem. But maybe the answer is B (No) because she had the intention to switch and didn't know his preference beforehand. It's a bit of a toss-up. I think the key is that she made a choice based on her understanding, but he had a different boundary. However, she did try to accommodate after he spoke up. So maybe she's not in the wrong. But some might say she should have checked first. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, the boyfriend's reasoning that massages are sexual is his personal belief, but the author is not wrong to think they are therapeutic. So she's not in the wrong for acting on her belief. However, the act of booking without checking his preference is where the issue is. So maybe she's in the wrong for not checking first. But the question is if she's in the wrong for scheduling. The answer could be A (Yes) because she didn't consider his boundaries. But others might say he should have communicated earlier. The answer here is probably A or B. \n\nI think the correct answer is A (Yes, she is in the wrong) because she scheduled without considering his preferences, even if she tried to fix it later. Respecting his boundaries should have been the priority from the start.\n"
