  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault here. The situation is about scheduling a male masseuse for her boyfriend after they both had planned to get massages together. The boyfriend is upset because he doesn't want a male masseuse and thinks massages are inherently sexual, while the author believes they're therapeutic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author made a choice based on availability, maybe thinking it's fair to split the genders. But the boyfriend is uncomfortable. The key here is about respecting each other's boundaries. The author tried to understand his reasoning, which is good, but he became defensive. He even said she's wrong for pushing the issue. \n\nThe author offered to switch, which shows she's trying to accommodate him. But he refused and wanted to cancel. The question is if she's wrong for initially booking him with a male masseuse. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to communicate and respect each other's comfort levels. Even though she had good intentions, she might have overlooked his sensitivity about it. However, she did attempt to resolve it by offering a switch. His reaction seems harsh, but maybe she could have considered his feelings more upfront. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely wrong because she tried to adjust, but maybe she could have been more considerate of his possible discomfort from the start. However, given that she made an effort to change things, the main issue here is the boyfriend's discomfort and how he reacted. So the answer would be B, No, the author isn't in the wrong. She tried to be understanding and flexible, even though the situation led to conflict.\n"
