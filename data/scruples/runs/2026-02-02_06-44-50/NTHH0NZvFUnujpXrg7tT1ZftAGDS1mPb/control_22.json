A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (a female) is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend (a male) with a male masseuse during a joint massage appointment.\n\nFirst, the situation: They both wanted massages together. The author chose a male masseuse for him and a female for herself. The boyfriend objected, claiming massages are inherently sexual, so he refuses a male masseuse. The author tried to understand his reasoning, even offered to switch, but he insists on canceling. Now she's going ahead without him.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author made a decision based on the available options, perhaps assuming gender wasn't an issue. The boyfriend then expressed discomfort, which she tried to address by switching masseuses. But he refused to budge, leading to the cancellation.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, she didn't know his preference beforehand. It's reasonable to assume that in a shared activity, unless stated otherwise, people might not have strong gender preferences. She tried to accommodate by offering a switch, which shows she respected his feelings once they came up. He, on the other hand, was rigid in his stance, not willing to compromise beyond canceling. \n\nBut the question is about the author's actions. She didn't push the issue; she tried to find a solution. The boyfriend's discomfort is his own issue, and the author wasn't wrong for trying to adjust. The fact that he refused to switch despite her offer suggests his own inflexibility. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong. She made a choice without prior knowledge, attempted to resolve the issue, and he's the one who's being inflexible. Her actions were reasonable and considerate once he expressed discomfort.\n"
