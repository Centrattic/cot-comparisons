A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a woman, scheduled her boyfriend, who is a man, with a male masseuse and herself with a female one. The boyfriend didn't like that and said he wouldn't let a man massage him because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author thinks massages are therapeutic and tried to discuss his reasoning. The boyfriend got upset, said she was being irrational, and wanted to cancel the massages. She's asking if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author made a choice based on available options, perhaps assuming that her boyfriend would be comfortable with either. But the boyfriend has a strong objection rooted in his personal beliefs about massages being sexual. Maybe he's uncomfortable with a male masseuse because he thinks it could be seen as inappropriate or because of his relationship. \n\nThe author tried to understand his reasoning, which is a good step. She offered to switch masseuses, showing she's trying to be accommodating. But the boyfriend refused and wanted to cancel, which is his prerogative if he's truly uncomfortable. However, the author then went ahead without him, which might be a point of contention. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she didn't know his preference beforehand, so she might not be at fault for scheduling based on available options. However, maybe she should have checked his comfort level first. But the boyfriend's reaction seems to be more about his own discomfort than her action. The argument arises because he sees massages as sexual, which is a personal belief. The author's desire to understand his reasoning isn't inherently wrong. The boyfriend's refusal to adjust and his accusation that she's being irrational could also be problematic. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's boundaries. If the boyfriend is uncomfortable with a male masseuse, the author might have been unaware of that boundary. However, she tried to resolve it by offering a switch. The boyfriend's response of wanting to cancel and not being open to discussion might be the main issue here. The author's decision to go without him could be seen as her right, especially if he's not willing to compromise. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because she tried to accommodate his preference and he was the one who walked away. The boyfriend's stance and reaction might be more to blame here. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
