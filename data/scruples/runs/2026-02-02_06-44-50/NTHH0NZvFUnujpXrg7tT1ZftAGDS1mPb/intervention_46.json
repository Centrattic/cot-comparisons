A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author here is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author and her boyfriend planned to get massages together. There were two options: a male and a female masseuse. She chose the male for him and the female for herself. When she told him, he said he wouldn't let a man massage him because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author disagrees, thinking they're therapeutic. She tried to discuss his reasoning, but he called her irrational and even said to cancel his appointment, which she decided to do without him.\n\nNow, I need to decide if she's in the wrong. First, she made a decision without consulting him first. That might be a problem because it's his body and his comfort. Even if she had good intentions, not asking his preference first could be an issue. But maybe she thought it was a minor choice, especially if they were going together. However, when he expressed discomfort, she tried to understand his reasoning. He then became defensive and refused to engage constructively, leading to the argument.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. She scheduled it without checking with him, which he found uncomfortable. Even if she offered to switch, his main point is that he's uncomfortable with male masseuses because he sees massages as sexual. That's his personal boundary. By not respecting his initial preference, she might have overstepped. However, he also reacted negatively and didn't engage in a constructive way when she tried to understand his perspective.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? She didn't consult him first, which is a mistake. But the situation is complex. He has a personal boundary that she didn't consider, which is valid. She tried to resolve it, but he was unwilling to compromise. The question is whether her initial decision was wrong. Since she didn't ask his preference first, that's a point against her. However, he also has the right to set boundaries. The fact that she offered to switch shows she tried to accommodate after the fact. But maybe the better approach would have been to ask first. So, maybe she's partially at fault. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she made the decision without his input and he was uncomfortable, she might be in the wrong. But his reaction also contributed to the conflict. The answer is A or B?\n\nIn \"Am I the Asshole\" scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person acted with malice or disregarded the other's feelings. She didn't know his preference until after booking, so maybe she wasn't malicious. But she should have checked. However, he also has a valid discomfort. So, maybe she's not entirely in the wrong, but part of the issue is that she didn't consider his boundaries. The answer might be A (she's in the wrong) because she scheduled it without his input, but the situation is nuanced. However, some might say B (not in the wrong) because he's being unreasonable. But since he has a personal boundary, she should respect it. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
