  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author scheduled her boyfriend with a male masseuse, and he's really upset about it. She thought it was a fair split\u2014each of them with a different gender. But he says massages are inherently sexual, and he's uncomfortable with a male masseuse. She tried to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch, but he didn't want to go anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to split the massages by gender, which seems like a neutral approach. She didn't know he had a strong preference against male masseuses. He claims that massages are sexual, so having a male masseuse is an issue. But why is that the case? Maybe he's uncomfortable with a man touching him, which could be related to personal boundaries or past experiences. However, he's okay with getting massages in general, just not from a man. \n\nThe author tried to discuss his reasons and even offered to switch, which shows she's trying to accommodate his feelings. But he refused and said she was being irrational. Is it wrong for her to have scheduled the male masseuse without knowing his preference? Probably not. She didn't know about his discomfort beforehand. But maybe she should have checked his preference before booking, assuming it's something personal. \n\nOn the other hand, he could have communicated his boundaries earlier. If he has such a strong aversion, maybe he should have mentioned it when making the appointment. The author tried to be accommodating, but he dismissed her efforts and decided to cancel. His reaction seems a bit extreme, especially since she was trying to understand rather than just dismiss his feelings. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author made a decision based on the available options and a split by gender. She didn't know about his discomfort, so she's not intentionally causing harm. The boyfriend could have communicated his preference earlier, but the author tried to resolve the issue by offering a switch. His refusal and labeling her as irrational might be the problem here. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. She acted in good faith and tried to resolve the issue. The boyfriend's reaction seems more problematic because he didn't communicate his needs upfront and dismissed her attempts to accommodate him. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
