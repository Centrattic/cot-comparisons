  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person writes about scheduling their boyfriend with a male masseuse while they themselves got a female masseuse. The boyfriend is upset because he feels massages are inherently sexual, so he refuses. The author tried to discuss his reasoning, offered to switch, but he wanted to cancel. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author's action was to book the massages, choosing male and female masseuses. The boyfriend had a clear discomfort with the male masseuse, citing that massages are sexual. The author tried to understand his perspective, which is a good sign. But the boyfriend felt the author was making it an argument. The key here is consent and comfort. The author might have assumed the boyfriend was okay with the male masseuse, but he wasn't. By pushing to understand and even offering to switch, the author showed willingness to accommodate, but the boyfriend's refusal to switch and insistence on canceling suggests he was very firm. However, the author continued to go without him, which might not be the issue here.\n\nThe main issue is whether the author overstepped by not respecting the boyfriend's initial discomfort. Even if the author's intention was to have a balanced setup (male and female), they should have checked with the boyfriend first. The boyfriend's discomfort is valid, and the author might have caused unnecessary tension by not seeking his input. So, even though the author tried to resolve it, the initial action without considering his feelings could be seen as the problem. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting his partner's boundaries upfront.\n"
