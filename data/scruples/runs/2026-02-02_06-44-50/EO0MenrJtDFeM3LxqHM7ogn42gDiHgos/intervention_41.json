My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about splitting a pizza with his wife. The author wants 60% for himself because he's bigger and eats more, while the wife insists on half each. The author plans to take more after she's done eating her half.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife allowed him to order pizza because he found a coupon, which suggests some compromise already. The author mentions that they are equals, but he's using his size and appetite as a reason to take more. However, fairness in relationships often involves mutual respect and compromise, even if there's a physical difference. The wife might feel that equal division is fair, especially since they split other things 50-50, like the sushi outings. \n\nThe author's plan to take her leftovers after she's done eating her half could be seen as deceitful or not respecting her wishes. Even if she eats less than half, he's still going against her stated preference. The concept of equality in sharing might be more about mutual agreement rather than physical needs. Plus, the author's actions could be viewed as manipulative, using her own declared portion against her.\n\nOn the other hand, the author argues based on his size and metabolism, which is a valid point. But in a relationship, it's about finding a balance that both parties are comfortable with. The wife's insistence on half might be a non-negotiable for her, and the author's plan to circumvent that could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. The key here is communication and respecting each other's boundaries. If the author can't agree, maybe he should order a larger pizza to accommodate both portions without forcing her to give up her share. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is manipulating the situation to get more than agreed upon, which might make him the asshole. The answer is A.\n"
