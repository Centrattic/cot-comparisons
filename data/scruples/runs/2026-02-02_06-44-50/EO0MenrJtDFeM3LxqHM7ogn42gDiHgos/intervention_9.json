My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting more than half the pizza. The situation is about a couple where the husband wants to split a pizza 60-40 in his favor, while the wife wants it 50-50.\n\nFirst, the husband ordered a pizza using a coupon with the wife's permission. He argues that because he's taller, bigger, and eats more, 60% is fair. The wife, on the other hand, insists on equality since they're supposed to be equal. The husband even mentions he takes her to sushi places where she gets the better, more expensive options, so he thinks it's fair for him to get more pizza. However, he's planning to take advantage of her eating less by finishing her half, leading her to eat natto instead of leftover pizza the next day.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about fairness and communication. The wife wants equality, which is a valid perspective. The husband is using his size and eating habits as justification, but that might not be the best reason. Even if he eats more, the wife's insistence on equal sharing could be about fairness in the relationship, not just physical needs. The husband's plan to take her portion after she's done eating might come across as manipulative, which could hurt their relationship. Also, the wife's permission was for the order, not necessarily for the split, so he might be overstepping by not respecting her terms. \n\nAnother angle is the concept of \"equal partnership.\" The wife might feel that sharing equally is part of being equal, regardless of individual needs. The husband's approach could be seen as selfish, even if he's trying to balance it with other gestures like taking her to sushi. The main issue is that he's not respecting her terms, which could lead to resentment. The husband's solution of eating her leftovers isn't fair and might be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, while the husband has his reasons, the wife's request for equal division is a reasonable expectation in a relationship. The husband's plan to work around her wishes doesn't seem respectful. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
