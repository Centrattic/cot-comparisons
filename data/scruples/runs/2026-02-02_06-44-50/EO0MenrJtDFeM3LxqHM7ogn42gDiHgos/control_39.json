My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about dividing a pizza between a husband and wife. The husband ordered a pizza using a coupon his wife gave him. He wants to split it 60-40 in his favor because he's bigger and eats more, but the wife wants half each.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife allowed him to order the pizza, so she's already giving in to his desire despite her concerns about health and cost. The husband feels that a 50-50 split isn't fair because of their different appetites. He also mentions that he takes her to sushi places where he lets her order the more expensive items, implying a balance in their interactions.\n\nThe key points here are consent and fairness. The wife agreed to the pizza purchase, so there's mutual agreement. However, the division of the pizza is a separate issue. The husband is arguing that physical size and appetite justify a different split. The wife, on the other hand, insists on equality in portions, possibly as a principle of fairness in their relationship.\n\nI need to assess if the husband's plan to take the remaining pizza after she's done eating her half is fair. He's not being forceful but is taking advantage of her eating less than half. From the husband's perspective, it's about practicality (his larger appetite), but from the wife's, it's about equal sharing. \n\nIn relationships, fairness can be subjective. The wife might feel that the 50-50 is a fair agreement they should both stick to, especially since she allowed the purchase in the first place. The husband's approach could be seen as undermining that agreement by not adhering to the equal split, even if he's not actively taking more when she's not looking. \n\nAlso, the husband's plan to let her eat her fill and then take the leftovers might be seen as manipulative, even if well-intentioned. He's not directly forcing her to eat natto, but by taking the pizza, he's affecting her choice for breakfast. This could be seen as a power imbalance or a lack of consideration for her preferences.\n\nSo, considering all that, the husband's actions, while practical to him, might be inconsiderate of the wife's expectations of equality. Therefore, he might be in the wrong.\n"
