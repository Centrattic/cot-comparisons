My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about splitting a pizza with their wife. The author wants 60% for himself because he's bigger and eats more, while the wife insists on splitting it 50-50. The author plans to let her eat her fill, which he thinks will be less than half, and then take the rest. \n\nFirst, the wife gave permission to buy the pizza because of a coupon. She probably expects to share it equally. The author argues that his body requires more food, but equality in relationships often isn't just about physical needs; it's about fairness in the relationship. The wife's point is about equality as equal partners, not about their body sizes. \n\nThe author mentions that he takes her to sushi, but he orders cheap plates while she gets expensive ones. That might be a point in his favor if he's trying to be fair by letting her have the better parts. However, the pizza situation is different. The author is trying to justify taking more based on size, which the wife might see as not respecting her half.\n\nThe key here is mutual respect and compromise. The wife might feel that the author isn't considering her feelings despite her dietary preferences and the health concerns. The author's plan to take more after she eats her fill could make her feel that her agreement was not respected. Even if she ends up eating less, the act of insisting on 60-40 might be seen as undermining the fairness she expects.\n\nSo, the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate of his wife's wishes, even if he has a logical reason. The wife's insistence on equality is about partnership, not just portion sizes. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not compromising and for planning to take more than agreed upon.\n"
