My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person in this situation is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the details carefully.\n\nThe guy wants to order a pizza using a coupon he found, and his wife gave him permission. He says he orders a large pizza not for value but because he just likes eating a lot of it. The issue is that his wife wants half the pizza each, but he thinks a 60-40 split is fair because he's bigger and eats more. He mentions he brings this up before but she insists on equal sharing. He also says he takes her to sushi four times a year, but he eats cheap plates while she has the expensive ones. So he's trying to be fair in other ways, but she's still not budging on the pizza. His plan is to let her eat her \"half\" until she's full, then take the leftovers for himself. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let me break it down. The wife allowed him to order pizza with the coupon, so that's agreed upon. The problem is the split. The husband argues that his body size and appetite justify a larger share. The wife wants equal portions because of equality in the relationship. \n\nOn one hand, equality in relationships often means sharing equally, regardless of physical size. The wife might feel that they're a team and should share things equally. On the other hand, the husband has a valid point about differing appetites. But the way he's planning to take more by letting her eat until she's full and then taking the rest might be seen as manipulative or not respecting her agreed-upon share. \n\nHe mentions he does similar things in reverse with sushi, where he lets her have the expensive ones. So maybe he's trying to balance things out, but she still demands equality on the pizza. The key here is communication and mutual agreement. If they can't come to a compromise, maybe the husband is being a bit petty by not respecting her preference for equal sharing, even if he thinks it's unfair. \n\nAlso, his plan to take more after she's full might make her feel like her share isn't respected. The wife might see this as him circumventing the agreement. So even if he thinks it's fair, the action of not following through on the 50-50 split could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband's reasoning is based on his body size and appetite, but in many relationships, equal sharing is a norm. The fact that he's going against that and using a loophole could make him the asshole. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong).\n"
