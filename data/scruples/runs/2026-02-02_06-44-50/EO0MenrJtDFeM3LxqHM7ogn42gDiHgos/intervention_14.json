My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario is about dividing a pizza between them and their wife. The author wants a 60-40 split because they're bigger and eat more, but the wife wants it split 50-50. The author plans to let the wife eat her half first, then take the leftovers from her portion, even if she's not finished.\n\nHmm, so the key points here. The wife gave permission for the pizza because of the coupon. The author acknowledges that the wife doesn't like pizza, so maybe she's not the biggest fan. The author also mentions being more physically active or larger, hence needing more food. But the wife insists on equal sharing based on equality. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the wife might feel that since they both paid for it (assuming they share expenses), it's 50-50. The author argues based on body size and appetite. But maybe the wife's insistence is about fairness in the relationship, not just physical needs. The author's plan to take leftovers from her half could be seen as manipulative or not respecting her wishes, even if the wife eats less. \n\nThe author also mentions other things like taking her to sushi, but that might not be directly relevant. The main issue is the pizza division. The author is willing to let the wife eat as much as she can, then take the rest. That might come off as sneaky or not being straightforward. The wife might feel disrespected if the author isn't adhering to the agreed split. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, in relationships, mutual respect is key. If the wife said it's 50-50, the author should honor that unless there's a mutual agreement to change it. The author's plan to take more by letting her eat first could be seen as circumventing the agreed-upon split. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by not respecting her wishes despite their reasoning.\n"
