My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting a pizza with their wife.\n\nFirst, the wife gave permission to buy the pizza because of a coupon. The husband wants 60% for himself because he's bigger and eats more. The wife insists on 50-50. The husband also mentions he takes her to sushi four times a year, but he only orders cheap ones, while she orders expensive ones. He seems to feel that since he's paying and he eats more, he should get more pizza.\n\nThe key points here are consent and fairness. The wife allowed him to buy the pizza, but maybe the terms were mutual. If she agreed to the purchase under the condition that it's split equally, then the husband is going against that agreement. Also, the idea of equality in a relationship is important. Even if he eats more, splitting things equally might be a shared value. The husband's plan to take advantage of her eating less and then taking the rest is manipulative. He's making her give up her share without her knowing, which is unfair and possibly disrespectful. \n\nOn the other hand, he does try to be thoughtful by taking her to sushi, but that doesn't necessarily justify taking more pizza. The fact that he's willing to let her have breakfast with natto instead of pizza leftovers shows he's not considering her preferences. Relationships require mutual respect, and this seems like the husband isn't respecting her wishes. The wife's insistence on equality might be about fairness rather than just the amount. So the husband is in the wrong here for not respecting the agreed-upon split and being manipulative.\n"
