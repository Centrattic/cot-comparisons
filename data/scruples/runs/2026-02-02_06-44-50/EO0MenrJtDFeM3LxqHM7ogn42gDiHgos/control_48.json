My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the pizza situation is in the wrong. The question is between A and B.\n\nSo the scenario is about a husband and wife disagreeing on how to split a pizza. The husband wants 60-40 in his favor because he's bigger and eats more, while the wife insists on splitting it 50-50. The husband mentions that he only orders pizza 4 times a year and takes her to sushi places where he's more frugal so she can have better meals. But he's planning to let her eat her half first and then take whatever's left, even if she ends up not eating her full share and he does. The wife might have to eat natto instead of leftover pizza the next day.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about fairness and mutual respect. The wife wants equality, 50-50. The husband argues it's unfair because of their body sizes and eating habits. But the wife's perspective is about equality in the relationship. The husband's plan to take the leftovers after she eats might leave her with nothing if she's not hungry, which could be seen as manipulative. Also, he's not directly addressing her wishes but instead going around them. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband is trying to be fair based on their physical needs. However, in relationships, respecting each other's preferences and agreements is important. The wife gave permission to order the pizza with the coupon, but the split is a mutual decision. If she insists on 50-50, maybe the husband should honor that as part of the compromise, especially since it's not a frequent occurrence. His plan to take the leftovers could be seen as undermining her wishes, even if he's technically not forcing her. \n\nAlso, the husband's justification of taking what's left might lead to resentment. The wife might feel her wishes are not respected, even if she ends up not eating her half. The husband's approach is a bit sneaky, which could be considered inconsiderate. \n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the husband is in the wrong because he's not respecting his wife's stated preference for equality, even if he has a logical reason. The answer might be A, he is in the wrong. But I'm a bit conflicted because there's a practical aspect to eating habits. However, in relationships, respecting each other's terms, even if they seem unequal in practice, is usually more important. So I think the answer is A.\n"
