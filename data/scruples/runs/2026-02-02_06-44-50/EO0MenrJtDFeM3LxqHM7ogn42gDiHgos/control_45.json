My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for expecting more than half the pizza. So the main issue here is the division of food between them and their wife.\n\nFirst, the wife gave permission to order the pizza with a coupon, so that's a point in their favor. They mention that the wife insists on a 50-50 split, but the author thinks 60-40 makes sense because they're bigger and eat more. The wife's argument is about equality. But the author also points out that they take her to sushi four times a year, where they let her order expensive items while they stick to cheaper ones. So they're balancing things out in other ways.\n\nThe key here is whether splitting the pizza 50-50 is fair. The author's reasoning is based on physical size and appetite, which is a valid point. However, the wife's perspective is about equality in the relationship. But the author is already compensating in other areas by treating her to sushi. So maybe the pizza is just one part of their interactions, and the author isn't being unfair overall. The plan to let the wife eat her half first and then take some from her portion if they're still hungry might seem sneaky, but it's a way to avoid conflict. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't force the pizza on her; they ordered it with her permission. The wife's demand for half might come from a place of wanting fairness, but the author's approach is practical. Since they balance things in other ways, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. So the answer might be B.\n"
