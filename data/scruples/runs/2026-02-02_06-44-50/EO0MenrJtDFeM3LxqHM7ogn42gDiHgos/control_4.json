My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves pizza sharing between a husband and wife. The husband wants a 60-40 split because he's bigger and eats more, while the wife insists on 50-50. The husband plans to let her eat her half, then take the rest if she stops before finishing it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They have a mutual agreement where the wife allows him to buy pizza with a coupon. He also takes her to sushi four times a year, which shows he's making an effort to accommodate her. The wife's argument is about equality, but the husband thinks their physical needs differ. \n\nIs it fair to split based on body size? That's subjective. Some might say equality in relationships means equal shares regardless of appetite. Others might agree that physical differences should be considered. The husband's plan to take the leftover after she eats could be seen as manipulative. He's allowing her to eat first, then taking the rest, which might make her feel like he's being passive-aggressive. \n\nThe wife's insistence on half might be about fairness to her, but if she eats less, he's taking advantage. However, the husband is also trying to be considerate by bringing her to sushi places. The key here is whether the husband's approach is respectful. By letting her eat first and then taking the rest, he's not being upfront. Maybe he should communicate better instead of letting the situation play out. \n\nThe question is about being in the wrong. If the husband is using a tactic to get more pizza without a clear agreement, it might be his fault. The wife's expectation of equality could be valid, especially if they value equal sharing in their relationship. However, the husband's reasoning is about his needs. It's a balance between equality and individual needs. Since the husband is not being respectful of her terms and is planning to circumvent them, that could make him the asshole. The answer might be A.\n"
