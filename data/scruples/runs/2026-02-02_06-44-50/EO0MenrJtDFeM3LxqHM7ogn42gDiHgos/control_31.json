My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows.

I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's read through the situation again.\n\nThe author wants to order a pizza, which he does about four times a year. His wife doesn't like pizza because it's unhealthy and expensive in Japan. But he has a coupon and she gave him permission to buy it. The issue is splitting the pizza. He thinks a 60-40 split is fair because he's bigger and eats more, but she insists on a 50-50 split. He also mentions that he takes her to a nice sushi place four times a year where he orders cheap kid's menu while she can have the expensive ones. He's planning to let her eat her half until she's full, then he'll eat the rest of her half, leaving her with natto for breakfast instead of leftover pizza. He's asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nHmm. So the main points are about fairness in splitting food when there are differing needs or preferences. The wife wants equal halves, the husband thinks he should get more because he's bigger. The husband also mentions he compensates by taking her to sushi places where she can have more expensive options. \n\nFirst, is the husband right to think a 60-40 split is fair? Well, fairness can be subjective. In many relationships, people might expect equality in sharing meals, but there's also consideration for individual needs. If one partner is larger and eats more, maybe splitting unequally could be seen as fair. But some might argue that in a relationship, sharing equally is a sign of mutual respect and compromise, even if one's physical needs are different. The wife's insistence on half could be about equality in the relationship, not just physical consumption.\n\nThen there's the part about the sushi outings. The husband is compensating by taking her to nice places where she can indulge in her preferences, which suggests he's trying to balance things out. However, he's not taking her to expensive sushi every time, just four times a year, which matches his own pizza frequency. Maybe that's his way of showing he's making an effort to accommodate her tastes. \n\nBut the issue comes down to the pizza split. The husband's plan to let her eat her half and then take the rest might come off as manipulative or not respecting her wishes. Even if she eats less than half, he's taking advantage of her initial allocation. That could be seen as sneaky. The wife wanted half, and he's not honoring that agreement, which might be disrespectful. \n\nOn the other hand, if the husband's physical needs are genuine, maybe he's justified in needing more. But in a relationship, sometimes compromise is necessary. The wife's stance could be about equality in the relationship rather than just the meal. Maybe she feels that other times when they share meals, they should split equally, regardless of who eats more. \n\nThe husband's approach to the sushi might be different because sushi is a shared meal where they can order different things. With pizza, it's a shared item that's divided, so the method of splitting is more contentious. \n\nAnother angle: the husband is using the coupon and getting permission to order pizza. If the wife agreed to the purchase, maybe she also expected the split to be equal as part of the compromise. The husband's argument is about his body needing more, but the wife's argument is about being equals in the relationship. \n\nThere's also the part where he says he doesn't plan to feel bad about the leftovers situation. That might indicate he's not respecting her preferences or the agreement they made, which could make him the asshole. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might hinge on whether the husband's needs override the agreed-upon split. If the wife was clear about wanting half and he's going against that, even with a rationale, he's not respecting her wishes. Therefore, he might be in the wrong. But it's a bit of a gray area. However, the key is that she was given permission to get the pizza but under the condition that it's split equally. If he's breaching that agreement, then yes, he's in the wrong. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
