My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about dividing a pizza between them and their wife. The author ordered a pizza with a coupon, and the wife wants half each, but the author thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more. The author is also taking her to sushi four times a year, but he orders cheaper stuff while encouraging her to get the expensive ones.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the main points here. The wife's concern is about equality and maybe health or financial reasons. The author feels that his body size and eating habits justify getting more. The key is whether the author is being reasonable or if he's overstepping.\n\nThe wife gave permission to buy the pizza, so that's okay. But the division is the issue. The author's past actions include taking her to sushi, but he's choosing cheaper options for himself. Maybe there's an imbalance there. If he's already giving her expensive sushi while he gets cheaper, maybe expecting equal pizza isn't fair. But the author is arguing for 60-40, which could be seen as fair given their sizes. However, the wife's insistence on equality might be about fairness in sharing, not necessarily the quantity they eat. \n\nAlso, the author's plan to take leftovers from her half after she eats her fill seems sneaky. That could be where the problem lies. Even if he believes he's entitled, taking from her portion without agreement might be seen as dishonest. The wife might feel disrespected if he's not honoring the agreement she made. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to balance his preferences with her likes, like sushi. But maybe the pizza is a different scenario. The main conflict is about fairness based on personal needs versus equal sharing. \n\nIn relationships, fairness can be subjective. The wife might see equality as important, while the author sees it as proportional to their needs. The fact that the author is willing to take from her share after she's done might be the key issue here. It's about mutual respect and agreed-upon terms. If they can't agree on the split, maybe a compromise is needed, but the author's plan to go against her wishes could be seen as the asshole move.\n"
