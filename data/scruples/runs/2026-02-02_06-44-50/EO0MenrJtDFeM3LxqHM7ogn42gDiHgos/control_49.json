My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting a pizza with their wife.\n\nSo, the author ordered a pizza using a coupon with their wife's permission. The wife wants half each, but the author thinks 60-40 is fair because they eat more. The author also mentions they take her to sushi four times a year, which she likes, and they order cheaper for themselves. But the wife still wants half the pizza. The author plans to let her eat her half first, then take the leftovers.\n\nHmm, the key points here. First, the wife allowed the pizza because of the coupon. The author acknowledges her concerns about health and cost. The wife's insistence on equal halves might be about fairness, but the author feels it's not equal. However, the author's plan is to take the leftovers after she's done. That might be seen as a bit sneaky or unfair, even if they think they eat more. \n\nIn relationships, compromises are important. The wife might have different expectations of equality, maybe not just based on quantity but also on the fact that they're sharing. The author's past actions (like taking her to sushi) might be considered, but the pizza issue is about the split. If they agreed to share the pizza, maybe the wife expects that agreement to be honored. The author's plan to take her leftovers could be seen as disrespectful, even if they don't think they're in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because they agreed to share, and taking the leftovers after she eats her half might not be fair. The wife's reasoning for equality might be valid, and the author's approach could be manipulative.\n"
