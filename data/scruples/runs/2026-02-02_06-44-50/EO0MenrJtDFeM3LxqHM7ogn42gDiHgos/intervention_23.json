My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting a pizza with their wife. The husband wants 60% because he's bigger and eats more, while the wife insists on splitting it 50-50. He argues that since they're equal, she expects half. He mentions that he also takes her to sushi places but eats cheap, and she eats expensive. He plans to let her eat her share, then take the rest if she's done.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the fairness of their argument. The key points: the husband is bigger, eats more, but the wife is insisting on equal division. The husband is okay with her eating less and then taking the remaining. But is that fair?\n\nIn relationships, equality doesn't always mean equal division of everything. It's more about mutual respect and consideration. If the husband is eating more, maybe a 60-40 split is reasonable. However, the wife's insistence on half might be based on her own preferences or health reasons. The husband's plan to take her leftovers if she's full might be seen as taking advantage, even if he's not forcing her to eat less. \n\nAlso, the husband's approach might hurt her feelings. If he's going to do that, maybe he should communicate better. The fact that he's planning to ignore her stated half if she doesn't finish could be seen as dismissive. The wife might feel her rules aren't respected. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband is being considerate in other ways, like taking her to sushi and letting her have expensive dishes. That shows he's trying to balance things. But the pizza issue is about personal preference and needs. The husband's argument is about physical needs, which is valid, but the wife's insistence on equality might be about fairness in their relationship dynamics. \n\nIs it the husband's fault? Well, if he's not respecting her wishes, even if they're not fair to him, then maybe he's in the wrong. But if the wife is being unreasonable, then he's not. The user thinks he's in the wrong, but I need to decide.\n\nThe husband's plan to take her leftovers if she's done is a bit sneaky and might not be respectful. The wife might feel like her boundaries are being ignored. In a relationship, compromise is key. If he's willing to adjust, maybe a 60-40 split is fair, but he's planning to ignore her half, which could be seen as inconsiderate. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because he's not respecting her terms even though he's offering a compromise. The answer might be A.\n"
