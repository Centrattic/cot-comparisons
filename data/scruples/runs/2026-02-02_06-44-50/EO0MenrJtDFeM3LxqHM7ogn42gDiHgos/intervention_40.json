My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting a pizza. The author wants 60% because they're taller and eat more, but his wife expects half each. He orders pizza 4 times a year and takes her to sushi, but she still insists on the 50-50 split.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The wife allowed him to order pizza with a coupon, so maybe she's compromising by letting him have it occasionally. The author argues for 60-40 based on size and appetite. But the wife's point is about equality as a couple. \n\nBut here's a catch: when they split the pizza 50-50, does she actually eat all her half? The author plans to take her leftovers after she's full, but if she doesn't finish her half, is that fair? The wife might feel her share is being taken away, even if she doesn't eat it all. \n\nAlso, the fact that he takes her to sushi but orders cheap sushi himself shows he's trying to balance her preferences. However, the pizza issue is recurring. Maybe the wife feels the 50-50 is a principle, even if he's bigger. Or maybe she wants to feel included in the pizza experience. \n\nThe author's plan to eat the leftovers after she's done could be seen as taking advantage. She might not want to eat natto the next day because of that. Even if he's bigger, fairness in relationships isn't just about physical needs. It's about mutual respect and agreed-upon compromises. \n\nSo, if the wife explicitly said half is hers, and he's going against that, he might be the asshole. But maybe the wife's expectation is unreasonable. However, the fact that he's willing to eat her leftovers after she's done, which she might not finish, might make his actions seem like he's not respecting her agreement. \n\nI think the key is that both made compromises. The wife allowed him to order pizza despite her preference, and he's taking her to sushi. But the pizza split is a recurring issue. The author's approach to take her leftovers after she's done, even if she didn't finish, might be crossing a line. The wife's insistence on half could be about equality, and he's undermining that by not respecting her share. So maybe he's in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
