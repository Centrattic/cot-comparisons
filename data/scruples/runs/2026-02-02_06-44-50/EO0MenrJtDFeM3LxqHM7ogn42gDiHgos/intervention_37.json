My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about dividing a pizza between a husband and wife.\n\nFirst, the husband wants to order a pizza, but his wife has some concerns about health and cost. He got a coupon and she allowed him to order it. He wants a large pizza because he likes to eat a lot, not for value. The issue is the division: he thinks 60-40 based on their sizes, but she wants 50-50. He's planning to let her eat her half, but if she doesn't finish it, he'll eat the rest. He also mentions he takes her to a nice sushi place where he encourages her to order expensive items while he eats cheaper ones. \n\nSo, the core of the problem is about fairness in sharing. The wife wants equality, each getting half. The husband thinks it should be based on their physical needs. But how do we determine if he's wrong? \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, splitting things equally is often considered just, especially in a relationship where equality is valued. The husband's argument is about body size and eating more, but that might not justify unequal sharing when it's a shared meal. Also, the wife's preference for equality might be a personal boundary. The husband's plan to take the leftover half after she eats her fill could be seen as undermining her wishes. Even if she eats less, he's taking what she didn't finish, which she might not agree with. \n\nThe husband also mentions that he encourages her to spend more on sushi when they go out, but that's a different context. He's being generous there, but with the pizza, he's not respecting her division. The key here is whether respecting each other's preferences and boundaries is more important than the logic of body size. Since the wife has a clear expectation of equality, and the husband is planning to ignore that, it might be seen as the husband being in the wrong. \n\nBut maybe there's a counterpoint. If the pizza is part of his treat (since he ordered it with a coupon and she allowed it), maybe he should have more. However, they are sharing the meal, so it's a joint effort. The problem is the husband's insistence on 60-40 despite her objections. The wife's point is about equality in the relationship. The husband's plan to take the leftover might also be seen as sneaky, which could be disrespectful. \n\nSo overall, the husband is not respecting his wife's wishes, which could be considered wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A, he's in the wrong.\n"
