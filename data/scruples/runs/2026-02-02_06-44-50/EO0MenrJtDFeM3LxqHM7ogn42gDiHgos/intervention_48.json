My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting a pizza with their wife. The author wants a 60-40 split because he's taller and eats more, but his wife insists on 50-50. He argues that they are equal, but he's bigger, so more pizza is fair. The wife doesn't like pizza as much, so maybe she's okay with less.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the concept of equality versus equity. The wife is pushing for equal halves, which is about equality\u2014each gets the same amount. The author is suggesting equity\u2014adjusting based on their needs or sizes. But the wife might not want pizza at all, which complicates things. If she's taking half even if she doesn't eat it, maybe he's right to think it's unfair. But he's planning to take her half after she's done eating, which could be seen as manipulative. He's using her declared portion, which might not be fair if she eats her half and he takes the rest. That could make her feel disrespected. \n\nAlso, the fact that he orders pizza 4 times a year and takes her to sushi the same number of times shows he tries to accommodate her preferences. But he mentions he orders cheap plates for himself and encourages her to get expensive ones. Maybe there's a pattern of him making sacrifices for her, so expecting a different split on pizza could be seen as selfish. \n\nThe key points: Is it fair to split resources based on physical size or not? Does the wife's insistence on equal portions, even if she doesn't eat them all, take away his right to his preferred portion? Also, his plan to take her leftover half might not be fair to her, leading to her missing out on breakfast. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and compromise are important. If the wife has agreed to let him order pizza, maybe she expects to have her share. The author's approach might be seen as undermining her autonomy. Even if she eats less, he taking her portion might be considered inconsiderate. \n\nSo, the author's reasoning is based on physical needs, but the wife's stance is about equality. The problem is the author's plan to take her leftovers without her consent might be the issue. Therefore, he might be in the wrong because he's not respecting her right to her portion, even if he thinks she's taking more than she'll eat. The answer could be A (in the wrong).\n"
