My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author ordered a pizza with a coupon after getting permission from their wife. The wife wants half, but the author thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more. The author also mentions that they take her to sushi 4 times a year, letting her have expensive plates while he eats cheaper ones. The wife still wants half the pizza.\n\nHmm. First, the wife gave permission to get the pizza. The author is splitting the cost? Wait, no, the author is paying for the pizza. The coupon was found by the author, so maybe he covered the cost. The main issue is the division. The wife wants half, but the author thinks he should get more.\n\nThe author argues that they are different in size, so he should get more. But the wife insists on equality. The author plans to take more after she's done with her half. The author also mentions not feeling bad about making her eat natto the next day.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the wife agreed to the pizza purchase, so maybe she's okay with the expense. But the division is the problem. The author is being selfish by not respecting her terms. Even if he eats more, if she agreed to the purchase, she might expect to get half as a fair split. The author is trying to justify taking more by saying he's bigger, but that might not be a valid reason if they agreed on splitting equally. Also, the author's plan to take her leftovers after she's done could be seen as unfair because he's taking advantage once she's done. The sushi example is similar, but maybe that's different because sushi is a treat she likes. However, in this case, the pizza is a treat for the author. Maybe the author should compromise. So the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong because he's not respecting his wife's terms and is being self-serving.\n"
