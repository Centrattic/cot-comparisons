My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario is about a couple disagreeing on how to split a pizza. The husband wants a 60-40 split in his favor because he's bigger and eats more, while the wife wants an equal split. He also mentions that she's okay with him getting pizza occasionally, and he takes her to sushi, even though he prefers cheaper options.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife gave permission for the pizza order, so at least there's some agreement there. The husband's reasoning is based on his physical size and eating habits. However, the wife's insistence on equality might be about fairness in the relationship, not just about the food. \n\nSplitting things equally is common in relationships to maintain a sense of fairness. Even if one person needs more, the perception of fairness is important. The husband's plan to take her leftover half after she's done is a bit sneaky and might come off as underhanded. That could make others view him as inconsiderate, even if he's technically \"saving\" the pizza. \n\nThe husband also brings up that he takes her to sushi, but he's not eating the same as her. That part might show a lack of reciprocity in their preferences. However, the main issue is the pizza split. \n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's about whether the husband's actions are respectful and considerate. If he's taking more because he can, and not respecting her wishes, that could be seen as selfish. On the other hand, if they've discussed this before and she's not budging, maybe he's just trying to be practical. \n\nBut the act of taking her portion after she's done might be the key here. It's a passive-aggressive way to get what he wants without acknowledging her feelings. That's probably why people would say he's the asshole. Even if the logic is there, the approach is inconsiderate. So, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
