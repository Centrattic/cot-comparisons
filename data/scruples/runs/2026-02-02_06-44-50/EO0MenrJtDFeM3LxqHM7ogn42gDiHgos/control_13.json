My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting more than half the pizza. The situation is that the husband ordered a pizza using a coupon his wife allowed him to use. He wants 60% for himself because he's bigger and eats more, while the wife insists on splitting it 50-50. The husband argues that their equal split isn't fair given their different appetites, and he mentions he takes her to sushi often, so he feels entitled.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife gave permission to order the pizza, which suggests she's not against the act itself. The dispute is about the division. The husband's reasoning is based on physical size and eating habits, which could be seen as a practical approach. However, the wife's insistence on equality might stem from a principle of fairness or not wanting to feel like she's being shortchanged, even if she doesn't eat as much.\n\nThe husband's plan to take more after she's done eating her half might be seen as manipulative. By letting her eat first and then taking the leftovers, he's technically not violating her rule but is still taking more. This could lead to resentment. The key here is mutual respect and communication. The husband could have discussed his needs more clearly or found a compromise, like varying the split on different occasions. \n\nThe wife might feel that equality in sharing is important for their relationship, even if it's not based on consumption. The husband's approach might come across as entitled or not considering her feelings. Even though he's bigger, fairness in relationships often involves more than just physical needs. The husband's past actions, like encouraging her to enjoy sushi more, might not fully offset the pizza issue. \n\nIn the AITA context, the community often values consideration and compromise. The husband's plan to outsmart her by taking leftovers might not be seen as fair play, even if he's within the rules. The wife's perspective is that she agreed to the pizza, so splitting it equally is her condition. The husband's insistence on 60-40 without mutual agreement could be seen as disregarding her wishes. So, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not respecting the agreed-upon terms and is being manipulative.\n"
