My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband and wife who have a disagreement about splitting a pizza. The husband ordered pizza using a coupon that the wife allowed, but she wants half the pizza each. He argues that since he's taller, bigger, and eats more, a 60/40 split is fair. However, he plans to let her eat her half first and then take the remaining leftovers, even if that means she has to eat natto for breakfast the next day.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The wife is okay with the pizza being ordered as a special treat, given the coupon and the context of their shared meal. She's asking for half, which is a 50/50 split. The husband, on the other hand, wants 60% for himself. He's not justifying it based on cost or frequency but on his body size and eating habits. However, he mentions that he takes her to a nice sushi place four times a year, where he encourages her to order expensive items while he gets cheaper ones. This suggests he's making an effort to cater to her preferences in other meals, which might balance out the pizza situation.\n\nThe husband's plan is to let her eat her half first, and then he'll take the leftovers. But his intention is to take more than half, even if she doesn't finish hers. That could be seen as manipulative because he's setting up a scenario where he gets more by default. The wife might feel her share is being taken away if she doesn't eat all of it, which isn't fair. Also, the fact that he's okay with her having natto for breakfast instead of leftover pizza adds a layer of being dismissive of her choice, perhaps implying that she's being unreasonable.\n\nIn relationships, fairness and respect are important. Even though the husband is eating more, the wife's request for half the pizza is about equality in the meal. The husband's argument is based on physical needs, but meals can also be about shared experiences and compromise. The fact that he's planning to take advantage of the situation where she might not finish her half shows a lack of consideration for her feelings. The key here is that the wife was given permission to have the pizza, and her share was agreed upon. The husband's actions undermine that agreement, making him the asshole by being dishonest and taking more than his share through manipulation.\n"
