My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about splitting a pizza between a husband and wife. The husband wants 60% for himself because he's bigger and eats more, while the wife insists on splitting it evenly. The husband plans to take more of her half after she's done eating.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The wife allowed him to order pizza with a coupon, but she wants half. The husband feels that because he's taller and eats more, 60-40 is fair. He also mentions that he takes her to a nice sushi place four times a year, where he eats cheaper options so she can have the better ones. So there's a pattern of him sacrificing for her, and he expects some reciprocity in the pizza sharing.\n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. Let's consider fairness and equality in relationships. The wife's stance is that they should be equal, so half each. The husband argues for a different split based on his physical needs. The problem is that splitting a pizza isn't like splitting a meal where both can customize. Pizza is a shared item, so splitting it 50-50 is a common practice to avoid conflict. \n\nThe husband's plan to take more from her portion after she's done seems a bit manipulative. Even if she eats less, he's using her initial allocation to get more for himself. That could be seen as not respecting her agreement. Also, the wife allowed the pizza order, which might imply an understanding that they would share it, not that he'd take more. \n\nThe husband's argument about being fair based on body size is subjective. While it's true that he might need more food, expecting a specific split without mutual agreement could be problematic. The wife's insistence on equality might be her way of ensuring fairness in their shared expenses and consumption. The husband's previous sacrifices (like sushi) might be balanced by pizza here. \n\nAnother angle is communication. The husband has brought up the 60-40 split before, but she still wants half. Maybe he should respect her boundary even if he disagrees. The plan to take more from her half after she eats sounds like he's not honoring her wishes, which could lead to resentment. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's preferences and agreements is important. Even if he feels his way is fair, if the wife has a different view, he might need to compromise. The husband's approach here seems to undermine her wishes, making him the asshole. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he's disregarding his wife's wishes and using a manipulative plan to get more pizza, which isn't respecting her agreement to split it evenly."
