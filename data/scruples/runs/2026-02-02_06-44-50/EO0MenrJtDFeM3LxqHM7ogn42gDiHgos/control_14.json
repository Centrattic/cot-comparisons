My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about splitting a pizza between a husband and wife. The wife allows him to order pizza because he found a coupon, but she insists on splitting it 50-50. The husband argues that since he's bigger and eats more, a 60-40 split is fair. He also mentions that he takes her to sushi places where he encourages her to order more expensive items while he sticks to cheaper ones. The wife still wants half the pizza for herself, and the husband plans to take more than half after she's done eating her half.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are expectations, fairness, and mutual respect in a relationship. The wife gave permission to order the pizza, so that's a starting point. The author is arguing that his larger size and appetite justify a bigger share. However, fairness in a relationship isn't just about physical size; it's also about mutual understanding and compromise.\n\nThe author mentions that the wife has \"repeatedly demanded\" a 50-50 split, even though they're supposed to be equals. The husband's reasoning is based on the idea that they have different needs. But in relationships, equality often means treating each other with respect and considering each other's preferences and feelings, not just splitting things based on physical attributes. The fact that the husband plans to let her eat her half first and then take the remaining might be seen as a way to get around her wishes, which could be viewed as manipulative.\n\nAdditionally, the husband's argument about the sushi outings\u2014where he encourages her to order expensive items while he eats cheaper ones\u2014might be trying to show that he's willing to let her have more in other contexts. However, the wife might not see the pizza split the same way. The key here is whether the husband is respecting her request. If the wife has clearly stated her expectation, and he's not honoring it, that could be the issue. The husband's plan to take more than half after she eats her portion could be seen as undermining her autonomy in the matter.\n\nSo, the question is whether expecting a 60-40 split is reasonable. In relationships, it's important to negotiate and find a middle ground. If the wife is uncomfortable with anything less than 50-50, then the husband's insistence on a different ratio might be disregarding her feelings. The husband's approach of letting her eat her half first and then taking more might also be seen as not being honest about the initial split, which could hurt the trust or mutual respect in the relationship.\n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because he's not respecting his wife's wishes and is planning to take more than she's agreed to, even if he rationalizes it. The wife's request is about equality, and the husband's actions could be perceived as selfish, even if he's justifying it based on size and appetite."
