My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about splitting a pizza between a husband and wife. The husband wants a 60-40 split in his favor, while the wife wants half each. The author is asking if he's the asshole for expecting more than half.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife allowed him to order pizza because he found a coupon and it's expensive in Japan. He orders it once a year, and he also takes her to sushi four times a year, encouraging her to order expensive dishes. So there's some balance in their shared expenses and preferences.\n\nThe husband argues that he's bigger and eats more, so 60-40 is fair. The wife insists on equal halves because they're supposed to be equals. The husband plans to let her eat her half, then take the rest once she's done, even though he knows she'll have to eat natto for breakfast instead of leftover pizza. He doesn't feel bad about it.\n\nNow, thinking about fairness and relationships. In relationships, compromise is often key. The wife's stance is about equality, which is a common value. The husband's argument is about physical needs. However, pizza is a shared meal, so splitting it equally might be expected even if their appetites differ. By taking her half after she's done, he's not respecting her right to that portion, even if she doesn't finish it. That could be seen as selfish. The wife might feel her needs are being disregarded, even if she eats less. The husband might be overstepping by taking more without her consent, undermining the agreement to split it. The fact that he's doing it every year but only argues about the split might make it seem like he's being consistent, but it still doesn't necessarily make it right. The core issue is about mutual respect and agreed-upon sharing. So the author is in the wrong because he's not respecting the agreed split and is taking more than his share by default, even if he thinks it's justified.\n"
