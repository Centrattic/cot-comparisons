My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is the asshole in this situation where they're splitting a pizza. The author ordered a pizza with a coupon, and the wife says it's 50-50. The author thinks since they're bigger and eat more, 60-40 is fair. But the wife keeps insisting on half.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points. The main issue is about the fairness of splitting the pizza. The author argues based on size and appetite, while the wife is pushing for equality. The author also mentions that this isn't a regular thing\u2014only four times a year. They even go out of their way to take her to sushi places, which she likes, but he prefers kid's menu. So he's making sacrifices there.\n\nNow, the question is whether expecting 60-40 is wrong. The wife wants equality, which is a common value in relationships. But the author is saying that because he eats more, he should get a larger portion. Is that a valid argument? Maybe in some contexts, but splitting food 50-50 is often about equal sharing regardless of size or appetite. The wife might feel that since both of them are eating, it's fair to split it evenly. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is willing to let her eat her fill first, then take the rest. That's a bit of a passive-aggressive way to handle it. The wife gave permission for him to buy the pizza, so maybe she expected a fair share. If he takes more by this method, she might end up not getting enough and he's planning to do that, which could be seen as manipulative.\n\nAlso, the author's plan to let her eat her declared half first and then take the rest implies he's not being upfront. Maybe a better approach would be to discuss and agree on a different split, but he's going behind her back. That's probably not the healthiest way to handle it. \n\nThe sushi part shows he's trying to be considerate of her preferences, but he's using that as a counterpoint. However, the pizza situation is different because it's something he loves and she's okay with him having it occasionally. Still, her expectation of equal division might be about not feeling like she's being taken advantage of, even if it's a rare occurrence. \n\nIn terms of social norms, splitting things 50-50 when both are sharing is pretty standard. Unless there's a prior agreement, taking more without consent could be seen as selfish. The author's argument about physical size might not hold in a relationship where equality is a mutual expectation. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not being inconsiderate in wanting to enjoy pizza, but the way he's handling the split might be. The wife's stance is about equality, and the author's plan to circumvent that could be the issue. Therefore, the answer might be A because he's not respecting her agreement and is planning to take more without negotiation. But I also need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. Maybe the author's point is valid if he's eating more, but in a shared purchase, the default is usually sharing equally. So yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
