My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The question is about dividing a pizza between a husband and wife.\n\nFirst, the husband ordered a pizza using a coupon with the wife's permission. The wife wants half each, but the husband thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more. The wife insists on equality, and the husband plans to let her eat her half, then take the rest once she's full. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants another opinion.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about fairness and equality in a relationship. The wife's reasoning is based on equality, splitting things 50-50 as a sign of being equal partners. The husband argues for a split based on physical size and eating habits. However, in relationships, especially between partners, equality often isn't about splitting things equally in quantity but about mutual respect and compromise. The husband's plan to take more after allowing her to eat her half might come off as manipulative or not respecting her boundaries. Even if she eats less, taking the remaining part he's \"allowed\" could be seen as undermining her decision. \n\nAlso, the husband mentions that he takes her to a nice sushi place four times a year, but he orders cheap plates while she gets expensive ones. That shows he's willing to adjust his preferences for her, which he might expect her to reciprocate. However, the pizza situation is different because it's his treat, and he's the one who initiated it. The wife's insistence on equal sharing might be about fairness in their shared expenses and resources, not just the pizza itself. \n\nThe husband's approach could be seen as being inconsiderate, even if he's technically not forcing her to eat less. The fact that he's planning to take advantage of the situation where she might not finish her half shows a lack of respect for her agreement. The core issue is whether the husband is respecting the terms of their agreement (her half, his half) even if the outcome isn't what he expected. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is important, but so is respecting each other's terms. The wife's stance is about equality, and the husband's counter is about personal needs. The problem arises when the husband's actions don't honor the agreed-upon split, even if he thinks he can get away with it. So the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because he's not respecting the agreed division and is planning to take more without considering her feelings.\n"
