My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong regarding a pizza-sharing situation with their wife.\n\nFirst, the context: The husband wants to order a pizza he loves, but his wife is against it because of health and cost. He got a coupon and she allowed him to buy it. However, she insists on splitting it 50-50, which he thinks is unfair since he's bigger and eats more. He wants a 60-40 split. He's planning to let her eat her half first and then take what's left, even if she ends up with leftovers the next day. \n\nNow, considering fairness and equality in relationships. The wife's argument is about equality, each getting half. The husband's reasoning is based on physical size and appetite. But equality doesn't always mean strict 50-50; it's about mutual respect and consideration. However, the husband's plan sounds like he's trying to undermine her agreement by taking more without her consent. \n\nHe mentions he takes her to sushi four times a year, but he orders cheap while she can have expensive. Maybe he's trying to balance the giving, but that doesn't directly relate to the pizza split. The key issue is that the wife agreed to the pizza on the condition of splitting it, and he's not honoring that. \n\nCheating or manipulating the agreement, even if he thinks he's being fair, could be seen as disrespectful. The husband's approach of letting her eat first and then taking the rest is a way to circumvent the agreed split. That's not good. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is important. If the wife insists on half, maybe the husband could find a middle ground, like having two smaller pizzas or adjusting portions differently. But his plan is to go behind her back, which is problematic. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Probably yes. Even if his reasoning is based on personal needs, he's not respecting her terms. The wife's condition was part of the compromise for allowing the pizza. Disregarding that could be seen as dishonest or inconsiderate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
