My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about dividing a pizza they ordered with a coupon. The wife says half is hers, but the author thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the context. The author's wife was against ordering pizza because it's unhealthy and expensive. He found a coupon and she allowed him to buy it. Now, he wants to have 60% because he eats more, but she's insisting on equal halves. The author plans to let her eat her fill first, then take the rest of her half if he's still hungry. He doesn't want to feel bad if she ends up with leftovers the next day instead of pizza.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about fairness and mutual understanding. The wife agreed to the pizza purchase, so maybe the issue is about how they split it. The author argues that his body size and appetite justify a bigger share. But the wife might feel that since they both agreed to the order, it should be split equally. \n\nBut wait, the author mentions he takes her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, and he encourages her to order expensive plates. That seems like he's making an effort to accommodate her tastes. In return, maybe she feels entitled to equal sharing when he orders something she's okay with. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is justifying taking more based on his physical needs. Is it fair to assume equal portions in a shared meal? Some people might think that's a given, others might see it as splitting based on needs. The author's plan to take more from her half after she's full could be seen as manipulative or taking advantage. That might make others think he's being a bit selfish, even if he's considering her preferences in other areas.\n\nI should also consider cultural aspects. In Japan, where the story is set, maybe there's a different norm about sharing food. But the wife is expecting equality, which is a common concept in many relationships. The author's reasoning is based on personal consumption, but if he's only ordering pizza 4 times a year, maybe it's about personal preference rather than necessity. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for expecting more than half. The wife's insistence on half is her way of feeling equal, perhaps. The author's approach of letting her eat first and then taking the rest might not be fair. If he's taking more after she's done, it's not really 50-50. So, maybe the answer is A, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, if the wife agreed to the purchase, the author could argue that he should get his fair share based on his needs. But the problem is the expectation of equality. The wife might not be against the pizza itself but the division. The author's solution could lead to her not getting her desired share since he's taking from her portion. That might be seen as the asshole move. \n\nSo, probably the author is in the wrong because he's not respecting the agreed-upon split and is planning to take more, which could make the wife feel her needs aren't being considered. The answer is A.\n"
