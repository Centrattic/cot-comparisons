My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the pizza-sharing dilemma is in the wrong. So the situation is that the author wants to have a pizza, but his wife wants to split it evenly, 50-50. The author thinks it's fair to split it 60-40 in his favor because he's bigger and eats more. He also mentions that he orders pizza four times a year and takes her to sushi four times a year, but he usually gets the cheaper kid's menu items, letting her have the more expensive ones. She still insists on half the pizza.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives here. The author's argument is based on physical differences\u2014being taller and bigger, so needing more food. But his wife is pushing for equality, which is a common approach in relationships where both partners are considered equal. The author's plan is to let her eat her half, then take the rest once she's done. That seems sneaky. He admits he doesn't feel bad about making her eat natto instead of leftover pizza the next day. That's a bit manipulative, maybe.\n\nNow, in terms of fairness, some might say sharing 50-50 is fair because they are equal partners regardless of body size. Others might agree that if one person eats more, they should take a larger portion. But the key here is mutual respect and communication. The wife has given permission to order the pizza because of the coupon, but maybe she expected a fair split as part of that compromise. The author is not respecting her terms, which might be seen as undermining her autonomy. He's also not considering her feelings by planning to take back the pizza after she's done, which could be seen as deceitful.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's doing something nice by taking her to sushi, but he's choosing cheaper options for himself while she gets the expensive ones. However, the pizza situation is different. The wife might feel that since he's indulging in pizza only a few times a year, he should share it equally. The author's plan to take advantage after she's full is a bit underhanded, even if he believes it's justified. In relationships, respecting each other's boundaries and agreements is important. If he agreed to her terms to get permission, maybe he shouldn't go back on that. So, while the 60-40 might make sense to him, the way he's handling the situation could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not honoring the agreed-upon split, even if he has a different opinion on fairness.\n"
