My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the pizza question is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the scenario again to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nSo, the author wants to order a pizza because he loves it, and he has a coupon. His wife agreed to let him order it, but she wants half the pizza each. He feels that 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more. He's been bringing this up before, but she insists on splitting it 50-50. He also mentions that he takes her to a nice sushi place four times a year, even though he prefers cheaper options. He plans to let her eat until she's full, which he thinks will be less than half, and then he'll eat the rest. The question is whether he's the asshole.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the key points here. The wife agreed to the pizza order, so that's a start. The author feels his body size and appetite justify a 60-40 split. The wife, on the other hand, believes in equality, hence 50-50. The author's plan is to let her eat her half until she's full, then take the rest. He also mentions that he's considerate by taking her to sushi places, even though he doesn't like the expensive ones.\n\nNow, the main issue is about fairness in the division. The author argues that his physical needs make 60-40 fair. The wife wants equal portions. The question is whether the author's reasoning is valid or if he's being selfish.\n\nI think consent is a big part here. The wife agreed to the pizza order because of the coupon and the expense. But she expected a 50-50 split. The author is now trying to renege on that agreement by using his size and appetite as a reason. Even if he eats more, the agreement was for the pizza to be shared. By going back on that, he might be overstepping. \n\nAlso, his plan to take her half after she's full seems manipulative. She might feel pressured to eat until she's full just to keep her portion, which could be uncomfortable. Plus, he's mentioned that this isn't a regular occurrence\u2014only four times a year. So maybe the wife's compromise is reasonable given the infrequency.\n\nThe fact that he's also considerate by taking her to sushi places might balance things out, but the core issue is the agreement they made. If he agreed to 50-50, even if he later changes his mind, it's about respecting her wishes. She might feel disrespected if he doesn't honor the split she expected.\n\nAnother angle: communication. He's brought this up before, and she's insisted on 50-50. Maybe he should have negotiated a different arrangement from the start instead of expecting her to agree to his 60-40 now. Since she's repeatedly demanded the 50-50, he might need to respect that to maintain harmony in the relationship.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's argument for 60-40 is based on his physical needs, but the wife's request for equality is about fairness in the relationship. The author is possibly prioritizing his own needs over her expectations, which could be seen as inconsiderate. His plan to take her portion after she's full might be a way to get more without directly violating their agreement, but it's still not honoring the original split she wanted. \n\nTherefore, I think the author is in the wrong because he's not respecting the agreed-upon split and is being manipulative about it. The answer would be A.\n"
