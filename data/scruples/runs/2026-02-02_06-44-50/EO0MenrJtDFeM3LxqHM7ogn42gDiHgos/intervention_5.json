My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple arguing over how to split a pizza. The husband wants 60% because he's taller and eats more, while the wife insists on 50-50 because of equality. The husband also mentions that he takes her to sushi 4 times a year, but he eats cheap, and she gets the expensive stuff. He plans to let her eat her half until she's full and then take the rest, even if she ends up with natto for breakfast instead of leftovers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The wife allowed him to order pizza with a coupon because she values his comfort (a taste from home). He agreed to buy a large pizza, but the split is an issue. The wife wants equal halves. The husband argues that his body type requires more. But the wife's stance is about equality. \n\nNow, equality in relationships is often about fairness and mutual respect. The wife's argument is about equal sharing, which could be seen as promoting fairness. The husband's counter is based on physical needs, but that might not be the main point here. The wife might see 50-50 as a way to ensure they both get what they want, especially since he's compromising by ordering pizza, which she's against due to health and cost. \n\nThe husband's plan to take the leftover half after she's done seems underhanded. Even if he's letting her eat first, taking her remaining half might be seen as not respecting her choice. The wife might feel like he's being sneaky or not honest. The fact that he's going to make her have natto instead of pizza leftovers could be seen as a petty revenge. \n\nAlso, the husband mentions that he takes her to sushi 4 times a year, but he eats cheap, and she gets the expensive stuff. However, the pizza situation is different because she's already allowing him to get pizza, which she's against. The sushi is a treat for her, but here, the pizza is a compromise. \n\nThe key issue here is about respecting each other's preferences and the agreed-upon compromise. The wife allowed the pizza purchase, possibly under the condition of equal sharing. The husband's plan to take more than half after she's done could be seen as breaking that agreement, even if he's doing it in a way that's not direct. \n\nIn relationships, fairness isn't always about exact physical needs but about the perception of fairness and respect. The wife might feel that 50-50 is fair because it's a shared activity, and the husband's insistence on 60-40 is a form of entitlement based on his body. However, the husband's argument about his size is a real consideration, but maybe not the most important one here. \n\nThe husband's actions might be seen as inconsiderate because he's not respecting her terms. The wife's request for half is a way to ensure she gets her share, which he's circumventing. The fact that he's planning to make her have natto instead of leftovers adds to the perception that he's being inconsiderate. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions, while perhaps based on a practical argument (his eating more), might be seen as not respecting the agreed-upon terms and the wife's wishes. Therefore, he could be in the wrong.\n"
