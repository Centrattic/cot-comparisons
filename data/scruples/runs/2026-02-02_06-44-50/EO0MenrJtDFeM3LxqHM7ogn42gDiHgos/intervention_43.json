My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about splitting a pizza between the author and his wife. The author wants 60% for himself because he's taller and eats more, but his wife insists on 50-50. The question is whether he's being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, the wife gave him permission to buy the pizza with a coupon, which shows she's okay with the expense. The author is getting the pizza because he likes it as a taste from home, and he also treats her to sushi. So there's a mutual exchange here. The wife might feel that because he's allowing her sushi, he should also share the pizza equally.\n\nThe author argues that his body size justifies a larger portion. But in many cultures, splitting food equally is seen as fair, even if one person eats more. It's about fairness and compromise in a relationship. The author's plan to take more after the wife is done eating might come off as sneaky or unfair. If he's planning to take advantage of her eating habits to get more, that could be seen as selfish.\n\nAlso, the wife's insistence on equality might be about respecting each other's preferences, not just quantity. Maybe the author should accommodate her request for fairness, even if he doesn't strictly need more. The author's approach could be hurting the wife's feelings or making her feel unappreciated. Relationships often require giving up some personal preferences for harmony. So, the author might be in the wrong here by not respecting her desire for equal division despite their different appetites.\n"
