My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. So the user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple where the husband wants to order pizza, but the wife insists on splitting it 50-50. He argues that he's bigger and eats more, so he thinks a 60-40 split is fair. The question is whether he's the asshole (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The husband ordered pizza and got permission from his wife, but she wants half. He feels that's unfair because of their body sizes. He also mentions that he takes her to sushi places where he eats cheaper, and she gets expensive dishes. So he's trying to balance their preferences, but the pizza split is an issue.\n\nThe key points here are about fairness and mutual respect. The wife might feel that splitting equally is fair because they both have to share the meal. The husband, on the other hand, is arguing based on physical needs. But is it reasonable to expect a different split in a shared meal? In many relationships, sharing equally is a common approach, even if one person eats more. It's about compromise and not making the other person feel they're not being treated fairly.\n\nAlso, the husband's plan to eat the remaining pizza after she's done might be seen as resentful or not respecting her wishes. If she's agreed to the pizza, but expects half, not honoring that could lead to conflict. Even if he ends up eating more in the end, the act of going against her stated expectation might be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nMoreover, the wife's insistence on equality could be about more than just the pizza. It might be a principle of fairness in their relationship. The husband might be dismissing her feelings by not respecting her 50-50 split, even if he has a logical argument. Relationships often require giving in on small things for the sake of harmony. \n\nSo, while the husband has his reasons, the expectation of equal sharing might be more about maintaining a sense of partnership. Therefore, the husband might be in the wrong for not respecting his wife's wishes despite his own reasoning.\n"
