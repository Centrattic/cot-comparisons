My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario is about a couple's disagreement over splitting a pizza.\n\nFirst, the wife allowed him to order pizza because he found a coupon. He wants to have more than half because he's bigger and eats more. She insists on splitting it 50-50. The author plans to let her eat her half first, take some of it, and leave her with natto for breakfast. He's questioning if he's the asshole for doing that.\n\nSo, the key points here are: mutual understanding and compromise. The wife agreed to the pizza because of the coupon, but the split is an issue. The author argues based on size and metabolism, which might be reasonable, but the wife sees it as equality. The author's plan to take more than her half after she's done eating seems underhanded. Even if they agreed to 50-50, he's going to take more, which could be seen as dishonest. Also, the natto part is a bit harsh, implying she'll miss out, which might be unfair. The wife might feel her wishes are being disregarded. The author's reasoning is based on personal needs, but respecting a prior agreement is important in relationships. So, the author's actions, even if he feels justified, might be inconsiderate. Therefore, he could be in the wrong.\n"
