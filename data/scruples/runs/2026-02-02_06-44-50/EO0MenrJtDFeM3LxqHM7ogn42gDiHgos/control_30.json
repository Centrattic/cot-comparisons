My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about splitting a pizza between him and his wife. The author wants 60% for himself and 40% for his wife because he's taller, bigger, and eats more. His wife insists on splitting it 50-50, saying they should be equal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author ordered a pizza using a coupon his wife allowed. He acknowledges that pizza is unhealthy and expensive in Japan, but it's a taste from his home country. He also mentions that he takes her to a nice sushi place four times a year, even though he prefers kid's menu items, encouraging her to get the more expensive ones she likes. So there's some give and take here.\n\nThe wife's reasoning for 50-50 is about equality, while the author's is based on their physical needs. The author plans to let her eat her half until she's full, but then eat the leftovers. That part might be where the conflict is. If he ends up taking more, even after she's full, he's effectively getting more than half. But he claims he's not going to feel bad about it.\n\nIs it fair to split based on size? Some might argue that in a relationship, splitting things equally is a way to show respect and fairness, regardless of physical differences. Others might say that sharing food should be based on each person's needs. The wife's insistence on equality could be about feeling valued equally, not just in food but in the relationship. On the other hand, the author is trying to balance his own desires with what he sees as fair based on consumption.\n\nBut the key point is that the wife has already agreed to let him get the pizza with the coupon, so maybe she's making a point about fairness in their shared resources. The author's plan to take leftovers from her half could be seen as undermining her decision, even if she ends up not finishing her half. That might come across as not respecting her wishes, even if she's okay with the initial agreement.\n\nAlso, the author's justification for 60-40 because he eats more might be valid, but the wife's stance is about equality. If they can't agree, maybe a middle ground would be better. However, the author is planning to go ahead with his plan regardless, which might be seen as dismissive of her feelings. The question is whether the author is wrong for not following her 50-50 request, even if he has his own reasoning.\n\nI think the debate is between respecting individual preferences vs. perceived fairness based on need. In relationships, sometimes compromise is necessary, and if the wife is insistent on 50-50, the author might be in the wrong by not honoring that agreement, especially if they had a prior arrangement. Alternatively, if the author is acting in good faith based on his needs and the wife is being rigid, maybe not. But given the context, the wife's insistence on equality might be a stand for mutual respect, which the author's plan might be violating.\n"
