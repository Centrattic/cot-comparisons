My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple disagreeing on how to split a pizza they're going to order together. The husband wants 60/40 because he's bigger and eats more, while the wife insists on 50/50 for equality. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband ordered a pizza using a coupon that his wife gave permission for, and he does this about four times a year. He also takes her to a nice sushi place the same frequency. At sushi, he encourages her to order expensive items, while he sticks to cheaper ones. But when it's pizza, he wants a larger share.\n\nThe key points here are the arguments each side is making. The husband's rationale is based on his physical size and eating habits. He claims that since he's bigger and eats more, a 60/40 split is fair. The wife, on the other hand, is arguing for equality, hence the 50/50 split. \n\nNow, the author's plan is to let his wife eat her half, which he expects her to finish, and then eat the remaining half himself. If she doesn't finish her half, he'll take the leftovers. The wife ends up having to eat natto for breakfast if she doesn't finish, and the author doesn't feel bad about this.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, fairness in relationships can be subjective. The wife's stance is on equality, which is a common societal value. However, the husband is using a different metric of fairness based on actual consumption needs. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of mutual respect and compromise. The author mentions that he's brought up the 60/40 idea before, and the wife has consistently said no. Despite this, he's planning to ignore her wishes and take more than half. This could be seen as disregarding her input, even if he respects her preferences in other situations (like sushi).\n\nAnother angle is the imbalance in the examples. The husband brings up that he takes her to a nice sushi place four times a year, and he lets her order expensive dishes. But when it comes to pizza, he wants an unequal split. Is this a case of him being okay with her getting more in one context but not in another? The wife might feel that if they can have an unequal split at sushi (where he encourages her to spend more), then pizza should follow a similar principle. However, in the sushi case, he's not enforcing a strict 50/50; he's allowing her to have more. So the inconsistency might be the issue here. \n\nThe author's plan to take the leftovers after she eats her half is a bit manipulative. He's setting the table for her to have to eat natto instead of leftover pizza, which he doesn't feel bad about. This could be seen as using her own declared share against her, which isn't respectful of her autonomy. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, splitting things equally is often expected unless there's a compelling reason not to. The husband's reason is valid (size and appetite), but the wife's insistence on equality is also a valid perspective. The problem arises when one party consistently ignores the other's preferences despite previous discussions. \n\nSo, the author is using his physical attributes as a reason to take more, but if the wife is firm on equality, he's choosing to disregard her wishes. This could be seen as inconsiderate, even if his reasoning is logical. Relationships often require compromise, and if the wife's preference is to split it evenly, the author should respect that. His plan to take the leftovers is a way to circumvent her wishes, which is not fair. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because he's not respecting his wife's established preference, even though he has a different view on fairness. The proper approach would be to find a middle ground or accept her terms, even if it means he has to adjust his own expectations. His method of taking more after she eats her share is disrespectful and undermines her autonomy.\n"
