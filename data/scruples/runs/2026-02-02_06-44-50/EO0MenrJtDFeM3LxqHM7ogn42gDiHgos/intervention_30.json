My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about dividing a pizza between the author and their wife. The wife wants half each, but the author thinks 60-40 is fair because they're bigger and eat more. The author also mentions that they take the wife to sushi 4 times a year, but they order cheap plates while she can order expensive ones. So the author feels that's fair, but the wife still wants half the pizza.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's reasoning is valid. The wife gave permission to order the pizza with a coupon, so that's a mutual agreement. The author ordered a large pizza not for value but because they like a lot. The author's argument is based on their body size and appetite. But the wife insists on equality, 50-50. \n\nNow, fairness in relationships can be subjective. The author is trying to justify a different split based on their physical needs, but equality in relationships is often about mutual respect and compromise, not just physical traits. The author's plan to let the wife eat her \"half\" first and then take the rest if they're not full might be seen as undermining her autonomy. Also, the author's mention of the wife having to eat natto the next day if she's not full could come off as dismissive or not taking her preference seriously. \n\nThe sushi part shows the author makes an effort to accommodate the wife's tastes, which is positive. But the pizza situation's core issue is about how they split the food. The wife's insistence on equality might be her way of feeling that they share things equally, regardless of appetite. The author's approach of taking more by default could be seen as not respecting her wishes even after she's given consent to order the pizza. \n\nAlso, the author's response if the wife eats her half and they take the rest is a bit manipulative. It's a way to get around her request without direct confrontation. In relationships, respecting each other's preferences, even if they seem arbitrary, is important. The author might be right in thinking they eat more, but the wife's desire for equal division is about equality in the relationship, not just calories. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they're not respecting their wife's wishes despite mutual agreement to order the pizza. They're prioritizing their own needs over her stated preference, which can lead to resentment. The answer should be A.\n"
