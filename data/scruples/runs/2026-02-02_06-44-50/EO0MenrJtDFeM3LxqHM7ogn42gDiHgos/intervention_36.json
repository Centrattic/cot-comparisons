My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the pizza situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author wants to split a pizza 60-40 in his favor because he's bigger and eats more, but his wife insists on a 50-50 split. The author plans to let her eat her half first, then take the leftovers, even if that means she has to eat natto for breakfast the next day.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The wife allowed the purchase of the pizza with a coupon because she knows it's a treat for him. The author acknowledges that pizza is unhealthy and expensive, so he's not being unreasonable there. However, the main conflict is the split. The wife wants equal halves, but the author thinks his higher caloric needs justify a 60-40 split. He also mentions he takes her to an expensive sushi place four times a year, even though he prefers cheaper options, which he says shows he's making an effort for her.\n\nNow, the author's argument is based on physical size and consumption, but the wife's counter is about equality. The author plans to let her eat her half first, but then take the rest, which could leave her without leftovers. That seems a bit manipulative, as he's not directly being honest about his intentions. He's also making her eat natto the next day as a consequence, which is a bit harsh, even if he doesn't feel bad about it. \n\nIn relationships, fairness and communication are important. The wife might feel that equality in sharing the pizza is important, even if their physical needs differ. The author's approach to let her eat first and then take the rest could be seen as passive-aggressive. It might also indicate a lack of respect for her wishes, even though he's aware of her preferences and makes sacrifices in other areas (like the sushi). \n\nHowever, the author isn't forcing her to do anything. He's just not complying with her request for an equal split. The question is whether expecting a 60-40 split is reasonable. On one hand, it's about personal preference and how they handle shared expenses. The wife allowed the pizza purchase, so maybe she's okay with the cost but still wants an equal share. The author might feel that since he's paying for it (or contributing to the cost?), but the situation doesn't specify who's paying. If the pizza is a shared expense, then equal split might be expected. If he's paying for it entirely, maybe he's entitled to more. But the coupon might complicate that.\n\nAlso, the author's plan to take the leftovers after she's done is a bit sneaky. It's not a direct negotiation but a way to get what he wants without addressing her concerns. The wife might feel disrespected or that her preferences aren't being considered. The author's reasoning about body size and eating more might be a valid personal need, but in a relationship, compromise is key. If the wife is firm on the 50-50, the author might need to respect that to maintain harmony, even if he disagrees.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is making an effort to bring her to sushi places, which shows he's willing to accommodate her preferences. But maybe the pizza situation is different because it's his personal treat. But since it's a shared meal, the split becomes a point of contention. The wife's insistence on equality might be about fairness in the relationship, not just the meal. The author's approach could be seen as undermining that principle, even if he has a logical reason.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's reasoning is understandable, his approach to the situation\u2014letting her eat first and then taking the rest\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate. It's a minor issue, but it reflects a lack of respect for her wishes and could lead to resentment. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not compromising and for planning to take advantage of the situation in a passive-aggressive way.\n"
