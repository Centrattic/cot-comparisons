My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting a pizza with their wife. The author wants 60-40 because they're bigger and eat more, but the wife insists on 50-50. The author plans to take more than half if the wife eats less.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife allowed the pizza because of a coupon and it's considered a treat. The author also takes her to sushi four times a year, where he lets her have the more expensive options. So there's some mutual consideration there.\n\nThe key points are about fairness and compromise in a relationship. The wife wants equality, which she sees as fair, while the author thinks physical size and appetite matter. But maybe the wife's insistence on equal sharing isn't about the pizza size but about principle. Relationships often require compromise, even if it's not strictly \"logical\" from the other person's perspective.\n\nThe author's plan to take more than half if the wife eats less could be seen as manipulative. It undermines the agreed-upon split and might make the wife feel her wishes aren't respected. Even if he's planning to be nice and let her eat first, the act of not following the 50-50 agreement could hurt her feelings. It's about respect for each other's preferences and boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's reasoning is based on his physical needs and the fact that they both enjoy different foods in return. But maybe the wife's request for half is about feeling that they split things equally in their shared expenses or treats. The pizza is a joint purchase, so she might feel entitled to an equal share regardless of appetite.\n\nIn relationships, fairness isn't just about splitting things proportionally. It's about mutual respect and understanding. If the wife has repeatedly insisted, maybe the author should comply, even if it's not exactly what he thinks is fair. The author's plan to take more by default could come off as dismissive of her feelings. \n\nAlso, the part where he mentions she'll have to eat natto instead of leftover pizza is a bit passive-aggressive. It shows he's not taking her feelings into account, which isn't helpful. \n\nSo overall, the author might be in the wrong because he's not respecting the agreed-upon split and is planning to undermine it. The wife's insistence on equality is about their relationship's balance, not just the pizza. The answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
