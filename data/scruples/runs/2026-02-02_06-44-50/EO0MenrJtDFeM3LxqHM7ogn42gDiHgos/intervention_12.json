My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting a pizza between the author and his wife. The author wants a 60-40 split because he's taller, bigger, and eats more, while the wife insists on 50-50 for equality. The author plans to let her eat her half, which he thinks will be less than half, then take the rest. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The wife's main reasons are health concerns and the expense in Japan. The author acknowledges that but still wants to have it. The wife gave permission to order with a coupon, but the split is an issue. The author argues based on his body size and appetite, while the wife wants equality. \n\nNow, considering equality and fairness in a relationship. The wife wants to share equally, which might be part of her values. The author, on the other hand, is suggesting a different ratio based on physical attributes. The problem is that the wife is setting a boundary here. Even if the author eats more, forcing the split or not respecting her wishes could lead to conflict. \n\nThe author mentions that he takes her to sushi 4 times a year, but he orders cheap options while encouraging her to get expensive ones. Maybe this shows a pattern where he expects her to accommodate his preferences in one area but not in another. So when it's his turn, he wants a different split. That might be seen as unfair or selfish because he's not reciprocating the same flexibility. \n\nAlso, the author's plan to take the remaining pizza after she's done her half could be seen as manipulative or not respecting her consent. The wife agreed to the pizza under the condition of a 50-50 split. If he goes against that, he might be violating her expectations. \n\nIn relationships, equality isn't always about dividing things equally but about mutual respect and understanding. The wife's stance is about equality, so if the author disregards her wishes despite understanding her reasons, that could be the issue. Even if his logic is about appetite, the wife's agreement was based on the 50-50 split. The author's actions might undermine her boundaries, making him the asshole. \n\nSo the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because he's not respecting his wife's condition for equality, even if his own reasoning is about appetite. Relationships require compromise, and he's choosing not to comply, which could be seen as inconsiderate.\n"
