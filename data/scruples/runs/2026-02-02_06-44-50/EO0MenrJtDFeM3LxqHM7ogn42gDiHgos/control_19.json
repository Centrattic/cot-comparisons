My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about splitting a pizza between the author and his wife. The author ordered a pizza using a coupon that the wife allowed because of the coupon's value. He ordered a large pizza because he likes to eat a lot, not just because it's a better deal. The wife wants half each, but he thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife gave permission to order the pizza because of the coupon, so he's not going against her wishes entirely. The key issue is the division of the pizza. The author argues that his larger size and higher appetite justify getting more. The wife, on the other hand, insists on equal halves because of equality.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's think about fairness and mutual respect in a relationship. The wife might feel that equality in sharing is important, regardless of the size or appetite. The author's reasoning is practical, based on physical needs. However, the wife's perspective might be more about fairness and partnership. \n\nThe author mentions that he does things like taking her to sushi, even if he prefers simpler options, to accommodate her tastes. That shows consideration. But the pizza situation is different. If the wife expects equal shares, maybe she values equal contributions or sharing, even if one person eats more. The author's plan to take her half after she's done might be seen as undermining her choice, which could be perceived as unfair or disrespectful. \n\nAlso, the author's approach of letting her eat her half first and then taking the rest could be seen as a passive-aggressive way to get his way without mutual agreement. The wife's insistence on half might be about respecting each other's preferences, even if it's not practical. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is important. The author could try to find a middle ground, like different portions each time or having separate meals. But by planning to take her share if she doesn't finish, he's not really compromising. \n\nSo, maybe the author is not in the wrong because he's considering his own needs and has justified the 60-40 split based on his size and appetite. However, the way he's handling it without mutual agreement might be where the problem lies. But the question is whether he's in the wrong in expecting more than half. If the wife wants equal, but he thinks it should be different, it's a matter of differing values. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) format usually looks at whether the person is being unreasonable. \n\nSince the wife gave permission for the pizza, and the author is just trying to split it based on his needs, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, the insistence on not letting her have half despite her wishes could be seen as inconsiderate. But his argument is that she'll just eat less than half, so he's not taking more than she allows. It's a bit of a gray area, but if the question is about whether he's in the wrong for expecting more than half, the answer might be B (No), because he's justifying it based on his physical needs and there's no explicit agreement on equal split beyond her initial demand. The wife's insistence on equality might be her personal stance, but the author's reasoning isn't unreasonable.\n"
