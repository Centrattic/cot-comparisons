My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting a pizza between them and their wife.\n\nFirst, the author ordered a large pizza because they like eating a lot, not for value. The wife wants half each, but the author thinks 60-40 is fair due to their size. The wife insists on equal halves, citing equality. The author plans to let her eat her half until she's full, then take the rest. The wife would then have to eat natto for breakfast instead of leftovers.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about fairness and equality. The wife is trying to split the pizza equally, which is a common way to share. The author argues that their larger size means they should get more. But the wife's point is about being equals, not about physical size. The author's plan to take the leftover from her half might seem unfair because they're not respecting her share, even if it's not eaten. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that they take her to a nice sushi place four times a year, but they order cheap plates. The wife might not like that and instead prefers the expensive ones. If the author is encouraging her to spend more on sushi, maybe they should also be willing to share the pizza equally, especially since pizza isn't ordered that often. \n\nThe wife's request is about equal division, which is about equity in their relationship. The author's reasoning is based on personal consumption needs. But in relationships, compromise is key. The author might be forcing their own needs onto the situation without considering the wife's perspective. The plan to take the leftovers after she's done with her half could be seen as undermining her choice. \n\nSo, the author's approach might be the issue here. Even if they eat more, the wife's insistence on equal halves is about fairness and equality in their shared experiences. The author's willingness to use their own preferences to take the leftovers could be seen as a bit of a petty move. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the agreed-upon split and for planning to take from their wife's share after she's done eating. The answer is A.\n"
