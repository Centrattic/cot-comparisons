My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about splitting a pizza between the author and his wife.\n\nFirst, the author ordered a pizza using a coupon his wife allowed. The wife wants half, but the author thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more. The wife insists on equality, 50-50. The author plans to let her eat her half first and then take the leftovers, even though she might not finish hers. \n\nNow, the key points here. The wife gave permission for the pizza, maybe with the understanding that they share. The author mentions that he takes her out to sushi four times a year, where he's more frugal and she gets the better meals. So maybe he's trying to balance things out that way. But the pizza is a food he loves, and he's just getting it a few times a year. \n\nThe issue is about fairness. The wife wants equal portions because they're supposed to be equals. The author argues based on size and appetite. But does that justify a 60-40 split? \n\nIn relationships, fairness isn't always about equal distribution. If both parties agree on a different split, that's fine. But if one person is forcing their view of fairness on the other, that could be the problem. The wife's argument is about equality, while the author's is about need. \n\nThe author's plan to let her eat her half first and then take the leftovers might leave her with less, but he doesn't feel bad about it. The wife is being considerate by allowing the pizza, maybe expecting a compromise. The author might be seen as not respecting her choice to split equally, even if he thinks his way is fair. \n\nAlso, in the sushi example, he's allowing her to have more there. Maybe there's a pattern of him giving her more in some areas but demanding more in others. But the pizza is a special treat for him. \n\nBut the main question is about the wrong. Is the author wrong for not agreeing to 50-50? If the wife is okay with the coupon and the pizza, but insists on the split, and he's going against that, maybe he's in the wrong. Because the wife's consent might be conditional on the 50-50 split. \n\nAlternatively, if the wife didn't specify the split when giving permission, maybe it's his choice. But she repeated her demand, so he's aware. If he goes against her wishes, that's where the problem is. The wife's insistence on equality might be a non-negotiable for her. \n\nThe author's plan to take the leftovers after she eats her half is a bit sneaky. He knows she might not finish, so he gets more without directly taking it. That could be seen as manipulative. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, sharing food equally in a relationship is common. Even if someone eats more, they might still agree to split to avoid conflict. The author's approach might come off as selfish, even if he justifies it. \n\nSo putting it all together, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not respecting his wife's wishes for equality in the split, despite her allowing him to have the pizza. The principle of equality in the relationship is important here.\n"
