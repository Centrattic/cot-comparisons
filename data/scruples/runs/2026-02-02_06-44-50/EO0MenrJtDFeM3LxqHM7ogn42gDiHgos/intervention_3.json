My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The story is about splitting a pizza. The guy ordered pizza because he has a coupon and his wife allowed it. He wants 60-40 split because he's bigger and eats more, but his wife wants half each. He mentions he eats pizza 4 times a year and takes her to sushi four times too. He plans to let her eat her half first and then take the rest.\n\nHmm. First, the wife gave permission to get the pizza. So he's not doing something she didn't agree to. But the issue is the split. He justifies 60-40 based on body size. But the wife wants equality. Maybe she feels it's unfair because they're supposed to be equal. But maybe he's not wrong to consider their different needs. \n\nWait, but in relationships, fairness isn't always about exact halves. If he's bigger, maybe he should get more. But the wife might see it as unequal in other ways. However, the author is planning to let her eat first and then take the leftovers. That might be manipulative. He's not going to feel bad about it, which could be the problem. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's doing something for her (sushi) and she's not reciprocating in pizza? Not sure. The wife allowed the pizza, so maybe she expects to share equally. The author's plan is to take advantage of her portion. That's where the asshole part comes in. He's not respecting her share, even if he's bigger. Maybe the right thing is to agree to split it 50-50, even if he could eat more. But the wife didn't ask for him to take less. \n\nI'm torn. The author's reasoning is about fairness based on size, but the wife's perspective is about equality. Maybe both have valid points. But the act of taking her leftovers after she eats might be the issue. If he just takes 60% and she takes 40%, maybe that's okay. But his plan to take her leftovers is sneaky. So maybe the author is in the wrong because he's not being honest. He's not splitting 60-40 upfront. He's letting her think it's 50-50 but then taking more. That's the asshole move here.\n"
