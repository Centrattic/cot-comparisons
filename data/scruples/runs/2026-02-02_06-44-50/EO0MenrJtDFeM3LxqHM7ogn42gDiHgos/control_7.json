My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting a pizza with his wife. He ordered a pizza using a coupon she gave him, and she wants half for herself. He thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more. He also mentions that he takes her to a nice sushi place four times a year, but he doesn't like the same things she does, so he orders cheaper. He plans to let her eat her half, but if she doesn't finish it, he'll eat the rest. The question is whether he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, the wife agreed to let him order the pizza with the coupon. So she's okay with the purchase. The issue is the split. He argues it should be 60-40 based on their sizes and eating habits. She wants equal halves. The concept of equality versus fairness comes into play here. When people cohabitate, sometimes they split things equally, but sometimes differently based on needs. However, the wife might see the 50-50 as fair because they're partners. The husband's reasoning is based on physical needs, but maybe the wife feels that splitting unequally is unfair, especially if they're supposed to share equally in other aspects of life.\n\nHe also mentions that he lets her eat her fill first, but if she doesn't finish her half, he takes the rest. That might come off as a bit manipulative. Like, he's not just taking 60% upfront but is using her leftovers. It could be seen as not respecting her decision to have half. Even if she eats less, he's taking advantage of that. The wife might feel like he's not being honest about his intentions. The husband is trying to justify his actions by saying he's bigger, but in a relationship, compromises are often needed. Maybe the wife's request for half is about fairness in sharing, not about the amount she actually eats. \n\nThere's also the aspect of cultural differences. He mentions pizza is a taste from his home country, and she's aware of that. But Japan's context is expensive, so she's cautious. However, she allowed him to order it with a coupon. The husband's plan to take advantage of her leftovers might make him seem selfish, even if his reasoning is about body size. Relationships often require mutual respect and finding a middle ground. If he insists on 60-40 without discussion, that might not be respectful of her feelings. \n\nHe also brings up the sushi example where he lets her have the expensive stuff. But in that case, he's making a choice based on his own preferences, not forcing her to take a certain amount. The pizza situation is different because he's taking a larger portion by default. Maybe she wants the choice to have half, even if she doesn't eat all of it. \n\nIn the end, the husband's approach is more about his own satisfaction and less about respecting her agreed-upon terms. Even if she's okay with him ordering the pizza, the split is a mutual decision. By not agreeing to her 50-50 split and planning to take more, he's disregarding her wishes. The answer might be that he's in the wrong (A), but I need to check the nuances again.\n"
