My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about splitting a pizza between the author and his wife. The author ordered a pizza using a coupon his wife gave him, and he wants to have 60% of it because he's bigger and eats more. The wife insists on splitting it 50-50, saying they're equals. The author also mentions that he takes her to a nice sushi place four times a year, where he orders cheaper items and encourages her to get the more expensive ones. Now he's planning to let her eat her half until she's full, then take the rest, knowing she'll have to eat natto for breakfast instead of leftovers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author and his wife have different preferences and eating habits. The wife has given permission to order the pizza, but she wants an equal split. The author argues that his body size justifies a larger portion. The wife might feel that equality in the relationship means sharing equally, regardless of size. The author's plan seems to be a form of passive resistance, where he's not directly arguing but taking more by letting her eat first and then taking what's left. This could be seen as undermining her wishes or not respecting her agreement. \n\nIn terms of fairness, some might argue that splitting food based on size and appetite is practical, but others might say that mutual respect and agreed-upon terms (like a 50-50 split) are more important in a relationship. The author's approach could come off as manipulative, using a loophole to get more than agreed. The wife might feel disrespected if he doesn't honor the initial agreement of half each. The fact that he's doing this despite previous discussions suggests a pattern of not respecting her wishes, which could be the issue. \n\nAlso, the author's justification about their other activities (sushi) might not directly relate to the pizza issue. While he's being generous in other ways, that doesn't necessarily mean he has the right to override her expectations in this situation. The core issue is about mutual agreements and respecting each other's terms. \n\nSo, whether he's in the wrong depends on whether honoring the agreed split is more important than adjusting for their physical differences. If the wife clearly communicated her expectation of an equal split, then the author's plan to take more could be seen as the problem. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not respecting the agreed-upon terms even though he's using a different logic. Alternatively, maybe B if the argument is that the split should be practical based on needs. But in relationships, agreements are important, so respecting the 50-50 split even if it's not strictly fair in terms of size might be expected. Hence, the author is in the wrong.\n"
