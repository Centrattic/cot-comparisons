My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong by expecting more than half the pizza. The situation involves a couple where the husband wants a larger share because he's bigger and eats more. The wife insists on splitting it 50-50, citing equality. The husband orders pizza occasionally and also splurges on sushi for her, even though he prefers cheaper options.\n\nFirst, the concept of equality in relationships is important. The wife argues that they should be equal, hence splitting the pizza equally. The husband, however, feels that physical size and appetite justify a different split. The key here is whether fairness is based on equality or proportionality. \n\nIn many relationships, splitting things equally is seen as fair, regardless of individual needs. But the husband's argument is that since he eats more, he should get more. This could be seen as a matter of personal preference versus shared norms. \n\nThe husband also mentions that he takes her to a sushi place, which he knows she likes, and encourages her to order expensive dishes. This might be his way of balancing out the pizza situation. However, the wife's insistence on half the pizza could be about more than just the meal\u2014it might be about feeling respected or valued in the relationship. \n\nThe husband's plan to let her eat her half first and then take the leftovers could be perceived as manipulative or inconsiderate. It might lead to her feeling that her share isn't sufficient, especially if she's not as hungry. The next day, she has to eat natto instead of pizza, which might not be her preference either. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the perspective. The wife's stance on equality is valid, and the husband's reasoning is based on his needs. However, the husband's approach to taking leftovers might not be respectful of her agreed-upon share. In many relationships, mutual respect and compromise are key. If the wife has agreed to the pizza under the condition of a split, the husband going against that could be seen as disregarding her wishes. \n\nTherefore, the husband might be in the wrong for not respecting her request for equality, even if he believes his reasoning is fair. Relationships often require balancing personal desires with mutual agreements, and the husband's actions could be seen as undermining that balance.\n"
