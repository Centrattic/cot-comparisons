My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the author wants to order a pizza using a coupon, and his wife agreed. But she insists on splitting it 50-50. The author argues that he's bigger and eats more, so he thinks a 60-40 split is fair. He mentions this happens four times a year, and in return, he takes her to sushi places four times a year, but he eats cheaper options there. The wife still wants half the pizza, and the author plans to let her eat until she's full, then finish the rest of her half himself, making her eat natto instead of leftover pizza the next day. The question is whether he's the asshole here.\n\nHmm. Let's start by looking at the key points. The wife agreed to the pizza because he used a coupon and it's a treat for him. But she's set the condition of splitting it equally. The author thinks this is unfair because of their body size and appetite differences. He also points out that he's making an effort by taking her to sushi, which she likes more, and he's choosing cheaper options there so she can have the better ones. However, he's planning to take advantage of her 50% share by eating the rest after she's done, which might leave her without leftovers.\n\nFirst, the concept of equality versus fairness. The wife might see splitting it equally as being fair because they both contributed to the agreement (he used a coupon, she gave permission). The author, however, believes fairness should account for their different appetites. But maybe the wife's insistence is about not wanting to feel like she's missing out on her share, especially if she doesn't like pizza much. The author mentions she doesn't really like pizza because it's unhealthy and expensive. So her not liking it might mean she's not going to eat half of it anyway. But he's still making her give up her half just because he thinks it's fair based on appetite.\n\nAlso, the author's plan to take her leftovers after she's full could be seen as underhanded. Even if she eats less, he's not supposed to take her share after the fact. That's manipulating the agreement, which might be the asshole move. He's being sneaky about it, making her eat natto the next day instead of pizza. That seems like he's punishing her for her own dietary preferences.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is making an effort by taking her to sushi places and choosing cheaper options so she can have better ones. That's a nice gesture. But maybe the pizza issue is a small thing compared to that, but it's about mutual respect and agreed terms. If they made an agreement that she approves of (half each), even if it's not what he thinks is fair, he should honor it. Otherwise, he's undermining her boundaries.\n\nAnother angle: the author is using the argument of physical size to justify taking more. But that's not necessarily a valid reason. If they agreed on half each, that's a compromise. He's not justifying it based on need but on his own appetite. Also, the wife might feel that even if he eats more in general, the pizza is a shared meal, so it's about sharing the experience, not just the food.\n\nMoreover, the author is planning to take advantage of the situation by eating her leftovers, which could be seen as not respecting her decision. If she's okay with eating less than half, then maybe she's content, but he's still taking her share, which she might not want. That's a breach of the agreement he made with her. The fact that he's anticipating her having to eat natto instead is part of his plan, which seems like he's not considering her preferences beyond his own.\n\nIn terms of fairness, equality vs. equity is a common debate. The author is arguing for equity (different shares based on need), while the wife wants equality. But when people agree to something, especially in a relationship, respecting the agreed terms is usually more important than personal notions of fairness. If the wife is okay with him having more in other situations (like sushi), maybe the pizza is a minor point, but the key is mutual respect and agreed-upon terms.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is likely in the wrong (Answer A) because he's not respecting the agreed-upon terms of splitting the pizza 50-50 and is planning to take advantage of his wife's leftovers, which could be seen as manipulative and disrespectful to her boundaries. Even though his intentions might seem reasonable (appetite, reciprocal gestures), the action of undermining the agreed split is the issue here.\n"
