My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple where the husband wants to order pizza and believes a 60-40 split is fair, while the wife insists on 50-50. The husband argues that he's bigger and eats more, and he also mentions that he takes her to a nice sushi place in return. He plans to let her eat her half and then take the leftovers after she's full.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The wife agreed to the pizza order because he found a coupon and it's a treat he enjoys. The main conflict is about the division. The husband thinks his larger size justifies a bigger share, but the wife believes in equality. The husband is okay with the wife eating natto instead of leftover pizza the next day and doesn't feel bad about it.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's wrong. From a fairness perspective, the 50-50 split is about equality, while 60-40 is about needs or consumption. The wife might see the equal split as a sign of fairness in their relationship, while the husband thinks it's about actual needs. The husband's plan to take the leftovers after she eats her half is a bit sneaky. Even if he's not forcing her to take the whole half, the fact that he knows she might not finish and then he takes what's left could be seen as manipulative. \n\nAlso, the husband mentions that the wife \"deserves\" half, implying that her equal share is a right. However, he's dismissing her stance by saying she's \"supposed to be equals,\" which could be a bit dismissive. The husband's reasoning is based on his physical needs, but maybe the wife values the gesture of sharing equally. The husband is also planning to not feel bad about making her eat natto, which shows he's not considering her feelings about it. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband does make an effort by taking her to sushi places. But that's a separate act of generosity. The pizza is his treat, and if he's the one who got permission, then maybe he should have the flexibility to decide how to divide it, unless there was a prior agreement. However, the wife gave permission with the condition of a 50-50 split. If that's part of the agreement, then not honoring it might be the issue. \n\nSo, the husband is in a position where he's trying to balance his own preferences with his wife's expectations. The wife might feel that the equal split is a way to show fairness and respect in their relationship, even if their physical needs differ. The husband's plan to take advantage of the leftovers might undermine the agreement they made. Therefore, the husband might be in the wrong because he's not respecting her condition for the agreement, even if his reasoning is about his appetite.\n"
