My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about splitting a pizza with his wife. The wife says half is hers, but the author thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more. They've had this discussion before, and he's planning to take more after she eats her \"half.\"\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The wife allowed him to order pizza with a coupon because he loves it. He's considering her preferences by taking her to sushi, even though he prefers cheaper options. On the flip side, she's not happy with the pizza split. \n\nThe author's argument is based on physical size and appetite. He believes he should get more because he's taller and eats more. But fairness in relationships isn't just about physical needs. Equality in sharing can be a big deal. If they agreed on splitting things equally, maybe that's part of their mutual understanding. The author might be overstepping by not respecting her demand for half, even if it's not based on appetite.\n\nAlso, his plan to take more after she eats her half sounds sneaky. That could be seen as dishonest because he's not being upfront. He's also planning to let her have natto instead of pizza leftovers, which might not be fair. \n\nThe wife's insistence on half could be about fairness in the relationship, not just the food. If he respects her preferences in sushi, maybe she expects the same in pizza. The fact that he's done this before suggests a pattern where he's not respecting her wishes. \n\nSo, while he has his reasoning, the core of the issue is mutual respect. The wife might feel her needs aren't being acknowledged. The author's approach might be inconsiderate, even if his logic is based on appetite. Relationships often require compromise beyond physical needs. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by not honoring the agreed-upon split and planning to take more without discussing it openly.\n"
