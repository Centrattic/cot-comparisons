My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting a pizza with his wife. He ordered a pizza using a coupon after she gave permission. He wants a 60-40 split because he's bigger and eats more, but she insists on 50-50.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core of the issue. The wife gave permission for him to buy the pizza, so that part seems okay. He's ordering it as a special treat, maybe once a year. He also takes her to a nice sushi place four times a year, which shows he's making an effort to accommodate her preferences. \n\nNow, the problem is the division. The husband argues that his body size and appetite justify a larger share. However, the wife feels that equality is important. From a fairness perspective, equality in shares might be expected in a relationship, even if one person eats more. The husband's logic is based on physical needs, but relationships often involve compromise beyond just physical aspects. \n\nThe husband's plan to take more after she's done eating her \"half\" could be seen as sneaky. Even if she eats less, taking from her portion without her consent might be considered dishonest. Trust and mutual respect are important, so manipulating the situation like that could be a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's insistence on equal portions might not consider his actual needs. However, in a relationship, people might value fairness in sharing, especially when it's a shared expense or a shared experience. The husband's approach could come off as selfish, even if he's justifying it with logic. \n\nThe key points are: mutual respect, communication, and compromise. The husband could have discussed his needs more and found a middle ground instead of planning to take more after the fact. The wife could also be more flexible if she knows he only indulges occasionally. But the husband's method of taking more without her knowledge might be the main issue here. \n\nSo, considering all that, the husband might be in the wrong because he's not respecting her terms and is planning to deceive her. Even if he's bigger, respecting agreed-upon terms is part of a healthy relationship. The answer might be A (in the wrong), but I need to make sure there's no other angle. Maybe some argue that he's just being practical, but the way he's handling the situation is problematic.\n"
