My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. They want a yes or no answer, labeled A or B. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The husband wants to order a large pizza using a coupon, but his wife is insisting on splitting it 50-50. He argues that he's bigger and eats more, so he thinks a 60-40 split is fair. The wife, on the other hand, wants equality, hence half each. The husband plans to let her eat her half first and then take from it if he's still hungry, leading her to not have leftovers for breakfast. \n\nHmm. The key points here are about fairness and mutual respect in a relationship. The wife's reasoning is based on equality, which is a common societal value. She might feel that splitting things equally is the right approach, especially if they've discussed it before. The husband, however, is considering physical needs; being taller and bigger, he might need more food. But the problem is that their expectations differ, and he's not respecting her stated preference.\n\nHe mentions that he orders pizza four times a year and takes her to sushi four times. So, he's making an effort to accommodate her preferences in other areas. However, the issue here is about the pizza split. The wife gave permission to order the pizza, but the terms of that permission include her expecting half. The husband might not be wrong to want a different split, but he's planning to override her wishes, which could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nThe husband's plan to let her eat her half first and then take from it if he's still hungry might leave her without leftovers, which he's okay with. But the wife's insistence on half the pizza might be more about principle than the actual amount she eats. If she's declared her preference, and he's not honoring that, even if he doesn't agree, it's a matter of respecting each other's boundaries.\n\nIn relationships, compromise is important. The husband is not compromising here and is instead planning to take what he wants after her initial consumption. The wife's perspective is that they should be equal, and he's disregarding that. So, the husband is in the wrong because he's not respecting his wife's terms, even if he has a different view on fairness. The correct answer would be A.\n"
