My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about splitting a pizza between him and his wife. He's in Japan and ordered a pizza, which his wife allows because he found a coupon. But she wants half the pizza each, while he thinks he should get 60% because he's bigger and eats more. He's planning to take more than half after she eats her fill.\n\nHmm. First, the wife's perspective. She might value equality in their relationship. She agreed to him buying pizza, perhaps expecting to share it equally. The idea of \"equal parts\" is a common way people split things, especially in relationships where both partners contribute to household expenses or responsibilities. Even if he eats more, sharing equally could be her way of balancing things, like if she's contributing more in other areas, like sushi dinners. \n\nThe author mentions he takes her to a nice sushi place four times a year, but he orders cheaper options, while he encourages her to order expensive ones. So maybe she's compensating through the pizza split, thinking that's fair in the context of their shared expenses. If he's taking her to a nice place, maybe she feels that pizza is a mutual activity where splitting equally is fair, even if he eats more. \n\nThen there's the cultural aspect. In Japan, sharing equally might be more emphasized in relationships, or maybe she's just used to that norm. The author is from a different country, so maybe his expectations are influenced by his home culture where splitting based on appetite is more common. \n\nThe author's plan to take more than half after she eats her fill could be seen as underhanded. If he's okay with her having natto instead of leftovers, maybe he's being a bit manipulative. Even if he's bigger, it's not just about physical size but about mutual respect. If he says, \"Let you eat your half first, then take the rest,\" he's technically not violating the initial agreement, but it's a bit sneaky. \n\nOn the other hand, he's not forcing her to eat her half; he's just taking advantage of her eating less. But is that fair? If she agreed to half the pizza, expecting to have that amount, but he's planning to take more than that, maybe he's being unfair. The key point is about mutual agreement. If she expects half, even if he feels it's not based on his needs, he's going against her wishes. \n\nAlso, the author brings up that he's already compromising by ordering pizza, which she doesn't like because it's unhealthy and expensive. So maybe she's making a concession by allowing it but wants to set a boundary on how it's split. The author is pushing back on that boundary, thinking he should get more. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is important. If the wife has a clear expectation (half each), even if the husband thinks it's unfair, respecting her wishes might be more important than getting the exact share he wants. The husband's reasoning is based on physical size and appetite, but equality in sharing isn't always about the amount consumed\u2014it's about fairness in the relationship dynamics. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the wife might feel that the equal split is fair in the context of their relationship, considering other factors like the sushi outings and his occasional pizza orders. The author's plan to take more than half despite her wishes could be seen as not respecting her boundaries, hence making him the asshole in this situation. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
