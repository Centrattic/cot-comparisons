My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario is about splitting a pizza with their wife. The husband wants a 60-40 split because he's bigger and eats more, while the wife insists on a 50-50 split. He argues that they have other compromises, like sushi, but she still wants equal pizza.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the dynamics here. The couple has a mutual agreement sometimes where he can order pizza with a coupon, and she allows it. But the split is the issue. The husband feels that his body size justifies a larger share, but the wife believes in equality. \n\nThe key points are about fairness and mutual respect. The husband is using his physical size and eating habits as a reason, but maybe the wife values equality in their shared meals. Even if he eats more, the concept of sharing equally might be important to her as a symbol of partnership. \n\nAlso, the husband's plan to take leftover pizza after she's done eating her half seems sneaky. That might come off as manipulative. The wife is being fair in her request, and the husband is not respecting her boundaries, even if he thinks he's justified. \n\nThe other part is about the sushi outings. He takes her to a nice place but orders cheap for himself. That's a good gesture, but does that balance out the pizza issue? Maybe not. The wife might still feel that pizza is a special treat, and she should have her share. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. The husband is not compromising here. He's sticking to his 60-40 idea despite her insistence. That could be seen as the problem. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not respecting her request. \n\nI think the consensus would be that he's in the wrong. The wife's request for half the pizza is straightforward, and the husband is being selfish. Even if he eats more, the principle of mutual agreement is important. So the answer is A.\n"
