My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the person is asking if they're the asshole for expecting more than half the pizza. They ordered a pizza with a coupon, got permission from their wife. The issue is splitting it 50-50 vs 60-40.\n\nFirst, the wife is against pizza because it's unhealthy and expensive. The husband likes it because it's a home country taste. He ordered a large pizza because he eats more. He mentions he's taller and bigger, so he argues for 60% for himself. But she insists on half. The husband plans to let her eat her fill, which he thinks would be less than half, then eat the rest of her half. So he's not following the 50-50 split he agreed to, but he's taking advantage of her eating less.\n\nHmm. The key points here: They had an agreement to split it 50-50. The husband is not following that agreement, even if he thinks it's unfair. The wife's reasoning is about equality. The husband's reasoning is about body size and eating more. But maybe the agreement was already made when she gave permission. So if he agreed to split it, then going back on that could be the problem. Also, he's planning to take more than half under the guise of her eating less. That might be manipulative. The wife might feel disrespected if he's breaking the agreement. On the other hand, maybe the original agreement wasn't fair. But in the context of the question, the husband is not adhering to the agreed-upon split. So even if he thinks it's unfair, he's in the wrong because he's not respecting the agreement. So answer A.\n"
