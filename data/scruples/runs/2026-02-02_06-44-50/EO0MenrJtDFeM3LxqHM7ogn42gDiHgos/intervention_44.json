My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting a pizza with their wife. The author wants a 60-40 split because they're taller and eat more, but the wife insists on half each. The author also mentions that they take her to sushi four times a year, but they order cheap plates while she gets the expensive ones. The author plans to let her eat her half until she's full and then take the leftovers.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The wife allowed the pizza order because of a coupon, and she's okay with it. The disagreement is about the portion sizes. The author's reasoning is based on their body size and eating habits. The wife, however, wants equal halves, emphasizing equality. The author feels that their approach is fair, but the wife disagrees. \n\nThe author mentions that they do something similar with sushi, where they encourage her to get more expensive items. But in that case, the author is spending their own money and perhaps making a sacrifice, while with the pizza, they want to take more. However, the wife is insistent on equal shares despite the author's reasoning. The author's plan to take her leftovers after she's done is a bit sneaky and might be seen as manipulative.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the wife gave permission to get the pizza, so that's not the issue. The main conflict is about the division. The author's argument is about personal consumption needs, but the wife argues for equality. In a relationship, fairness can be subjective. The wife might feel that equal sharing is fair, especially since the author is ordering the pizza for them both. Even if the author eats more, the wife's preference for equal portions is valid. The author's plan to take her leftovers after she's full seems to undermine her right to her half, which could be seen as not respecting her wishes. So, maybe the author is being a bit inconsiderate by not honoring the agreed-upon split, even if they think their reasoning is logical. The wife's expectation of equality is part of the agreement, so the author's actions might be seen as the problem here. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're not respecting the wife's terms for splitting the pizza.\n"
