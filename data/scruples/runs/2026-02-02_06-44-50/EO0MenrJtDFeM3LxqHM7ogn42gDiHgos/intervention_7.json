My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple splitting a pizza. The husband wants 60-40 because he's bigger and eats more, but the wife insists on 50-50 for equality. The husband plans to take leftovers after she's done eating.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the context. The wife allowed him to buy pizza with a coupon, so she's okay with the purchase. The argument is about the split. The husband's reasoning is based on his physical needs, but the wife sees it as equality. \n\nHmm, equality in relationships often means different things. The wife might feel that being equal means sharing equally, even if their needs differ. The husband, on the other hand, argues that his body requires more, so the split should reflect that. \n\nBut the husband's plan to take her leftovers might be seen as unfair. If she's only eaten part of her half, taking the rest could make her feel disrespected. Even if she didn't eat all her half, the arrangement was for her to have that amount. \n\nThe husband also mentions he takes her to sushi 4 times a year. Maybe this shows he's considerate of her preferences, but that doesn't necessarily justify the pizza split. The key is mutual respect. If the wife is okay with the pizza but insists on equal split, the husband's plan might undermine that. \n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, he's not forcing her, but he's planning to take more than agreed. The wife's insistence on equality might be a boundary he's crossing by not respecting her terms. Even if he thinks he's entitled, respecting her wishes is part of a healthy relationship. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (he's in the wrong) because he's not respecting her agreed-upon split and is planning to take more without her consent. The concept of equality in relationships isn't just about physical needs but mutual respect for each other's values and boundaries.\n"
