My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about pizza sharing between the author and his wife. The author wants 60% of the pizza for himself because he's bigger and eats more, while the wife insists on a 50-50 split as equals. \n\nFirst, the author ordered a pizza using a coupon, with the wife's permission. He argues that his size and appetite justify a larger share. The wife, on the other hand, believes in equality, hence half each. The author plans to take the remaining pizza after the wife has eaten her \"half,\" which is less than half, which he thinks is fair. \n\nHmm. The key points here are about fairness and mutual respect. The wife agreed to let him order the pizza, so she's okay with that part. The issue is the division. The author feels that his physical needs mean he should get more, but the wife sees it as an equal partnership. \n\nIn relationships, fairness can be subjective. If both are okay with their respective portions and the arrangement, maybe it's not a problem. But the wife's insistence on equality might be about treating each other as equals in the relationship, not just in the pizza. The author's plan to take the leftovers after she eats might undermine her request for half. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that he takes her to sushi places, and she does the same with natto. Maybe there's a pattern of each giving something up for the other's preferences. But pizza is a personal preference, and maybe the wife is okay with that, but the division is where the conflict is.\n\nIs it about respecting her wishes even if he thinks it's unfair? If the wife has set a boundary that she wants half, maybe he should respect it to maintain relationship harmony, even if he thinks it's not based on his needs. The author's plan to ignore her share and take the rest might be seen as disrespectful. \n\nOn the other hand, if the wife is okay with him taking the leftover after she eats her half, maybe the author is overcomplicating it. But he's planning to take her leftover, which could be seen as not honoring the agreement. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for not adhering to the wife's 50-50 rule. The answer might depend on how the wife feels about the arrangement. If she's insistent on half, and the author is going against it, he might be in the wrong. But if she's flexible and he's just calculating based on appetite, maybe not. \n\nBut the author's approach of letting her eat her half and then taking the rest could be seen as circumventing her request. That might be where the issue lies. The wife might feel disrespected if he doesn't honor her share. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for not respecting her wishes, even if his reasoning is based on practicality.\n"
