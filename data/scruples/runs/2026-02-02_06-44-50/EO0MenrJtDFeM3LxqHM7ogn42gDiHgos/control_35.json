My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting a pizza between them and their wife. The author wants 60% because they're bigger and eat more, but the wife insists on half each. The author plans to take the remaining after she's done eating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They both have different preferences. The wife doesn't like pizza, so maybe she's not even that interested in it. The husband is allowed to order it because he brings her other things, like sushi. The wife's insistence on half might be about equality, but maybe she's not really eating it all. The husband's plan is to take the leftovers, which he argues is fair because she can't finish her half. \n\nThe key points here are about fairness and mutual respect. The wife's argument is based on equality, which is important in a relationship. However, the husband is considering their different appetites and preferences. The fact that he compromises by ordering sushi for her might balance things. But does taking her share after she's done count as fair? The husband's approach could be seen as sneaky, but maybe it's a way to respect her wishes while getting his own way. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel her needs aren't respected if he takes what she's supposed to have. However, if she's not going to eat it, is it wrong to let her have the first cut and then take the leftovers? The husband's reasoning is practical. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the wife truly wants her half or just the principle of it. If she's okay with leftovers and the husband is being considerate, maybe he's not wrong. But if the wife feels her share is being taken, that's a problem. But given the context, the husband's actions seem like a compromise. So the answer is B (No).\n"
