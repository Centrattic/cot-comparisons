My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this question. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple's disagreement over splitting a pizza.\n\nFirst, the husband wants to order a large pizza, which he loves, and he has a coupon so his wife agreed. He feels that because he's bigger and eats more, he should get 60% and she 40%. She insists on a 50-50 split because they should be equal. The husband plans to let her eat her half, then eat the remaining of her half if he's still hungry, even if that leaves her with nothing. He's not planning to feel bad about it.\n\nSo, the main issue is the fairness of the pizza split. Let me break it down. The wife agreed to the purchase because of the coupon, but she still wants half. The husband argues that his body requires more food. On the other hand, the wife's insistence on equality might be about fairness in their relationship, not just the meal. \n\nThe husband also mentions that he takes her to a nice sushi place four times a year, even though he prefers cheaper options. So, he's making an effort to accommodate her tastes. However, when it comes to pizza, he wants a different split. The question is whether splitting based on physical size is reasonable or if equality in sharing is more important.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, mutual respect and compromise are key. The wife might see the pizza as a shared meal, and expecting equal portions might be her way of showing fairness. The husband's plan to take more after she's done could be seen as taking advantage, even if she's okay with eating less. It might also create resentment. \n\nAlso, the husband's approach of letting her eat first and then him taking more could undermine her agreement. If she agreed under the condition of 50-50, but he doesn't stick to that, he might be disregarding her terms. The wife's insistence on half could be about feeling respected and valued as an equal partner, not just about food. \n\nThe husband's argument about body size might be valid in terms of nutritional needs, but in a shared meal setting, people often compromise. The key is whether the husband is being unfair by not respecting her terms. Even if she ends up eating less, if she agreed to 50-50, he going beyond that might be the problem. \n\nAlso, the husband's plan to make her eat natto instead of leftovers the next day could be seen as a bit harsh or dismissive of her preferences. It shows he's not considering her well-being, even if it's a small thing.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband's actions might be seen as inconsiderate and not respecting their agreement. Even if he has a logical reason for wanting more, the wife's request for equality is about their relationship dynamic. Therefore, the husband might be in the wrong by not honoring her terms.\n"
