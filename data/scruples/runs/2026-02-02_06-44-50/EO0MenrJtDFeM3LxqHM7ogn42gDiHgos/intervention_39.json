My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about splitting a pizza between a husband and wife. The husband wants a 60-40 split because he's bigger and eats more, but the wife insists on 50-50 because they're supposed to be equals. The husband also mentions that he takes her to sushi places, but he orders kids' meals while she gets the expensive ones. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze each side. The wife's argument is about equality\u2014each getting half. The husband's point is about physical needs and past sacrifices (like letting her have better sushi). But the husband's plan is to let her eat her half first and then take from it, which might not be fair.\n\nThe key here is fairness and mutual respect. The wife is setting a boundary by agreeing to the pizza only if it's split equally. The husband, while having his own reasoning, is planning to circumvent her rules. That could be seen as disrespectful. Even if he believes his reasoning is fair, he's not honoring her terms. \n\nAlso, the husband's approach\u2014letting her eat until she's full but then taking from her portion\u2014might be seen as manipulative. It's possible that the wife's insistence on equality is her way of balancing things out, especially considering the sushi situation where he pays for her better meals but gets cheaper ones for himself. Maybe she feels the pizza should be split evenly as a form of fairness in their shared expenses. \n\nSo, the husband is prioritizing his own desires while disregarding the agreed-upon terms. That does make him the asshole because he's not respecting the compromise she set. Even if the split feels unfair to him, he should have discussed it or found another solution instead of going behind her back. The answer would be A.\n"
