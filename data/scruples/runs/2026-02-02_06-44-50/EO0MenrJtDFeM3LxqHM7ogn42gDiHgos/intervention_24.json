My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person in this situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again carefully.\n\nThe person is ordering a pizza, which they love because it's from their home country. They mention that their wife doesn't like them getting pizza because it's unhealthy and expensive in Japan. They found a coupon and got her permission to buy it for dinner. Now, the wife wants half the pizza each, but the author thinks 60-40 is fair because they're taller and bigger, eating more. The author also notes that they order sushi four times a year, taking her to a nice place but choosing cheaper kid's menu items, while encouraging her to get the more expensive ones. The plan is to let the wife eat her half until she's full, then eat the rest of her share, leaving her with natto for breakfast instead of leftovers.\n\nFirst, the user says they think the author is in the wrong but are curious about my opinion. The key points here are the fairness of splitting the pizza, the wife's insistence on equality, and the author's counterargument based on body size and eating habits. Then there's the part about sushi, where the author is paying for something the wife likes but choosing cheaper options for themselves. The author's plan to take the leftovers is part of their reasoning for not splitting equally.\n\nSo, the main question is about whether expecting 60-40 is justified. The author's argument is based on physical size and actual consumption, but the wife wants equal halves. The user is asking if the author is wrong for not agreeing to split 50-50 despite the wife's reasoning of equality.\n\nI should consider cultural norms around sharing and equality in relationships. The wife might feel that being equal partners means splitting things evenly, regardless of individual needs. The author, however, is arguing that their body size and appetite make a 60-40 split more just. But then, when it comes to sushi, the author is paying for the experience but not sharing the same way\u2014choosing cheaper items for themselves while letting the wife have the expensive ones. That could be a point of contention. The wife might feel that the author is being unfair in other contexts, which could be why she's pushing for equal pizza portions. \n\nAlso, the author's plan to take the leftovers is a bit sneaky. The wife eats her half, and the author then takes the remaining part. This could be seen as not respecting her autonomy or agreement. If they agreed on 50-50, the author is going against that by taking more. Even if the wife eats less, the author is deciding to override her share, which might be seen as manipulative or not honoring the initial agreement.\n\nIn relationships, equality can be subjective. The wife might value equal sharing of expenses and food as a sign of partnership, while the author is prioritizing actual consumption needs. There's also the aspect of the author making exceptions in other areas (sushi) where they don't split equally, but the wife does appreciate those expensive items. The inconsistency here might be a problem. The author is paying for the sushi but not sharing the same way, which the wife might find contradictory. \n\nSo, if the author is okay with the wife having more expensive sushi, why isn't the wife okay with the author having more pizza? Maybe the author should consider the wife's perspective on equality. The wife might feel that the author is being self-centered by taking more pizza, especially since they agreed to the purchase under the condition of equal split. The author's method of taking leftovers after the wife is done might not be respectful. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong because they're not respecting the agreed-upon split the wife wants, even though their reasoning is about consumption. Relationships often involve compromise and respecting each other's values, even if they don't personally agree. The wife's insistence on half each is about equality, and the author's plan to take more undermines that. So, answer A.\n"
