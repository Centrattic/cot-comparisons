My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the pizza-sharing situation is in the wrong. The story goes that the author wants to order a large pizza using a coupon, but his wife insists on splitting it 50-50. The author argues that since he's bigger and eats more, 60-40 is fair. He mentions that he orders pizza 4 times a year and also takes her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, but he doesn't get the same from her, as he's ordering cheaper sushi while she gets the expensive stuff. The author plans to let her eat her fill, which he expects would be less than half, and then eat the rest himself.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's actions are wrong. The key points here are fairness, mutual respect, and communication. The wife has given permission for the pizza, so the author isn't violating her wishes by ordering it. However, the main conflict is about the division. The author's rationale is based on body size and eating habits, but the wife's argument is about equality. \n\nIn relationships, equality often extends to respecting each other's preferences and boundaries, even if they don't align with practical considerations like body size. The author is trying to negotiate a different split based on his needs, which might be reasonable in some contexts, but the wife's stance seems to be about fairness in the relationship, not just the meal. \n\nThe author's plan to let her eat until she's full and then take the rest could be seen as manipulative or dismissive of her stated agreement. If she's insisting on half for herself, and he's going to take more regardless, it could lead to resentment. The author's approach might undermine the trust and mutual respect that's important in a relationship. \n\nAdditionally, while the author mentions taking her to sushi, he's also choosing cheaper options for himself, which might not be equal. However, the pizza issue is a separate matter. The core issue is whether splitting the pizza 50-50 is fair. The author's argument for 60-40 is based on personal needs, but the wife's insistence on equality might be about treating each other as equals in the relationship, not just in food portions. \n\nIn many relationships, fairness isn't always about splitting things equally in a physical sense, but about mutual agreement and respect. The author's decision to go against her wishes, even if he thinks it's fair, could be seen as not respecting her boundaries. The fact that he plans to take more than his \"fair share\" while she eats less might lead to her feeling taken advantage of. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because he's not respecting his wife's terms for the agreement. Even if he has a logical reason, the wife's demand for equality is her preference, and the author's plan to disregard it could be seen as disrespectful. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
