My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. So I need to analyze the situation.\n\nThe author wants to order a large pizza, which they love, and they got permission from their wife using a coupon. The wife insists on splitting it 50-50, but the author thinks 60-40 is fair because they're bigger and eat more. The author also mentions that they take the wife to sushi 4 times a year, letting her order expensive plates while they stick to cheaper ones. The author plans to let the wife eat her half first, then take the leftovers, even if she's not full, and not feel bad about it.\n\nHmm, so the key points are about fairness in sharing and mutual respect. The wife's argument is about equality, maybe seeing the pizza as a shared expense or a shared meal. The author's reasoning is based on physical size and consumption needs, but they do acknowledge that they order sushi for her, showing they consider her preferences.\n\nBut when it comes to splitting the pizza, the wife's stance is about equal shares. The author is planning to take more, which could be seen as taking advantage, even if they think it's fair. The wife's demand for equality might be part of a broader dynamic in their relationship. The author's plan to take leftovers from her half could be seen as disrespectful or not honoring the agreed split. Even if the author got permission to order the pizza, the way they want to handle the distribution might be the problem. The AITA community often looks at intentions and respect in relationships, so the author might be in the wrong for disregarding their wife's wishes despite the compromise she's made (allowing the pizza order in the first place). \n\nSo, the answer might be A, but I need to make sure. The wife's insistence on equality could be about fairness in the relationship, not just the pizza. The author's approach might be seen as selfish, even if their reasoning is about size. The key here is mutual respect and compromise. Since the wife has agreed to the pizza but wants an equal share, the author's plan to take more could be the issue. So, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
