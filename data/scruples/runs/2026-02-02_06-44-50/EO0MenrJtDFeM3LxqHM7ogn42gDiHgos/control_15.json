My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a pizza division between them and their wife. The author ordered a pizza using a coupon with the wife's permission. They want 60-40 split, but the wife insists on half each. The author argues they eat more due to being taller and bigger. They also mention other times they balance things, like taking her to sushi.\n\nFirst, I need to assess fairness. The wife agreed to the pizza being ordered, so the author isn't wrong about that. The disagreement is about the split. The author's reasoning is based on their physical needs, but the wife sees it as equality. \n\nIn relationships, fairness can be subjective. The author's argument is about practical needs, but the wife's stance is about equal sharing. The fact that they have had this discussion before suggests a recurring issue. The author's plan to take the remaining pizza after she's done might be seen as underhanded or not respecting her wishes, even if they think it's fair.\n\nThe author also mentions they balance things by taking her to sushi, but that's not directly related to the pizza issue. The key point is whether expecting a 60-40 split is reasonable. While the author's reasoning is based on their body size, it's possible that the wife feels entitled to equal portions regardless of that. \n\nThe author's approach to taking the leftovers might lead to conflict, and not considering the wife's feelings could be seen as inconsiderate. Even if the author doesn't feel guilty, it might affect their relationship. So, the answer would depend on whether respecting mutual agreement is more important than individual needs. Since the wife has a right to her perspective, the author might be in the wrong for not accommodating her wishes, even if they have their own reasoning.\n"
