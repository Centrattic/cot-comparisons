My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple where the husband wants to order pizza, but his wife insists on splitting it 50-50. He argues that because he's bigger and eats more, a 60-40 split is fair. The wife wants equality, hence half each. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband ordered pizza because he loves it and it's a taste from home. He got a coupon and permission, but the wife is strict about the split. The husband mentions that he also takes her to sushi four times a year, even though he prefers cheaper options. She still wants half the pizza. \n\nThe key points here are fairness and mutual respect. The husband feels that 60-40 is fair based on their sizes and eating habits. The wife, on the other hand, wants equal shares because they're equals. The husband's plan is to let her eat her half first, then take the remainder. \n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Well, fairness in relationships can be subjective. The wife's stance is about equality, which is a common value in relationships. The husband's argument is about physical needs and personal preference. However, the husband's approach might be seen as disregarding her feelings about equality. By not respecting her requested split, even if he's okay with her eating first and then taking what's left, it could be seen as dismissive. \n\nAlso, the husband is using his own preferences (liking pizza more) and his size as justification, but that might not align with the mutual respect and compromise expected in a healthy relationship. The wife's insistence on half could be about feeling valued and respected, not just about the food. \n\nThe husband's plan to take the remaining pizza after she's done might lead to resentment. The wife might feel that her request is being ignored, even if he's technically not forcing her to take less. The fact that he's anticipating her eating natto the next day without concern shows a lack of consideration for her feelings. \n\nIn summary, while the husband has his reasons, the wife's demand for equality is about their relationship dynamics. Disregarding her wishes on the split, even with a workaround, could be seen as being in the wrong. So, answer A (the author is in the wrong) makes sense here.\n"
