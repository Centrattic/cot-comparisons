My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the given situation is the asshole (AITA), and the options are A or B.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is planning to order a large pizza using a coupon they found. The wife has agreed because of the coupon, but she expects half the pizza. The author thinks 60-40 is fair because they eat more, being taller and bigger. The wife has previously insisted on equal halves. The author then plans to let her eat as much as she wants first, take the leftover of her half, and leave her with natto for breakfast instead of leftover pizza. They don't want to feel guilty about this.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious about the assistant's opinion. \n\nKey points to consider: The wife agreed to the pizza purchase using the coupon, but the division is half each. The author's reasoning is based on their physical size and consumption, but the wife values equality. The author's plan to take more after she eats her fill could lead to her not having enough for breakfast, which might be a sign of disrespect. \n\nIn relationships, fairness often involves mutual respect and compromise. Even if the author eats more, the wife's expectation of equality might be about respecting her preferences. The author's manipulation by letting her eat first but planning to take from her leftovers shows a lack of good faith. The wife agreed to the purchase under the condition of splitting it, and the author is essentially planning to undermine that agreement. \n\nThe sushi part is a bit tricky. The author takes her to sushi but eats cheap plates, which might show they consider her preferences, but that's not directly related to the pizza issue. The main problem is the unequal division without mutual agreement. \n\nSo, the author is trying to justify taking more by citing their size, but the wife's insistence on equality is a valid perspective. The plan to let her eat first and then take the rest of her half is underhanded. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
