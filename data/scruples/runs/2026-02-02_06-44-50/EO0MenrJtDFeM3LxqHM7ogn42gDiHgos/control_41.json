My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is about splitting a pizza. The wife says half each, but the author thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more. The wife wants equality, so half each.\n\nFirst, the author got permission to buy the pizza with a coupon. The wife agreed to that. Now, the issue is the division. The author argues that his body size means he needs more, but the wife is pushing for equal shares. \n\nThe author also mentions that they both have times where they take the other out for their preferred food. He takes her to sushi, she might take him to pizza? But he only orders pizza 4 times a year. He's trying to balance things by letting her have her sushi preferences, and he's okay with the kid's menu because he doesn't like the expensive stuff. But he still wants more pizza.\n\nThe wife's stance is equality. She might feel that despite their different appetites, they should share equally. The author plans to let her eat her half first and then take the rest. That could be seen as sneaky. Maybe it's about fairness versus equality. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if the wife agreed to the purchase but expects an equal split, and the author is going against that, maybe he's not respecting her wishes. Even if he thinks it's fair, she's set a boundary. The author's plan to outsmart her by eating the leftover pizza after she's done might come off as manipulative. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is based on physical needs, but maybe the wife values equal sharing regardless of appetite. Since they're a couple, maybe communication is the key. The author could try to explain his side again, but instead, he's planning to go against her wishes. That might make him the asshole here. \n\nSo the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because he's not respecting the agreed-upon split and is planning to circumvent it.\n"
