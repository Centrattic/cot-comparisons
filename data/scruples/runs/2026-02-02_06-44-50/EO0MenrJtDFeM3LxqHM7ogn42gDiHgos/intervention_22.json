My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the pizza scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author wants to split the pizza 60-40 in their favor, while the wife insists on 50-50. The author argues based on their size and appetite, but the wife wants equality. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author and wife are in a relationship. They made a deal where the author could get pizza using a coupon. The wife agreed to the purchase but expects half. The author feels that because he's bigger and eats more, 60-40 is fair. The wife's reasoning is equality.\n\nSo, is equality the main point here? The wife might see the deal as a compromise: he gets to have pizza once a year, so she's entitled to half. The author's counter is based on their physical needs. But maybe this is a recurring issue. The author mentions this happens four times a year. If the wife keeps insisting on half each time, maybe there's an underlying issue about fairness in their relationship.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that he takes her to sushi four times a year as a gesture. But in return, he expects more pizza. So it's a trade-off. But if the wife is not getting her desired half, maybe she feels it's not balanced. The author's plan to take her half after she's done is manipulative, though. Letting her eat her half first and then taking the leftovers is a way to get more without directly defying her. But is that fair?\n\nThe concept of fairness is subjective. In relationships, compromise is key. The author is making a case for fairness based on appetite, but the wife sees it as equality. If the wife agreed to the purchase, maybe she expected a fair split. However, the author might be overstepping by not respecting her boundary. The wife's insistence could be about equality, but the author's response is about personal needs. \n\nThe author's plan to take leftovers is a way to get around the agreement, which might be seen as dishonest. Even if he's not directly taking more at the moment, he's planning to take advantage of her eating habits. That could be considered inconsiderate. The key is whether the author's actions respect the agreed-upon compromise. The wife's half is a condition for her agreeing to the pizza. If he goes around that, he's not honoring the deal. \n\nSo, from a relationship standpoint, respecting agreed terms is important. The author's reasoning is logical, but relationships often require emotional understanding and compromise. The wife might feel that if he's allowed to take more, the next time she might have to make a similar concession, leading to resentment. The author's approach might not be wrong in terms of logic, but in the context of the relationship, it's about mutual respect and agreements. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he's not respecting the agreed split, even if his reasoning is based on his own needs.\n"
