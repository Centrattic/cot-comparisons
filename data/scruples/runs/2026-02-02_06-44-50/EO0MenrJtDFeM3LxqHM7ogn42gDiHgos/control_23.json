My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about splitting a pizza with the wife. The author wants 60% and the wife insists on exactly half each. The author justifies this because he's taller, bigger, and eats more. The wife argues for equality.\n\nFirst, the author got permission to order pizza using a coupon, which the wife allowed. So he's not breaking any rules here. The main issue is the division. The wife wants half, but the author thinks 60-40 is fair. The key points here are about fairness and mutual respect. \n\nThe author mentions that he takes her to a nice sushi place four times a year, where he eats cheap kid's meals while she can have the expensive ones. He does this because he knows she likes it more. But when it comes to pizza, she's not allowing him to have more of his preferred food. That seems a bit inconsistent. \n\nThe author's plan is to let the wife eat until she's full, which would be less than half, then take the remaining. He's not forcing her to eat all her half, but if she doesn't, he'll take the leftovers. The wife, on the other hand, is set on getting exactly half regardless of how much she actually eats. \n\nIs it fair to split based on body size? Maybe, but that can be subjective. However, the wife gave him permission to order the pizza, so maybe she's okay with him having more. The author is trying to share the food he likes, which she's not as fond of, but she's not reciprocating in the sushi scenario. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the wife agreed to the pizza purchase but expects a 50-50 split, but the author is adjusting based on his eating habits, it's a matter of mutual agreement. The author isn't being unfair if he's giving her the chance to eat as much as she wants, then taking the rest. The wife's insistence on equality might be more about control than fairness. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. The author is trying to accommodate her preferences (by taking her to sushi) even if it's not his favorite. She's not doing the same with pizza. So maybe he's not in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
