My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting more than half the pizza. The situation is that the author ordered a pizza with a coupon, got permission from their wife, and now wants 60% of it because they're bigger and eat more. The wife wants half each, citing equality. The author plans to let her eat her half, but if she doesn't finish it, he'll take the leftovers.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about fairness and mutual agreement. The wife agreed to the pizza purchase but expects equal division. The author feels that their physical size and eating habits justify a different split. The question is whether the author is being unreasonable.\n\nThe wife's argument is about equality\u2014since they're a couple, splitting things equally is fair. The author's counter is that their bodies and appetites differ, so splitting 60-40 is more equitable. The author also mentions they reciprocate by taking her to sushi, but she insists on equal pizza portions.\n\nNow, in relationships, fairness can be subjective. The wife might see equal division as fair, regardless of differences in appetite. The author is trying to do what he thinks is fair based on his needs. However, the author's plan to take the leftovers after she's done eating might be seen as underhanded. Even if he's not wrong in his reasoning, the method of taking her leftovers without her consent could be problematic. It might come off as manipulative or not respecting her initial agreement.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they don't plan to feel bad about the leftovers, which shows a lack of consideration for her feelings or potential disappointment. This could be where the author is in the wrong\u2014not in the initial desire for a different split, but in the approach of taking advantage of their arrangement.\n\nSo considering both perspectives: the author's reasoning isn't entirely unreasonable, but the method of enforcing the unequal split despite her agreement to half each might be. The key is mutual respect and communication. If the wife agreed to the pizza, maybe they could compromise, like he takes a bit more but not 60%, or she takes less. However, the author's plan to take her leftovers without discussing it further could be the issue. So maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because of the way he's going about it, not just the split itself.\n"
