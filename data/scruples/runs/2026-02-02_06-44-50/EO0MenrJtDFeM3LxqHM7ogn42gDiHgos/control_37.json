My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting a pizza with their wife. The wife says half is hers, but the author thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more. The author also mentions he orders pizza 4 times a year and takes her to sushi places, but she still insists on the 50-50 split.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about fairness and mutual respect in a relationship. The wife gave permission to order pizza with a coupon, so she's okay with the purchase. The disagreement is about the portion. The author argues that because he's taller and eats more, 60-40 is fair. But the wife expects equality. \n\nNow, in relationships, fairness can be subjective. The author is willing to let her eat her half first and then take from it when he's done. But that might not be fair to her. If he takes the remaining, she might end up with less or nothing. Also, the author mentions he's going to make her eat natto instead of leftover pizza, which seems a bit harsh. \n\nThe wife's perspective is that they should be equals, so half each. The author is not respecting her request and is planning to take more, which could be seen as being inconsiderate. Even if he eats more, agreed-upon terms are part of mutual respect. If the wife has a rule, and he's going against it without discussion, maybe he's the one being the asshole. \n\nAlso, the author's plan to take her half after she's done might not be fair. It's a bit manipulative. Maybe a better solution would be to split it 50-50 as agreed, or find another way to accommodate both. The author is prioritizing his own needs over her rules, which might be the issue. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's not respecting the agreed-upon terms and his plan is unfair to his wife. But maybe some would say B, thinking it's about personal preferences and body size. But in a relationship, mutual respect and agreement are important. If the wife wants half, and he's going to take more, that's a problem. So I think A is the right choice here.\n"
