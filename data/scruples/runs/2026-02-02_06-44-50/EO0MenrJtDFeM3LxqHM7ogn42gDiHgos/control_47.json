My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the person is asking if they're in the wrong for expecting more than half the pizza when they order it. They mentioned their wife doesn't like them getting pizza because it's unhealthy and expensive. They used a coupon to get her permission, and now she's saying half is hers. The user is bigger and eats more, so they think 60-40 is fair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider their points. The wife's main issues seem to be health and cost. The user orders pizza 4 times a year, which isn't that frequent. They also take her to sushi, which she likes, but the user prefers cheaper options. The user wants to have more pizza because they eat more. The wife wants equal halves, citing equality. The user's plan is to let her eat her half until she's full and then take the leftovers, which they feel is fair.\n\nNow, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. The wife is setting boundaries about shared expenses and health, so she might be trying to split the cost or manage portions. The user is using a coupon, which might mean the cost is less of an issue now. But splitting the pizza equally could be her way of ensuring they both eat the same amount, even if they have different appetites. The user's argument is based on body size and eating habits, which could be seen as practical. However, the wife's insistence on equality might be about fairness in sharing, not just quantity. \n\nThere's a potential issue with the user's plan to take leftovers after she eats her half. That might come off as sneaky or not respecting her share. The wife might feel that if she's allowed to have her half first, but the user takes the rest, it undermines the agreement. Also, the user mentions that they encourage her to order expensive sushi, which she does, but the pizza situation is different. Maybe the wife is used to splitting things equally, so expecting the same here. \n\nThe user's reasoning is practical, but the action of overriding the agreed-upon split might be seen as disrespectful. Even if they think they can eat more, the wife's request for half is about equality. The user's approach could be manipulative, leading to resentment. The key is mutual respect and negotiation. If they had a conversation and agreed on a different split, that would be better. But taking leftovers without consent might be the problem. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they're not respecting their wife's agreed-upon share and are planning to take extra without discussing it. Therefore, answer A.\n"
