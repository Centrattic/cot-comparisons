My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a pizza order where the author and their wife are splitting it 50-50, but the author thinks a 60-40 split is fair because they are bigger and eat more. The wife insists on half each, and the author plans to take the leftover half after she's done.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The wife allowed the pizza because of the coupon and the author's love for it, but she still wants half. The author argues based on body size and eating habits. The wife's reasoning is about equality. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. The user is asking for a judgment based on social norms or fairness. The wife's stance is on equality, which is a common perspective in relationships. However, the author is considering their own higher caloric needs. \n\nBut wait, the author also takes her to a sushi place, and encourages her to order more expensive items. That might balance things out. The wife might be trying to maintain some kind of fairness in how they split the expenses or portions. \n\nThe author's plan to take her leftover half after she's full could be seen as taking advantage. If the wife eats her half and then the author takes more, maybe that's not fair. But the author's argument is that the wife eats less than half, so the rest is wasted. However, the wife might prefer to have her own half, even if she doesn't finish it. \n\nIn many relationships, splitting things equally is a way to ensure both feel respected and valued. The wife might feel that if she's allowed to have pizza (which she doesn't like), she should get her portion. The author's counterargument is about physical needs, but that's a personal preference. \n\nIs it about equality in sharing or equality in effort? The wife might think they're splitting the meal equally because they shared the cost. The author's idea of fairness is based on consumption, but that's not necessarily the standard. \n\nAlso, the author's plan to let the wife have her fill first but then take the rest might not be what the wife intended. She might have wanted to eat her half and leave the rest for him, but the author is taking it regardless. \n\nSo, while the author has a point about their own appetite, the wife's insistence on equal portions could be about feeling equally treated in the relationship, not just about the food. The author's approach might come off as dismissive of her feelings about equality. \n\nTherefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because respecting a partner's wishes, even if you think your reasoning is logical, is important. The wife's demand for half could be a way to feel involved or equal, and the author's plan might undermine that.\n"
