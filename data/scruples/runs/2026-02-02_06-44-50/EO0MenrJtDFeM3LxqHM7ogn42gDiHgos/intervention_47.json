My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author wants to order a pizza but their wife is against it because it's unhealthy and expensive. They found a coupon and got permission, but the wife insists on splitting it 50-50. The author argues they should have 60% because they're bigger and eat more. They also mention that they take her to sushi four times a year, where they order cheaper options while she gets the more expensive ones. The author plans to let her eat her half until she's full, then take the rest of her half, leaving her with natto for breakfast.\n\nHmm. The main issue is about fairness in the division. The wife wants equal halves, but the author thinks it should be based on their appetites. The author also brings up the sushi example as a way they balance things out. But the wife is insisting on equality in the pizza. \n\nI wonder if the problem is about communication. Maybe the wife feels that splitting equally is fair because they're equals in the relationship, regardless of appetite. The author is countering with physical needs. But maybe the wife's stance is about fairness in sharing the expense, not just the amount eaten. Since the pizza was bought with a coupon, maybe she's trying to manage the budget. The author's plan to take more than half sounds like they're disregarding her consent, even if she agreed to the order. They said she gave permission to buy it, but she expected a 50-50 split. If the author goes against that, is it violating her terms?\n\nAlso, the author's response of letting her eat until full and then taking the rest might not be respectful. It's a bit manipulative because they're using her own portion. The wife might feel cheated, even if she eats less. The breakfast part with natto seems like a punishment, which isn't great. \n\nSo maybe the author is in the wrong because they're not respecting the wife's terms for the shared expense, even if they think they're more deserving. Relationships often require compromise, and the wife might see equal sharing as part of that compromise. The sushi example is a bit of a defense, but maybe the key here is that the wife consented to the order but not the unequal division. The author's plan undermines that agreement. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
