My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about dividing a pizza with their wife. The author ordered a large pizza because they like to eat a lot, not for value. The wife wants half each, but the author thinks 60-40 is fair because they're bigger and eat more. The author also mentions other times they compromise, like taking her to sushi places where they order cheaper, but encourage her to order expensive.\n\nFirst, the wife set the condition that half the pizza is each person's. The author, even though they were given permission, is going to ignore that and take more. But the wife's reasoning is about equality, even though they aren't the same in physical size. The author argues that their size and appetite mean equal division isn't fair. However, the wife's stance is based on the principle of equality, not on physical differences. \n\nIn relationships, fairness can be subjective. The author does make efforts to accommodate their wife's preferences in other areas (sushi), but here they're using a different logic. The problem might be about respecting agreed-upon terms versus personal needs. The wife might feel that if she agreed to the pizza under the 50-50 condition, the author not following it could be seen as dishonest or not respecting her terms. Even if the author's intention is to let the wife eat her fill first, then take the rest, it's still not honoring the initial agreement. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they'll let her eat natto instead of leftover pizza the next morning. That could be perceived as punishment for not splitting the pizza as agreed. The wife's expectation of equality might be more about mutual respect and understanding rather than the actual amount consumed. The author's approach might come off as keeping track of contributions and expecting something in return, which can lead to resentment. \n\nSo, while the author might have a valid point about their appetite, the fact that the wife wanted an equal split and the author is going to go against that agreement without discussing it first could make them the asshole. The key issue is respecting the terms of the agreement rather than justifying their actions based on personal needs. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
