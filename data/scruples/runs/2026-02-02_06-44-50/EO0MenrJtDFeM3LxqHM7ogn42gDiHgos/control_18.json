My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The husband wants to order a pizza, got a coupon with his wife's permission. He wants a large pizza because he likes eating a lot, not for value. The wife says half and half, but he thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more. He mentions that he brings her to sushi 4 times a year, but he's not into expensive sushi, so he orders cheap plates while she gets the good stuff. The wife still wants half the pizza. His plan is to let her eat until she's full (probably less than half), then take the rest of her half. He's okay with her having natto instead of leftover pizza the next day and doesn't feel bad.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about fairness and mutual respect in a relationship. The wife feels that equality means splitting the pizza 50-50. The husband argues that his body size and appetite mean he should get more. But relationships often involve compromise beyond just physical needs. The fact that she agreed to the pizza in the first place shows she's making a concession. The husband, in turn, takes her to sushi as a gesture. \n\nBut his reasoning for not giving her half is based on his own needs, and his plan to take more than he should even if she's okay with eating less. This seems like he's prioritizing his own desires over the agreed-upon compromise. Even if he's hungrier, once a deal is made, going back on it could be seen as not respecting the other's wishes. \n\nAlso, the husband's attitude about her having to eat natto and not feeling bad about it might come off as dismissive. It's important to acknowledge that the wife's preference for equality in sharing things is part of their relationship dynamic. The husband's actions could lead to resentment, even if he thinks he's justified.\n\nSo, while the husband has his reasons, the wife's insistence on equal sharing is about fairness in the relationship, not just about food. The husband is ignoring her established boundary and planning to undermine it, which could be seen as disrespectful. Therefore, he might be in the wrong.\n"
