My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about pizza sharing between a husband and wife. The author wants 60-40 split because he's taller and bigger, while his wife wants half each. He argues that he eats more, but she insists on equality. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife allowed him to order pizza because he found a coupon, showing some compromise. The author mentions that he also takes her to sushi places and encourages her to order expensive dishes, which he doesn't like. That seems like he's being considerate of her preferences. However, when it comes to pizza, he's pushing for a more unequal split.\n\nThe key point here is the concept of fairness. The wife wants equal halves because they are supposed to be equals, while the author thinks physical size justifies a 60-40 split. The author's plan is to let her eat her half, but then take the rest if she's done before he is. This could be seen as manipulative or not respecting her agreement. \n\nAlso, the author's approach of not feeling bad about making her eat natto instead of leftover pizza might come off as selfish. Even if he's eating more, the act of not sharing the leftovers could be hurtful. The wife might feel her share is being taken away after she's done eating. \n\nThe author might not be wrong in wanting a larger portion, but the way he's handling it\u2014by not respecting her agreement and planning to take more after she's done\u2014could be the problem. It's about mutual respect and compromise in a relationship. Insisting on his own terms without considering her feelings might make him the asshole. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not respecting the agreed-upon split and is being manipulative. Alternatively, if the wife's insistence on equal halves is unreasonable given the husband's needs, it could be B. But overall, the act of not honoring the agreed split and the plan to take more after she's done seems like the issue.\n"
