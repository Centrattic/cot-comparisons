My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about pizza sharing between a husband and wife. The husband ordered a pizza using a coupon with the wife's permission. He wants 60-40 split because he's bigger and eats more, but the wife insists on 50-50. The husband's argument is based on physical size and eating habits, but the wife sees it as equality.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the principles of fairness and equality in relationships. The wife might feel that splitting things equally is about mutual respect and not just physical needs. The husband's reasoning is that he eats more, so he deserves a larger portion. But the wife sees them as equals, so each should get the same. \n\nThe husband's plan to take the remaining half after she's done eating seems sneaky. Even if she eats less, he's taking what she didn't finish without her consent. That could be seen as dishonest or manipulative. The wife might have agreed to half each expecting that to be the deal, and the husband is circumventing that. \n\nAlso, the fact that he brings her to a nice sushi place four times a year but eats cheaper options might be a point. The wife might appreciate the gesture, but if he's not reciprocating in the same way with pizza, maybe that's a different issue. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. The husband isn't compromising; he's trying to get around her decision. Even if his reasoning is logical (body size), relationships often require emotional and social considerations beyond just physical needs. Insisting on 60-40 despite her stance could be seen as not respecting her feelings about equality. The husband's plan to take the leftovers without her consent is probably the main issue here. \n\nSo, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong. The correct choice is A.\n"
