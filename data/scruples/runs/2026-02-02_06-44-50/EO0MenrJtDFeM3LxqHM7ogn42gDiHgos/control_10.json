My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the pizza situation is in the wrong. The story is about a husband and wife disagreeing on how to split a pizza. The husband wants a 60-40 split in his favor because he's bigger and eats more, while the wife insists on a 50-50 split, citing equality. The husband feels justified because he also spends time and money on sushi for her, but she still wants half the pizza.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband ordered pizza because he loves it and found a coupon with his wife's permission. The wife's main arguments are about equality and health/expense. The husband argues that their body sizes and eating habits justify an unequal split. \n\nIs the husband entitled to take more? Well, the wife agreed to the order, so he's within his rights to have the pizza. But the expectation of splitting it equally might be based on a sense of fairness or past agreements. The husband plans to take more, but he also mentions he'll let her eat her fill first. However, his strategy of eating the remainder of her half after she's done could be seen as manipulative, as he's allowing her to take more than she wants but then taking it for himself. That might not be fair, even if it's not illegal or unethical in a strict sense.\n\nEquality in relationships often involves mutual respect and compromise. The wife's insistence on half might be her way of showing fairness, while the husband's approach could be seen as disregarding her wishes. The fact that the husband takes her leftover portion could lead to her missing out on a preferred meal (natto instead of pizza), which might not be considered considerate.\n\nThe husband also mentions that they both have preferences in their meals. He orders cheaper sushi for himself but lets her have the expensive ones. That seems like a fair trade. However, the pizza situation is different because he's the one who ordered it. The wife's agreement to the purchase doesn't necessarily mean she agrees to the split. \n\nThe key issue here is whether the husband should respect his wife's stated preference for a 50-50 split. If they had a prior agreement or if the wife is clear about her expectation, not honoring that could be seen as inconsiderate. The husband's plan to outsmart her by taking her leftovers might be viewed as selfish, even if he's statistically correct in thinking she won't eat her half. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's wishes, even if they seem unequal from a logical standpoint, is important. The husband's actions might be technically not wrong, but they could harm the relationship's harmony. The wife's insistence on equality might be about feeling valued, not just about the pizza. So, the husband might be in the wrong if he doesn't respect her feelings on this matter.\n"
