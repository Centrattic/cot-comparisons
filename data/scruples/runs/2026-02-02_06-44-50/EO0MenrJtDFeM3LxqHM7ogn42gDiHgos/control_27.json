My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about pizza division between the author and his wife.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author wants to order a pizza, which his wife usually doesn't like because it's unhealthy and expensive. He found a coupon, got her permission, and ordered a large pizza. Now, the issue is how to split it. The wife wants half each, but the author thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more. He also mentions that they both have different preferences in other dining occasions, like sushi. He wants to take her half after she's done eating, which might leave her with leftovers for breakfast.\n\nSo, the key points are: mutual agreement on the purchase, differing expectations on division, and the author's plan to take more after she eats her half.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, consent was given to order the pizza, which is good. The wife's insistence on equal halves might be about fairness, but the author feels it's based on their physical needs. The author's plan to take her half after she's done might be seen as exploiting her initial agreement. However, the wife agreed to the purchase, so maybe the author is overstepping by not respecting her stated preference, even if he thinks 60-40 is fair. \n\nAlso, the author's approach of letting her eat first and then taking the remaining might be manipulative. The wife might feel her request isn't respected. The argument is about fairness and equality in a relationship. The author's reasoning is based on personal needs, but the wife's stance is on equality. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is important. The author could have discussed the 60-40 ratio again or found another solution. Since he's going to ignore her request and take more regardless, that could be seen as the asshole move. So, maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because he's not respecting her agreed-upon terms, even if he has his own reasoning.\n"
