My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author wants to order a pizza but his wife doesn't like it because it's unhealthy and expensive in Japan. He found a coupon and she gave him permission to buy it for dinner. He ordered a large one because he likes to eat a lot, not for value. The problem is that the wife wants half the pizza each, but he thinks 60/40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more. He mentions he brings her to a nice sushi place four times a year, even though he prefers cheaper options. He also plans to take her leftover pizza if she doesn't finish her half, making her eat natto instead. The question is whether he's the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, the key points here. The wife allowed him to order pizza with the coupon, which suggests some compromise. The author's argument is based on his size and appetite. However, the wife's insistence on equal halves is about equality in the relationship. The author's counter-plan is to let her eat her half, then take the leftovers, which could be seen as manipulative or undermining her choice.\n\nI need to consider fairness and mutual respect. The wife might feel that sharing equally is about fairness in the relationship, regardless of physical differences. The author's reasoning is practical (body size and eating habits), but the wife's stance is on equality. The fact that he's already compromising by ordering pizza (which she doesn't love) and taking her to sushi might balance things, but he still wants an unequal share. Also, his plan to take her leftovers seems like he's trying to get around her wishes, which could be disrespectful.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the wife is trying to enforce equality in shared meals as a principle. The author is pushing back based on personal needs. But if they agreed to split it 50/50, maybe he's not respecting her terms. Even if he eats more, if she's okay with the terms, maybe he should honor that. His plan to take her leftovers after she eats her half could be seen as sneaky, especially if she ends up with less than she wanted. It might also be about control. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife might be being unreasonable if his appetite is genuinely bigger. But in relationships, sometimes agreements are about fairness in the relationship dynamic, not just physical needs. The author might be in the wrong if he's not respecting her terms even after she gave permission. The fact that he's planning to circumvent her wishes by taking leftovers could be seen as the asshole move. So, maybe A is the answer. But I need to be careful. The key is whether his actions are inconsiderate or disrespectful. If the wife set the terms, even if he disagrees, he should follow through. His plan to take the leftovers without her consent could be the issue. So, the answer is A.\n"
