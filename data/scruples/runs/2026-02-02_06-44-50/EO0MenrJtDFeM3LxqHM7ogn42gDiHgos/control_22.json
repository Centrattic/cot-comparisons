My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting a pizza between the author and their wife. The author wants to have 60% of the pizza because they're bigger and eat more, but the wife insists on splitting it 50-50. The author plans to let the wife eat her half first, then take the leftovers, even if that means she can't eat any leftover pizza the next day. They also mention that they take her to a nice sushi place four times a year, which she likes, but they order cheap plates for themselves. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is being unreasonable. The key points are fairness in sharing, respect for each other's preferences, and whether the author's actions are considerate.\n\nThe wife gave permission to buy the pizza, so that's a start. But she expects half. The author argues that their body size and appetite justify a 60-40 split. However, the wife's stance is that equality means splitting it equally. The author is planning to take more than half, which might be seen as unfair or inconsiderate, especially if the wife is left with nothing the next day. \n\nThe author also mentions that they take the wife to sushi, but they order cheap plates. Maybe that's a point where the wife feels she's not getting her fair share in other areas, but the issue here is the pizza split. The author's plan to let the wife eat first but then take the leftovers could be seen as manipulative or not respecting her share. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if both are supposed to be equal, the 50-50 split might be expected. The author's reasoning is based on physical needs, but unless the wife is intentionally eating less to let him have more, it's not necessarily a problem. However, the author is planning to take more, which the wife might see as taking advantage. \n\nThe part about the wife having to eat natto instead of leftover pizza the next day is a bit harsh. It shows the author is willing to let the wife suffer for the next day to get their way. That might be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, while the author has a point about their appetite and body size, the way they're handling the situation\u2014planning to take the leftovers and not feeling bad about it\u2014could be seen as the asshole move. The wife's demand for equal halves might be about fairness and equality in the relationship, not just about food. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they're being inconsiderate of their wife's expectations and planning to make her eat natto the next day as a consequence. The answer should be A.\n"
