My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the husband wants more than half the pizza, and the wife insists on splitting it 50-50. The husband argues that he's bigger and eats more, so 60-40 is fair. The wife keeps pushing for equal shares despite his reasoning. The husband plans to let her eat her half until she's full, then take the leftovers.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider if the husband is in the wrong here. The key points are about fairness and respect in their relationship. The wife agreed to the coupon and permission to buy pizza, so that's a given. The issue is the division. The husband's argument is based on his size and appetite, but the wife feels that equality is important, as they are equals. \n\nThe husband's plan to take the leftovers after she's done might be seen as a bit sneaky. Even if he's trying to get more, the way he's doing it by letting her have her \"half\" first but then taking what's left could make her feel disrespected. The wife's insistence on 50-50 might be about fairness in the relationship dynamics, not just the pizza. If the husband's approach leads to her having to eat natto instead of pizza, maybe he's not considering her feelings or the compromise they made by allowing the pizza in the first place. \n\nAlso, the husband mentions taking her to sushi 4 times a year, which shows he tries to accommodate her. But the pizza is his preference. The problem arises when their personal preferences collide, and the wife wants equality. The husband's solution might be seen as undermining her request for equality. Even if he's bigger, in a relationship, mutual respect often involves acknowledging each other's needs and preferences, even if they don't perfectly align with one's own.\n\nSo, the husband is trying to enforce a different ratio without mutual agreement. The wife has already stated her position, and he's not respecting that. His plan to take the leftovers after she's done is a way to get around her share, which might be seen as manipulative. Therefore, the husband is in the wrong because he's not respecting his wife's request for equality and is being sneaky about it instead of finding a compromise or discussing it more openly. The answer should be A.\n"
