My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about dividing a pizza between the author and his wife. The wife is okay with the pizza because he found a coupon, but she expects half for each. The author thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more. The wife insists on equal halves. The author plans to let her eat her half, then take the rest of her leftovers. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The wife gave permission to buy the pizza, so that's a good start. She might be concerned about health and cost, which are valid in Japan where food can be expensive. The author mentions that he orders pizza 4 times a year and takes her to sushi 4 times a year, showing he tries to accommodate her preferences. That's a form of compromise.\n\nThe main issue is the division. The wife wants equality, which is a common approach in relationships to maintain fairness. The author argues for splitting based on size and appetite. But fairness can be subjective. In many relationships, equal sharing is expected unless both agree otherwise. The author's plan to take leftovers after she's done is sneaky and might be seen as disrespectful. Even if she eats less, taking her leftovers without consent could be a breach of trust.\n\nThe concept of equality in a relationship is important. The wife might see it as a symbolic gesture of fairness, not just about the food. If the author takes more without discussing it, it might make her feel her wishes are not respected. The author's reasoning about body size and appetite is practical, but relationships often involve mutual respect for each other's preferences, even if they don't align with practical logic.\n\nAlso, the author's plan to take her leftovers could lead to resentment. The wife might feel cheated if the author takes her share after she's done, even if she didn't finish. The act of giving permission might be conditional on equal sharing. The author's approach might undermine the wife's autonomy in that agreement.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not considering the symbolic and relational aspects of the situation. While his reasoning is logical, the relationship aspect requires respecting mutual agreements and considering the other's perspective. The wife's insistence on equality is about fairness in their shared life, not just the food. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for planning to take more than agreed without discussion.\n"
