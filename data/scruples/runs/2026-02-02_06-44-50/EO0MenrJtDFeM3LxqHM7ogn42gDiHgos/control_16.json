My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting a pizza between them and their wife. The author ordered a pizza using a coupon after getting permission from his wife. He wants 60% for himself because he's taller and eats more, but the wife insists on half each. He also mentions that he takes her to sushi 4 times a year and he orders cheaper while she has the more expensive stuff. The author plans to let her eat until she's full (which he thinks will be less than half) and then eat the rest of her half, leaving her with natto for breakfast.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points here. The main conflict is about the division of the pizza. The wife wants equal halves, the husband thinks 60-40 is fair. The husband's reasoning is based on his body size and eating habits. But fairness in relationships isn't just about physical needs, it's also about mutual respect and compromise. \n\nThe husband argues that he's being fair because he takes her to sushi and lets her have the expensive stuff. But the wife doesn't like pizza because it's unhealthy and expensive. The husband ordered it despite her disapproval, but he got permission with a coupon. The issue is the split. \n\nIs it wrong to want a different split? Well, if they agreed on a coupon allowing the purchase, but the wife's condition was half each, then the husband's plan to take more than half without her consent could be seen as going against the agreement. He's not just taking what she leaves but actively taking more, which she might see as manipulative. \n\nThe husband's plan to trick her into eating less so he can take her half is underhanded. Even if he thinks she'll only eat part of her half, he's not respecting her right to her share. The wife's insistence on equality could stem from feeling that pizza is a special treat she's allowing, so she wants to share it equally. The husband's actions might be seen as unfair because he's using his physicality as a reason to take more, which isn't a valid justification in a relationship where mutual respect and equality are important. \n\nAlso, the husband's reasoning about taking her half after she's full is a bit sneaky. It's not a straightforward split. The wife might feel that the agreement was 50-50, and his actions undermine that. Even if he ordered it, once it's agreed upon, the split should be as discussed. The husband's plan is to exploit the situation, which could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nIn relationships, fairness isn't always about what's logically necessary but about making each other feel respected. The husband might be in the wrong because he's not honoring the agreed-upon split and is being manipulative. The wife's insistence on equality might be her way of balancing the situation, especially considering her disapproval of pizza in the first place. \n\nSo, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not respecting the agreed terms and is using a tactic that could be seen as deceitful.\n"
