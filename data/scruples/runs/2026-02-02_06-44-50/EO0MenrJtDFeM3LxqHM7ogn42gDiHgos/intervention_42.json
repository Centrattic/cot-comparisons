My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on a situation where they want 60% of a pizza instead of half because they're taller and eat more. The wife wants half each.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms and expectations around sharing. The author ordered a pizza with a coupon the wife allowed, but they're arguing over the division. The wife's stance is that they should be equal, maybe because she sees it as a shared dinner. The author, on the other hand, thinks their body size justifies a bigger portion. \n\nBut wait, the author mentioned they take her to a sushi place four times a year. So maybe they balance out the meal choices. The author's plan is to let the wife eat her half until she's full and then eat what's left. However, the intention to do that might come off as manipulative or not respecting her right to decide her own portion. \n\nIs the issue about fairness or about respect? Even if the author eats more, the wife might feel her preferences are not considered. The idea of equality in the relationship could be more about mutual respect than exact halves. The author's approach might be seen as taking advantage of the situation, making the wife feel her share is being hoarded. \n\nAlso, the author's plan to make the wife eat natto for breakfast if there are leftovers might be part of the problem. It's not just about the pizza division but also about the author's attitude towards the wife's preferences. The wife's permission to order pizza was given, but maybe the author shouldn't impose their own portioning without discussion. \n\nSo, while the author has a valid point about needing more food, the way they're approaching it might be the issue. Insisting on 60/40 without compromise could be seen as not respecting the wife's consent or equality. The husband's strategy to take the leftovers seems underhanded. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because the situation emphasizes mutual respect and equality, and the husband's plan to override his wife's declared share, even if she eats less, could be perceived as not respecting her autonomy, making him the asshole.\n"
