My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about pizza sharing between a husband and wife. The husband ordered a pizza after getting a coupon and permission from his wife. He wants to have 60% and she wants half. He argues based on their body size and eating more, but she says they should be equal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They're a married couple, so this is about their personal relationship and how they handle things between themselves. The husband mentions that he took her to a nice sushi place four times a year, which he does because he knows she likes it. He even encourages her to order expensive sushi while he eats cheaper kid's plates. That seems like he's making an effort to accommodate her preferences and interests, even if they don't align with his own tastes. \n\nOn the pizza side, he's allowed to order it because he has a coupon and got permission. The wife is okay with the order but wants half. He thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more. The wife, however, insists on equal shares because of equality in the relationship. \n\nNow, the key points here might be about personal boundaries and mutual respect. The husband is planning to let her eat her half first, and then take from her portion if he's still hungry. But he's also considering making her eat natto instead of leftover pizza, which might not be her favorite, and he's not going to feel bad about it. That seems a bit manipulative or maybe even a bit petty. \n\nIn relationships, equality in sharing can be subjective. If they both gave up things for each other, like him taking her to sushi and her allowing pizza, then expecting equal sharing might be about fairness in the relationship. However, if he's eating more in general, then maybe he should be allowed to have a larger portion. But the wife's point is about equality, which is a common concept in relationships\u2014splitting things 50-50 as partners. \n\nThe husband's solution of letting her eat her half and then taking from it if he's still hungry might be seen as not respecting her boundary. If she asked for half, and he's going to take more than that, even if she eats less than half, it could be seen as him not respecting her wishes. Also, the part about her having to eat natto instead of pizza leftovers might be a bit of a punishment, which could be a problem. \n\nSo, the core issue is whether the husband is being fair in his own mind but not respecting his wife's boundaries. If they agreed on the terms (she allowed the pizza in exchange for her half), then not honoring that agreement might make him the asshole. The wife might feel that her initial concession (allowing the pizza) was in exchange for an equal split. \n\nAlternatively, if the husband didn't agree to the split and the wife is now holding him to it after he already got permission, maybe she's the one not being fair. But the husband does mention he's brought up the 60-40 ratio before, and she's insisted on half. So maybe he's trying to negotiate, and she's not budging. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, people often share food equally in a partnership, unless there's a specific reason to do otherwise. The husband's reasoning is based on his body size and eating more, but that's a personal preference. If the wife is okay with him getting a larger portion, maybe that's the way to go, but since she's not, he's going to have to respect that. \n\nThe part about him taking leftovers and her not being able to have them might be where the conflict lies. If he takes more than half, then she's left with nothing, which is unfair. Even if she eats less, she might have wanted to have her half saved for later. Making her eat natto instead could be seen as unfair because he's taking her share and making her do without. \n\nSo, in summary, the husband might be in the wrong because he's not respecting his wife's agreed-upon terms and is being a bit petty by taking more than his share and making her eat something she doesn't like. Even though he's making efforts for her in other areas, this specific issue about the pizza split is about mutual respect and honoring the agreement they made. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
