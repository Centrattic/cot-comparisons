My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author wants to order a large pizza, but his wife insists on splitting it 50-50. He argues that because he's bigger and eats more, a 60-40 split is fair. But the wife thinks they should be equal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author got permission to order the pizza using a coupon because it's expensive in Japan. The wife allowed it, so that's a point of agreement. The author mentions he orders pizza 4 times a year and takes her to sushi 4 times. He's trying to be considerate by encouraging her to order expensive sushi while he gets cheap plates. But when it comes to pizza, she wants half. \n\nThe author's plan is to let her eat until she's full from her half, but he'll take the rest since he's still hungry. The wife might end up missing out on pizza the next day because he's taking her leftovers. \n\nHmm. So the question is about fairness in splitting the pizza. The wife's argument is about equality, while the author's is about proportionality based on size and appetite. But since they both agreed to the pizza being ordered, maybe the initial permission is key. If the wife agreed to have pizza, then maybe she expects to share it equally. The author is using the fact that he eats more to justify taking a bigger portion, but if they were both going to eat it, maybe the wife feels that since they're sharing, it should be equal. \n\nAlso, the author's plan to take the leftovers after she's done with her half could be seen as not respecting her choice. She might have wanted to split it 50-50 to have leftovers for the next day. If he takes them all, she loses out. \n\nBut the author is also trying to balance things, giving her sushi options. However, pizza is a personal preference for him, and sushi for her. The problem is the division of the pizza. The wife might value equality in how they share the food, even if their appetites differ. The author's approach could come off as manipulative, taking advantage of the situation to get more for himself even if it means she ends up with less or nothing the next day. \n\nSo, even though the author has a point about his larger appetite, the wife's expectation of equal sharing might be based on fairness in the relationship, not just physical size. The author's plan to take her leftovers after she's done with her half is probably the main issue here. It's not just about the initial split but also about respecting her preferences and the agreement they made. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he's not respecting her terms even after she gave him permission to order the pizza.\n"
