My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the pizza situation is in the wrong. So, first, I need to understand the scenario.\n\nThe author wants to order a pizza, and his wife is okay with it because he found a coupon. The issue is about splitting the pizza. The wife wants half each, but the author thinks he should get 60% because he's bigger and eats more. He mentions that they each take the other to places they like, but he's planning to take more of the pizza by letting her eat her half first and then taking the leftovers. \n\nHmm. The key points here are about fairness and mutual agreement. The wife is asking for equality, 50-50, which is a common way to split things when people want to be equal. The author argues that because he's bigger, he should get more. But does that make it fair? Also, the author's plan to take the leftovers after she eats her half sounds manipulative. That could be seen as being inconsiderate because he's not respecting her share but letting her eat first so he can get more.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The wife's stance is based on equality, while his is based on his physical needs. However, in a relationship, mutual respect and compromise are important. The author's approach of letting her eat her half first and then taking the rest might be seen as not respecting her agreement. Even if she eats less, he's still taking more than he's supposed to. So, the author's actions, even if his reasoning is based on personal needs, could be seen as unfair. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's planning to make her eat natto instead of leftover pizza the next day adds to the inconsiderate aspect. It seems like he's prioritizing his own preferences without considering her feelings. The wife's insistence on half might be her way of feeling that they are equals, and the author's response undermines that. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions and plans might be seen as inconsiderate and not respecting the agreed-upon split, making him the asshole. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
