My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting a pizza between a husband and wife. The husband wants 60% for himself because he's bigger and eats more, while the wife insists on 50-50.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife allowed him to buy pizza because he found a coupon, and he orders it about four times a year. He also takes her to sushi places the same number of times. So, there's a balance in their indulgences. \n\nThe husband's argument is based on his physical size and appetite. He feels that because he's taller and bigger, he should get more. The wife, on the other hand, wants equality, maybe as a principle of fairness. The key here is whether expecting equal shares is unreasonable when there's a difference in appetite.\n\nAnother point is that the husband plans to take advantage of the wife eating her half first and then taking more of her half. That might be seen as manipulative. Even if he's not the one dividing the pizza, his plan to eat more after she's done could be considered unfair.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, some might say that in a relationship, mutual respect and compromise are important. The wife's insistence on equality might be her way of feeling that her preferences are respected, even if her appetite isn't as big. The husband's approach could be seen as disregarding her feelings, especially if she's not happy with the unequal split.\n\nAlso, the husband's justification based on size and appetite might not account for the fact that they are a couple sharing the meal, and maybe the experience of sharing is important. The wife's desire for half could be about feeling that both their tastes are valued equally, not just about the quantity.\n\nThe husband's plan to make her eat natto the next day if she doesn't finish her half might be a bit harsh. It shows a lack of consideration for her next meal, which could lead to resentment. The fact that he's not feeling bad about it might indicate a lack of empathy.\n\nSo, considering all that, the husband's actions and plans might be seen as inconsiderate and possibly in the wrong. The wife's stance on equality is a valid perspective in a relationship, and the husband's attempt to take more by manipulating the situation could be the issue here. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
