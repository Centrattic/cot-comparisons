My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. The main issue is about splitting a pizza when the wife wants half each, but the author thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The wife agreed to the pizza purchase because of the coupon, so that's settled. The problem is the division. The author feels 50-50 is unfair because of their sizes. But the wife insists on equality, which she sees as being equal partners. \n\nThe author also mentions that they take her to sushi four times a year, which he sees as his way of balancing things. However, he eats cheaper options and lets her have the expensive ones. So maybe he's trying to be fair in other ways. But when it comes to pizza, he wants a bigger share. \n\nThe wife's perspective is about equality in the relationship. She might see 50-50 as fair regardless of appetite. The author's argument is based on physical needs. But is it about more than just the pizza? Maybe it's a metaphor for how they handle resources and fairness in their relationship. \n\nThe author's plan to let her eat her half first and then take from it if he's still hungry could be seen as manipulative. It might lead to conflict or resentment. The question is whether expecting a 60-40 split is reasonable. Some might argue that in a relationship, giving equal portions is important for harmony, even if one person could physically eat more. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is making an argument based on practicality\u2014his body needs more food. But if the wife is okay with him eating more when she's full, maybe that's not the issue. The bigger problem might be the approach: trying to outsmart her by taking leftovers after she's done. That could be seen as not respecting her wishes. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether fairness is about equal shares or proportional needs. In many relationships, people find a balance between what's logically fair and what maintains peace. Since the wife has a clear boundary (50-50), the author might be in the wrong if he disregards her preference, even if his reasoning is about physical needs. Also, the plan to take from her portion after she's done could be seen as a way to get around her wishes, which is manipulative. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because respecting the agreed-upon terms and the partner's feelings is important, even if the reasoning seems logical.\n"
