My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband and wife ordering a pizza. The wife allowed the husband to order pizza with a coupon, but wants half for herself. The husband thinks 60-40 is fair based on their body sizes and consumption, but the wife insists on 50-50. The husband plans to let her eat her half and then take what's left until he's full, even if she doesn't finish hers.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The wife is okay with the pizza order, which is a compromise since she usually doesn't like it. The husband orders a large pizza because he likes eating a lot, not for value. The wife wants half, which is a standard way to split things equally. The husband's reasoning is based on his size and eating more, but the wife argues for equality.\n\nNow, the key points here are about fairness and mutual respect. The husband's plan to take the leftover from her half after she's done is a bit manipulative. Even if he thinks she'll eat less than half, taking what's left after she's done might make her feel like her share is being taken away, which could be seen as disrespectful. The wife's insistence on equal division might be her way of maintaining fairness in the relationship, especially if she values equality. The husband's approach here seems to undermine her request, even though he's allowed to order the pizza in the first place.\n\nAlso, the husband's justification is based on physical size and consumption. While it's true he might eat more, that doesn't necessarily mean it's fair to take more without her consent. The wife's perspective is about equality, and if they are in a partnership, respecting each other's preferences is important. The husband's plan to take what's left after she's eaten shows a lack of consideration for her feelings and the compromise she's already made by allowing him to order pizza. \n\nIn relationships, fairness isn't always about equal shares but about mutual respect and communication. The husband's approach here, while maybe logical from his viewpoint, isn't being respectful of his wife's request. The fact that he's planning to take more without discussing it further suggests he's not willing to find a middle ground, which could lead to resentment. \n\nSo, even though the wife's demand might seem strict, the husband's method of \"taking what's left\" after she eats her half is a bit underhanded. He should have either communicated his preference for a different split or found another solution without undermining her. Therefore, the husband might be in the wrong here.\n"
