My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person in the story is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe person wants to order a pizza because they like it and have a coupon. Their wife allows it, but she insists on splitting it 50-50. The person argues that since they're bigger and eat more, a 60-40 split is fair. The wife keeps saying they should be equal. The person also mentions they take her to sushi 4 times a year, but they order cheaper stuff for themselves. The person plans to let the wife eat her half first and then take the leftovers, even if she's not full. They don't feel bad about it.\n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is the asshole. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the wife allowed the pizza because of the coupon. The author is ordering it for dinner. The author's reasoning is based on their body size and appetite. The wife wants equal parts. The author is okay with letting her eat her half first, then taking the rest. \n\nIn relationships, fairness can be subjective. The author might feel that their needs are justified because of their size, but the wife might see equality as important. The author's plan seems a bit manipulative. If the wife only eats part of her half, the author takes the rest. That could make the wife feel like her share isn't respected. But maybe the author believes it's fair to take the leftovers. \n\nAnother point: the author takes the wife to sushi four times a year, showing consideration. But they order cheaper items for themselves. Maybe the wife doesn't mind that, but it's part of the dynamic. \n\nIs it about respecting the agreed-upon split? The wife allowed the pizza under the condition of splitting it. The author is not following that, instead, trying to take more. Even if they plan to let her eat first, the intention is to take more. The wife might feel disrespected. \n\nAlternatively, the author could have negotiated differently. Maybe the author should have discussed the split beforehand instead of planning to take more. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, splitting something equally is often expected in relationships, even if one person eats more. The author's argument is about physical needs, but maybe the wife's expectation of equality is about fairness in the relationship, not just food. \n\nThe author's actions might be seen as selfish. Even though they take the wife out to sushi, the pizza issue is about a different kind of fairness. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they're not respecting the wife's terms. Even if they think 60-40 is fair, the wife's agreement to the coupon was under the condition of a 50-50 split. The author is going against that, which could be seen as dishonest. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong)."
