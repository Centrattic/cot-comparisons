My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting a pizza between the author and his wife.\n\nFirst, the author ordered a pizza using a coupon with his wife's permission. She agreed to it, so that's settled. The main issue is the 50-50 split. The author thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more. The wife insists on half each, citing equality. The author plans to take more than half after she eats her share, even if she doesn't finish hers, and he doesn't feel bad about it.\n\nHmm. The wife's perspective is about equality, which is a common value in relationships. She might feel that sharing equally is fair, regardless of appetite. The author argues based on physical size and consumption, which he sees as practical. But is that a valid reason to override her expectations?\n\nThe author mentions they both take each other to their preferred restaurants. He takes her to sushi, she might do the same for him? But he orders cheap sushi because it's his taste, while she gets the expensive ones. Maybe she feels that she's already making sacrifices for his preferences, so he should reciprocate in the pizza situation. But he's not doing that, instead trying to take more pizza. \n\nThe key here is mutual respect and compromise. Even if the author thinks 60-40 is fair, he should consider his wife's feelings. Insisting on taking more without her consent might come off as inconsiderate. Also, his plan to take her leftovers after she's done eating seems underhanded. It's not about who's right in the logic, but about how it affects the relationship. The wife might feel disrespected if he's not honoring her agreement. \n\nThe author's approach might be seen as manipulative, using her own terms against her. That could be viewed as the asshole move. So the answer is A.\n"
