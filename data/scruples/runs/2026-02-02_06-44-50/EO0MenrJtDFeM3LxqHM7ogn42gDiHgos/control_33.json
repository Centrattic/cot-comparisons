My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author wants to order a pizza, and his wife says he should only have half. He thinks that's unfair because he's bigger and eats more, so he wants a 60-40 split. The wife keeps insisting on equal halves, even though they both have other things they do for each other.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what the main issue is. The author is arguing based on their physical sizes and eating habits. He's taller and bigger, so he claims he needs more. But the wife argues for equality. Is it fair to split based on size or should it be equal?\n\nI think in many relationships, people split things equally unless there's a specific reason not to. The wife might feel that since they agreed on the pizza, it's a shared expense, so equal sharing is fair. The author is trying to justify taking more because he eats more, but maybe the wife feels that the agreement was about sharing, not about who eats more. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that he takes her to a nice sushi place four times a year, but he orders cheaper items while she has the expensive ones. Maybe the wife sees the pizza as a way to balance things out, or maybe she feels that the sushi outings are her way of indulging, and the pizza should be shared equally. \n\nThe author's plan to let her eat until full from her half and then take the rest seems like he's planning to take advantage. Even if she eats less, taking the remaining half might make her feel cheated, especially if she was promised half. The next day, she can't have leftover pizza, which might be a consequence he's not considering. \n\nI think the main point here is about mutual respect and agreement. If they can't reach a compromise, maybe the author is being a bit selfish, even if he has a reason. The wife's insistence on equality might be about fairness in their relationship, not just the physical amount. So the author might be in the wrong by not respecting her terms for sharing.\n"
