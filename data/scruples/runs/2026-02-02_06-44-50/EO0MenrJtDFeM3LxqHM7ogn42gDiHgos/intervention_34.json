My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting more than half the pizza. The wife gave permission to order with a coupon, but she expects an equal split. The author argues that because he's bigger and eats more, a 60-40 split is fair. They also mention that he takes her to sushi four times a year, but he orders cheaper options while she gets the more expensive ones.\n\nFirst, the wife's argument is about equality\u2014she wants half each. The author thinks physical size and appetite matter, so 60-40 is fair. But in relationships, fairness isn't always about physical needs. It's about mutual respect and compromise. The wife might feel that equal sharing is a way to show they're equals in the relationship, not just in meals. \n\nAlso, the author's plan to take more of her half after she eats her fill could be seen as underhanded. Even if she eats less, he's not directly admitting to taking more but is doing it indirectly. That might hurt her feelings or make her feel her share isn't respected. \n\nThe sushi part adds another angle. He's letting her have the expensive sushi, but he's taking a smaller portion. Maybe she feels the pizza situation isn't as balanced in her favor. However, pizza is a treat he loves, and sushi is a treat she loves. Maybe he's trying to balance giving her something she likes with his own preferences. \n\nBut the core issue is the pizza split. The author's approach is about what he thinks is fair, but fairness can be subjective. The wife's insistence on half might be about feeling equal and included. The author's plan to take advantage of her portion after she's done could be seen as a way to assert his preference without direct negotiation. \n\nIn relationships, these things often come down to communication and compromise. The author might be in the wrong if he's not respecting his wife's feelings of equality, even if he thinks his reasoning is logical. The wife's request is about fairness in their partnership, not just about the food. So the answer might be A (in the wrong) because he's not respecting her perspective on equality and is planning to take more without direct consent.\n"
