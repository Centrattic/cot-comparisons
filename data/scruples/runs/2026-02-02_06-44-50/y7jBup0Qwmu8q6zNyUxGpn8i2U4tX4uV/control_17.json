He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author has a vegan sister who's raising her 10-year-old son as vegan. The nephew comes to the author's house every day for snacks and dinner, and the author makes vegan options for him. But the nephew ends up eating the non-vegan food, like chicken nuggets, even though the author provides vegan snacks. The author didn't tell the sister about this, and the husband thinks the author is at fault for not being honest. The author thinks the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The sister is very strict about her vegan lifestyle, so she might be upset if she found out. The author is respecting the sister's wishes by making vegan meals, but the nephew is choosing to eat the non-vegan food. The question is whether the author should have told the sister or if they're wrong for not doing so.\n\nThe nephew is 10 years old. At that age, he might not fully understand the ethical reasons for being vegan, especially if he's just going along with his friends. The author might feel that it's the nephew's choice, but the sister's beliefs are strong. However, the author is in a position where they are providing food, and the nephew is making his own choices. The author isn't forcing him to eat vegan; they're just offering the option. \n\nBut the sister's expectations might be that the author is ensuring the nephew sticks to a vegan diet when in their care. If the author is aware that the nephew is eating non-vegan food, they might be violating the sister's trust by not informing her. On the other hand, the author could argue that the child's autonomy is important, and that they're not actively encouraging him to eat meat, just allowing him to choose. \n\nThe husband's perspective is that the author is being dishonest by not telling the sister. But the author might feel that it's not their place to police the nephew's choices or to inform the mother. There's a balance between respecting the sister's wishes and respecting the child's autonomy. \n\nLegally, the parent has the right to choose the child's diet, but ethically, the author might be caught in the middle. If the author is intentionally providing non-vegan options, that could be an issue. But in this case, they're providing vegan food, and the child is choosing otherwise. The key is whether the author is enabling the child to make those choices by offering non-vegan options. However, the author is making a separate vegan dish, so the non-vegan food is their own family's meal. The nephew is taking from that. \n\nIf the author is not actively giving him the chicken nuggets, but the nephew is taking them, maybe the author isn't at fault. They are fulfilling their part by providing the vegan options. The choice is the nephew's, even if it's influenced by the availability of non-vegan food. The sister might expect that in the author's care, the vegan diet is strictly followed, but the author is respecting the child's autonomy. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the author is responsible for enforcing the vegan diet or if they're just providing an environment where the child can choose. The author's actions are technically within their rights, but they might be causing a potential conflict with the sister if the truth comes out. However, since the author isn't forcing the child to eat non-vegan food, they might not be in the wrong. The sister's reaction is a possible consequence, but the author's intention is to respect the child's choices. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
