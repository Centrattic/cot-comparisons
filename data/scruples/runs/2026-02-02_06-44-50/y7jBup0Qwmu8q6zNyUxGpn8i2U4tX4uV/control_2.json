He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a vegan nephew who's eating non-vegan food at the author's house. The author's sister is strict about her vegan lifestyle and raises her son that way. The nephew is 10 years old, so the author is making a judgment call about whether to inform the sister.\n\nFirst, the author is providing vegan options but the nephew is choosing the non-vegan ones. The nephew mentions he eats meat sometimes at school, so maybe he's already exposed to it. The author isn't forcing the vegan food; the kid is making his own choices. The author's sister would likely be upset if she knew, given her strong ethical stance. The husband thinks the author is at fault for not telling, but the author believes the nephew is old enough to decide for himself.\n\nNow, considering the sister's perspective, she's raising the child vegan based on her beliefs. If the child is exposed to meat outside the home, it might undermine her efforts. But the child is old enough to make choices, so maybe he's experimenting. The author isn't intentionally feeding him meat; they're providing options. The sister has the responsibility to enforce her dietary rules at home. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't lying but is withholding information. The nephew's choices are his own, and the author is respecting his autonomy. The sister might not have considered that the child could be making his own decisions once he's out of her sight. However, the sister's beliefs are strong, so the author might feel conflicted about keeping this secret. \n\nBut since the author isn't lying and isn't encouraging the child to eat meat, maybe they're not in the wrong. The key points are the child's autonomy and the author's respect for the sister's wishes. The author is providing vegan options, so they're not violating the sister's rules directly. It's a situation where the child is making his own choices in a different environment. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author is allowing the child to make his own choices and isn't forcing meat on him. The sister's reaction would be her responsibility if she finds out, but the author isn't at fault for respecting the child's autonomy and providing options.\n"
