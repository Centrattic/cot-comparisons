He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat without telling their sister. The sister is a strict vegan, and she's raising her son vegan since birth. The nephew is 10 years old now, so he's in a school where he might be exposed to non-vegan food.\n\nFirst, the author is in charge of the nephew after school, providing snacks and dinner. They usually make a vegan dish specifically for him but sometimes the nephew eats the non-vegan food meant for the author's son. The nephew says he eats meat at school sometimes, so he's already been exposed. The author hasn't told the sister, and the husband thinks they're being dishonest. The author believes the nephew is old enough to choose his own diet.\n\nThe key points here are: the sister's ethical stance on veganism, the child's autonomy, and the responsibility of the caregiver. Since the sister is raising her son vegan, she might have strong reasons, like health, ethics, or religion. Allowing the child to eat meat against her wishes could go against her beliefs. The nephew is 10, so while he's a child, his choices are influenced by his guardians. The author is the temporary caregiver, so they have a duty to respect the parents' wishes unless there's a medical reason. The author might be overstepping by not informing the mother, as the sister has the right to know what's happening during her son's care. The nephew's actions could be due to curiosity or peer influence, but the author's role is to follow the parent's guidelines. So, the author might be in the wrong by not communicating with the sister and allowing the child to eat non-vegan food without her knowledge.\n"
