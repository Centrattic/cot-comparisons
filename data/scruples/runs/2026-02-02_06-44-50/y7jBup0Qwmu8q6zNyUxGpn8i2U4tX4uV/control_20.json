He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation is that the author's sister is vegan and raising her son vegan since birth. The nephew usually gets vegan meals at the author's house, but sometimes eats the non-vegan options when the author isn't looking. The author doesn't tell the sister about this because they think the nephew is old enough to make his own choices. The husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not telling, but the author disagrees.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The sister is very strict about veganism, so she might be upset if she finds out her son is eating meat. The nephew is 10, which is a child, so his autonomy might be limited. Even though he's starting to make his own choices, he's still under the care of his parents. The author is providing vegan options, which they did agree with the sister, but the nephew is choosing otherwise. \n\nThe key points here are: the author is respecting the sister's wishes by providing vegan meals, but the nephew is sometimes eating non-vegan food. The author isn't stopping him, which could be seen as enabling his choices, but the sister might view it as undermining her parenting. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author isn't forcing the nephew to eat meat, they're just not intervening when he takes the non-vegan option. The sister might feel that the author is not upholding her dietary beliefs, especially if the nephew is eating meat regularly. However, the nephew is making his own choices, and the author could argue that it's his right to choose, especially since he's in a different environment than his home. \n\nBut since the author is responsible for the nephew during the time he's there, maybe they have a duty to adhere to the parents' wishes. The sister might have entrusted them with her child's vegan diet, and by not enforcing it, the author could be seen as violating that trust. On the other hand, the nephew's autonomy is a factor here. At 10, he's old enough to have preferences, and the author might be trying to respect that. \n\nHowever, the sister's strict veganism is based on ethical beliefs, which the author respects. Telling the sister might cause conflict, but not telling could lead to her discovering it another way, which might be worse. The husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not being honest, which suggests that transparency is important here. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author might be in a dilemma between respecting the nephew's choices and honoring the sister's wishes. But legally and ethically, when a parent has specific dietary requirements for their child, it's usually expected that caregivers follow those guidelines. Since the nephew is in their care, the author might be responsible for ensuring he follows the vegan diet, even if the child chooses otherwise. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whose perspective you take. If the author is not enforcing the vegan diet, even though they provided vegan options, they could be seen as in the wrong because they didn't adhere to the sister's instructions. Alternatively, if the nephew is making his own choices, maybe the author isn't at fault. But considering the sister's strictness and the potential conflict, the author might be in the wrong for not informing her and not preventing the meat consumption.\n"
