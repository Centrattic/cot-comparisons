He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the author feeding their vegan nephew meat, even though the sister is raising him strictly vegan. The nephew is 10 years old, so he's in elementary school. The author provides vegan options but the nephew often chooses the non-vegan food. The husband thinks the author is at fault for not telling the sister, but the author believes the nephew should be allowed to make his own choices.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and legal aspects. The nephew's mother has chosen a vegan diet for him based on her ethical beliefs, which the author respects. But by giving him meat, even if he's the one choosing it, the author is acting against those beliefs. However, the nephew is 10, which is an age where some autonomy is developing, though he's still a child. In some places, children's dietary choices might be influenced by parents, but the author isn't the parent. The legal responsibility for the nephew's diet lies with the mother. The author's role is as a caregiver while the mother isn't present, so perhaps the author is supposed to follow the mother's wishes. But the author isn't forcing the child to eat the meat; the child is making his own choice. \n\nThen there's the relationship aspect. The sister is \"staunchly vegan,\" so she might be very strict. If the author tells her, there could be tension. The author's husband is upset because he thinks it's dishonest. But the author might be trying to respect both the sister's wishes and the nephew's autonomy. \n\nAnother angle: the author is providing vegan options, which shows they are trying to respect the sister's beliefs. However, allowing the nephew to eat non-vegan food could be seen as undermining the sister's parenting choices. The child might not fully understand the ethical reasons behind veganism, so the author's permissiveness could lead to confusion. But on the other hand, the nephew is old enough to make choices, and the author isn't pressuring him, just giving options. \n\nI need to check if there's a right or wrong here. Legally, the author isn't the parent, so they can't make the dietary decisions. But morally, respecting the parent's wishes versus respecting the child's autonomy. The author is in a middle ground, providing both options. However, the sister might expect that while her child is under the author's care, they would follow the prescribed diet. The child's choice to eat meat could be a sign he's questioning it, but the author isn't the one to make that judgment. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong for not informing the sister? Maybe not if they're not lying and are respecting the child's autonomy. But if the sister's wishes are specific that the child shouldn't be exposed to non-vegan food, then the author might be in the wrong. The key is whether the author is supposed to enforce the vegan diet as per the sister's instructions. If the sister knew, would she be upset? The author is aware of the sister's strong stance. \n\nIn the end, the author is providing vegan options, which is good, but allowing the child to choose otherwise could be seen as conflicting with the sister's beliefs. The answer might depend on cultural expectations and the specific agreement between the author and the sister. But since the author isn't the parent and the child is making choices, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, the husband's point about dishonesty if the sister finds out might be valid. The author is withholding information that the sister might consider important. \n\nSo the answer could be B (Not in the wrong) if the author is respecting the child's choices. But if the author is supposed to adhere strictly to the sister's guidelines, then maybe A. I think the main point is that the author isn't forcing the meat but is allowing the child to choose. The sister might not want her child to be given non-vegan options, so the author's inaction might be against the sister's wishes. But the author isn't lying; they're just not reporting. It's a bit of a gray area. I might lean towards B because there's no forced action, but the sister's expectations play a role. However, depending on the context, maybe A is correct. Wait, the question is if the author is in the wrong. If the sister wanted the nephew to be kept strictly vegan during the time he's under the author's care, then the author is in the wrong by providing non-vegan options. But the author is making vegan options available. The problem is the nephew choosing the non-vegan. The author isn't making him, so maybe it's not their fault. But allowing it could be a breach of trust. Hmm. Maybe the answer is B.\n"
