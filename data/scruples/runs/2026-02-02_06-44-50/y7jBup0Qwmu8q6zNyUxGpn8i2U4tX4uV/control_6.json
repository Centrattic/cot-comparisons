He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The sister is vegan and raises her son on a vegan diet. The author provides vegan options but sometimes the nephew eats the non-vegan food, like chicken nuggets. The nephew says he eats meat at school sometimes. The author's husband thinks they're in the wrong for not telling the sister, but the author believes the nephew is old enough to choose.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, unless there's a custody agreement or a court order enforcing the vegan diet, the author isn't breaking any laws. Ethically, it's more nuanced. The sister's choice to raise her child vegan is based on ethical beliefs, so she might see this as a violation. But the nephew is 10, which is a bit of a gray area regarding his autonomy in dietary choices. \n\nIn some places, parents have the right to make healthcare decisions for their children, including diet. If the sister is the legal parent, she's making the dietary choices. However, the nephew is in the author's care during the day, so the author is responsible for his meals during that time. If the author is providing the meals, they have a duty to follow the parents' instructions unless there's a medical reason. \n\nBut the nephew is choosing to eat the non-vegan food, which complicates things. If the author is serving both options, maybe the nephew is making his own choice. However, the author's responsibility might be to enforce the dietary restrictions set by the parents. The husband's argument is about honesty\u2014should they inform the sister about the nephew eating meat?\n\nIf the author didn't ask for permission before serving non-vegan food, they might be overstepping. The sister might have entrusted the author with her child's care, expecting them to adhere to the vegan diet. The nephew's age is a factor; at 10, he's not old enough to make informed decisions about his diet without parental guidance. So the author's inaction in enforcing the vegan diet could be seen as not respecting the sister's wishes, hence being in the wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, the nephew might be experimenting with his food choices, and the author could argue that they're allowing him autonomy. But in most cases, when a parent has specific dietary restrictions for their child, it's the caregiver's responsibility to uphold those unless there's a conflict. The author's decision not to inform the sister could lead to the sister being upset if she finds out, which might strain the family relationships.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't adhere to the sister's dietary instructions for her child, even if the child is choosing non-vegan options. The author's responsibility is to follow the parents' guidelines unless there's a reason to deviate, which they didn't consult about. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
