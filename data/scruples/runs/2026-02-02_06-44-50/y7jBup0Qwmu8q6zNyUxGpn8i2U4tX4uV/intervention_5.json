He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The author's sister is a vegan and raises her son vegan since birth. The nephew sometimes eats meat when he's at their house, even though the author provides vegan options. The sister's husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not telling the sister, but the author believes the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The sister specifically wants her son to be vegan, and the author is allowing him to eat meat. The author argues it's about the nephew's autonomy, but the sister might view it as interfering with her parenting. \n\nLegally, the nephew is a minor, so the parents have authority over their child's diet. The author isn't the parent, but they are responsible for him during the time he's at their house. Ethically, it's about respecting the parents' wishes versus the child's preferences. The author might be violating an agreement made with the sister by not informing her. The sister could see this as a breach of trust or not respecting her beliefs. \n\nAlso, the nephew is 10 years old, so while he might have some autonomy, his parents' views are still the primary decision-makers. The author's actions could contradict the sister's principles. Even if the nephew chooses non-vegan options, the parents' wishes should be considered. The author's husband thinks they're being dishonest by not telling the sister, which adds to the complexity. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to provide vegan options, which shows they respect the sister's wishes. The nephew's eating meat might be because he's curious or influenced by friends. However, the author's continued silence could be seen as not upholding the sister's expectations. \n\nSo, considering the sister's strict veganism and the fact that the nephew is under her care, the author not informing her might be seen as wrong. The parents have the right to set dietary rules, and the author's role is to follow those unless instructed otherwise. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong for not being honest with the sister.\n"
