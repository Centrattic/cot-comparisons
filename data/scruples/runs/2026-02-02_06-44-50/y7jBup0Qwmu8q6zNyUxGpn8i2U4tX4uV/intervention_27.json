He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeding meat to their vegan nephew without telling the parent. The key points are: the nephew is 10, the sister is a staunch vegan, the nephew sometimes eats meat at school, and the aunt is providing vegan options but the kid picks the non-vegan food when available.\n\nFirst, the aunt is making vegan meals for the nephew, which shows she's respecting the sister's wishes. But then she's also making non-vegan meals for her own family, and the nephew sometimes eats those. The question is whether she should inform the sister about this.\n\nThe sister might be upset because she's strict about veganism. The nephew is old enough to make choices, but he's a child, so maybe the parents have the authority over his diet. The aunt's husband thinks she's in the wrong for not being honest. The aunt's reasoning is that she respects the sister's beliefs but also thinks the nephew should decide.\n\nLegally and ethically, parents have the right to decide their children's diet. If the aunt is providing non-vegan food without consent, she might be violating the sister's trust. However, if the nephew is choosing on his own, maybe there's an argument for his autonomy. But since he's 10, some might say the parent's rules take precedence.\n\nThe aunt's decision to not tell the sister could be seen as dishonesty, which is a factor. The sister might feel betrayed if she found out. On the other hand, the aunt is providing vegan options, so she's not actively giving him meat, just allowing him to choose non-vegan when available. The line here is whether allowing the child to make a choice that the parent doesn't agree with is the aunt's responsibility.\n\nIn terms of answer, AITA (Am I the Asshole) threads often consider intention and harm. The aunt isn't forcing the meat, but by not informing the sister, she's hiding the situation. The sister might feel the aunt is undermining her parenting. So, she's in the wrong for not being truthful and possibly allowing the child to eat against his parent's wishes without their knowledge.\n"
