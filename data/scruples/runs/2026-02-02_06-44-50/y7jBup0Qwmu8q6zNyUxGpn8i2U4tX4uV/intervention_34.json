He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat without telling their sister. The situation is that the nephew is raised vegan, but when at the author's house, he sometimes eats the non-vegan food. The author makes vegan options but doesn't stop him if he chooses meat. The sister would be upset if she knew, and the husband thinks the author is at fault for not being honest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, there's probably nothing wrong unless there's a custody agreement or specific rules about the child's diet, which isn't mentioned here. Ethically, it's more complex. The sister is strictly vegan and has ethical beliefs against animal products. The nephew is 10, which is a child, so his dietary choices are typically made by his parents. Even if he's making choices now, the parents' rules should be respected.\n\nThe author is not the parent, so they might be overstepping by allowing the child to eat non-vegan food against the parents' wishes. The author's sister might see this as a breach of trust, especially since she's trusting the author to provide vegan meals. The author's husband thinks they're being dishonest, which adds to the ethical dilemma. However, the nephew might be exploring his preferences, but the parent's wishes are usually prioritized in such cases.\n\nSo, the key points are: the parent's dietary rules, the child's age, and the trust between the author and the sister. The author is in a position where they should follow the parents' instructions unless there's a medical reason, which there isn't here. Therefore, the author is in the wrong by not adhering to the sister's wishes and possibly misleading her about the child's diet.\n"
