He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat without telling their sister. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe sister is a staunch vegan and has been vegan for years, raising her son that way since birth. The nephew is 10, goes to the same school as the author's son, and snacks at the author's house every day. The author usually makes separate meals: a regular one for their family and a vegan one for the nephew. But one day, they found the nephew and son sharing chicken nuggets. The nephew said he sometimes eats meat at school, and the author didn't say anything else, just continued providing vegan options. The husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not telling the sister, but the author thinks the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's perspective. She's raising her son vegan, which is a big commitment. If she found out her son was eating meat without her knowledge, she might be upset because it goes against her ethical beliefs. The author is aware of this and is trying to respect her views.\n\nOn the other hand, the nephew is 10 years old. At that age, kids can start making their own choices, and if he's exposed to meat at school, maybe he's curious. The author isn't forcing him to eat meat; they provide both options, and the nephew chooses the meat. The author isn't encouraging it, just not stopping it. \n\nBut the sister's authority as the parent is important here. Even if the nephew is making choices, the parents are responsible for his diet. By not informing the sister, the author isn't being transparent. The husband's concern is about honesty in the relationship. The author's sister might feel betrayed if she found out the author didn't tell her. \n\nSo, the key points are: the author is respecting the sister's values by providing vegan options but not being honest about the nephew's choices. The sister might see this as a breach of trust, even if the author isn't actively promoting meat. The nephew's autonomy is a factor, but the parents' role in dietary decisions for a child is significant. \n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between respecting the sister's wishes and allowing the child some autonomy. However, since the author is acting as a caregiver (picking up the nephew, providing meals), they have a responsibility to communicate with the parents. Not informing the sister could be seen as undermining her parenting decisions. \n\nI think the answer here is that the author is in the wrong (A) because they are not being truthful with their sister about the nephew's diet, which is a key part of the parenting decisions she made. Even if the nephew is making choices, the parent needs to be informed to maintain trust and consistency in the child's upbringing.\n"
