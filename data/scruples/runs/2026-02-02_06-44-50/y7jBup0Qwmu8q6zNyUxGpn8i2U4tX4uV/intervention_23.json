He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author has a vegan sister who's raising her 10-year-old son as vegan since birth. The nephew and author's son go to the same school, and the author picks them up. They have snacks and dinner at the author's house before the sister picks up the nephew. The author usually makes both a family meal and a vegan one for the nephew. One day, the author left them with homework and snacks, did chores, came back, and found the nephew and son sharing chicken nuggets. The author provides vegan snacks, but the nephew eats the meat. The nephew says he eats meat at school sometimes because friends share. The author didn't tell the sister, thinking the nephew is old enough to choose. The husband thinks the author is dishonest and should have told the sister. The author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's consider the sister's stance. She's been vegan for years and is a staunch vegan, which is an ethical choice. She's raising her son vegan, so she expects him to follow that. The author is providing vegan options but not enforcing the diet, allowing the nephew to choose. But by not informing the sister, the author is keeping a secret. The nephew is 10, so maybe he's starting to make his own choices, but he's still a child, so parents have a role in guiding that. \n\nThe author's husband thinks they're in the wrong for not telling, which suggests a breach of trust. The sister might feel betrayed if she finds out. The author's reasoning is that the nephew is old enough to choose, but the mother's role is to enforce her dietary beliefs. The nephew might be influenced by peers, but the parent's rules are at home. \n\nIs the author responsible for enforcing the vegan diet? The author isn't the parent, but they're in a position of care. By providing non-vegan options and allowing the nephew to eat them, maybe against the parent's wishes, the author is not following the parent's instructions. Even if the nephew is choosing, the author should have informed the sister. \n\nThe sister might argue that the author isn't respecting her parenting decisions. The author's actions could undermine the sister's efforts. The nephew might be confused if he's allowed to eat meat at his aunt's but not at home. The author's decision to stay silent could be seen as complicit in the child not adhering to the parent's rules. \n\nOn the other hand, the nephew is 10 and might be exploring his own preferences. But the parent has the authority to set the dietary rules. The author's role is to follow the parent's guidelines. If the parent expects the child to be vegan, the author should enforce that. Not informing the sister is a breach of trust because the parent might not be aware of the child's choices. \n\nSo, the key points are: the author is not following the parent's dietary instructions, allowing the child to eat non-vegan food, and keeping it a secret. The parent might have a right to know to address the situation. Therefore, the author is in the wrong by not informing the sister, even if they respect her beliefs. The decision to not tell the sister is dishonest and could lead to the parent being upset later. \n\nAnswer A.\n"
