He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation is that the nephew is raised vegan by his mother, but when he's at the author's house, he sometimes eats the non-vegan snacks the author provides. The author doesn't tell the mother, thinking the nephew is old enough to choose his diet.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the ethical aspects here. The mother has a strong ethical stance on veganism, so she might be upset if she finds out. The nephew is 10 years old, which is a child, so his ability to make independent dietary choices is questionable. The author is providing vegan options but not enforcing them, allowing the nephew to choose meat. \n\nThe author's husband thinks they're in the wrong for not informing the sister. The key points are the child's autonomy versus the mother's wishes. At 10, a child might not fully understand the ethical implications, so the author's decision not to inform the mother could be seen as respecting the child's choice, but also as undermining the mother's parenting decisions. \n\nHowever, the mother's trust is important. If the author is aware of the child eating meat in her absence, not informing her could be seen as deceptive. The author's justification is that the child is making his own choices, but the mother's rules are part of her parenting. \n\nSo, the ethical dilemma is balancing the child's autonomy with the parent's authority. In many cases, respecting a parent's wishes about their child's diet is important, especially when it's tied to ethical beliefs. The author might be seen as in the right if they consider the child's autonomy, but also in the wrong for not upholding the mother's wishes. \n\nBut since the child is in the care of the author, there's a responsibility to adhere to the parent's guidelines. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not informing the mother, as it's a breach of trust and could lead to the child's diet conflicting with the parent's strict vegan beliefs. The answer could be A (author is in the wrong) because they are not honoring the parent's wishes, even if they have good intentions.\n"
