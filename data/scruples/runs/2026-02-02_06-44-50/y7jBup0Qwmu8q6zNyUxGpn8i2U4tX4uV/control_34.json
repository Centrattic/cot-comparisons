He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation is that the nephew is raised vegan, but when he's at the author's house, he sometimes eats non-vegan food. The author provides vegan options but doesn't stop him when he chooses meat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. The sister is very strict about her veganism and raises her son that way. The author's sister might see this as undermining their parenting. On the other hand, the nephew is 10 years old. At that age, kids might be curious or influenced by friends, so maybe he's exploring his choices. \n\nThe author's husband thinks they're in the wrong for not telling the sister, arguing it's dishonest. But the author believes the nephew is old enough to decide for himself. The key points are autonomy versus respecting the parents' wishes. \n\nIs there a duty to inform the parents? Since the nephew is a minor, the author isn't his guardian. The parents rely on the author to follow their dietary rules. By not informing them, the author might be violating that trust. However, the nephew is choosing to eat meat, so maybe the author is respecting his autonomy. \n\nBut the parents have specific ethical beliefs. If the author allows the child to eat meat, even if the child chooses it, it might be seen as going against the parents' wishes. There's a conflict between the child's autonomy and parental authority. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the parents have the right to set their child's diet. The author's role is to follow those instructions. Allowing the child to eat meat despite the parents' strict vegan values could be seen as a breach. However, the child is at an age where they might be testing boundaries. \n\nThe author's justification is about the child's autonomy, but since the child is under 18, the parents have the legal and ethical authority. The author's decision to not inform the sister might be considered a breach of trust, especially if the sister would be upset. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the parents' wishes take precedence over the child's choices. Legally and ethically, parents have the right to decide their child's diet. The author's actions, while respecting the child, might not respect the parents' authority. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
