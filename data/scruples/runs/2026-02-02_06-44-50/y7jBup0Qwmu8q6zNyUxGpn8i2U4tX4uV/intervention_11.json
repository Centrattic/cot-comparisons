He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a vegan sister and her vegan son. The author, the sister's sibling, is feeding the nephew non-vegan food despite the mother's wishes. The nephew is 10 years old.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the mother's perspective. She's been vegan for years and raising her son vegan since birth. She might have specific ethical reasons for this choice, like animal rights or health. The author is providing non-vegan food, which the mother would likely disapprove of. The sister might feel that the author is undermining her parenting choices and beliefs. \n\nThen there's the nephew's autonomy. At 10, he's a kid, and while he might have some curiosity about meat, his mother's rules are in place for a reason. The author is allowing the child to make choices that the parent doesn't agree with. This could lead to confusion for the child about what's acceptable. Also, if the mother finds out, she might feel betrayed or think the author isn't respecting her values. \n\nThe author's husband thinks they're in the wrong for not telling the sister, which adds another layer. The sister's trust is important here. By not informing her, the author is keeping a secret that directly affects her parenting decisions. \n\nOn the other hand, the nephew is at his uncle's house, and maybe he's just trying to fit in with friends. But the uncle is the one providing the non-vegan food, which is a deliberate choice. Even if the nephew eats the non-vegan food on his own, the uncle is enabling that by not stopping it or informing the parents. \n\nSo, the key points are: respecting the parent's wishes, the child's autonomy vs. parental authority, and the potential ethical implications of the author's actions. The author is in a position where they're making decisions that the parent hasn't agreed to. Even if they think the child should have autonomy, the parent's rules are part of the child's upbringing. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they're not honoring the mother's request to keep the child vegan. By providing non-vegan options and not informing the sister, they're acting against her beliefs and possibly harming her parenting efforts. The child's autonomy isn't the main issue here since the parent's authority is still valid. Also, the author's husband's perspective supports the idea that honesty is important in this situation.\n"
