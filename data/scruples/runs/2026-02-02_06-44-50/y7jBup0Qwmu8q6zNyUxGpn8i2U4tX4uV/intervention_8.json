He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for feeding their nephew meat when the parents are vegan. The situation is that the sister raises her son vegan, but the nephew is eating meat when at the author's house. The author provides vegan options, but the child chooses the non-vegan food. The sister's husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not telling her, but the author thinks the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' wishes. The sister is strict about her vegan lifestyle, so allowing the child to eat meat could conflict with their values. The parents might have specific reasons for the vegan diet, maybe health, ethical, or religious. The author's role here is as a temporary caregiver when picking up the kids. \n\nThe key points are: the nephew is at the author's house, the author provides vegan meals, but the child eats the meat. The author hasn't told the sister, which the husband is upset about. The nephew is 10, so maybe old enough to make choices, but the parents are responsible for his diet. \n\nIs the author respecting the parents' wishes by not informing them? If the parents wanted the child to strictly follow a vegan diet even when not at home, then the author might be violating that by not telling. But if the child is making independent choices, maybe the author is doing the right thing by not interfering. However, the parents might not want their child to be exposed to meat, even if he's choosing it himself. \n\nAlso, the author is responsible for the child's care during pickup, so they might have a duty to comply with the parents' instructions. By not informing the sister, the author could be seen as withholding important information that affects the child's upbringing. \n\nBut the nephew is eating the meat himself, so it's his choice. However, the parents might have rules at home, and the author's house is a different environment. The author might be providing a safe space for the child to explore different options, which is a gray area. \n\nIn terms of the author's responsibility, if they're acting as a caregiver, they should adhere to the parents' guidelines. The husband's concern is about honesty, which is valid because the parents might be upset if they find out through someone else. The author's decision to not tell the sister could breach trust, even if the author's intentions are good. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they're not following the parents' explicit instructions and not communicating a significant issue. However, the child's autonomy is a counterpoint. But parents typically have the final say in their child's diet. Therefore, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong for not informing the sister and allowing the child to eat meat against the parents' wishes.\n"
