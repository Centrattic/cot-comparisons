He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The context is that the nephew is being raised vegan by his mom, but when he's at the author's house, he sometimes eats non-vegan food.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The sister is strict about her vegan beliefs, and she's raising her son that way. The author is making vegan meals for the nephew but allows him to eat the non-vegan options when he chooses. The nephew is 10 years old, so the author argues he's old enough to make his own choices. However, the sister might be upset if she finds out because it goes against her ethical beliefs.\n\nOn one hand, the author is respecting the nephew's autonomy by not intervening when he chooses to eat meat. They're providing vegan options as per the mom's wishes, but not forcing it on him. On the other hand, the sister might see this as undermining her parenting decisions. The husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not telling the sister and being dishonest. But the author's reasoning is about respecting the child's choice.\n\nI should also consider cultural or societal norms. In some cultures, parents have strict dietary rules, and others might see it as their role to enforce those. However, the nephew is in a situation where he's exposed to different options. The key points are consent, autonomy, and respect for the parent's wishes.\n\nIs the author violating the trust of the sister by not informing her? The author chose not to tell the sister, which the husband sees as dishonesty. But the author's intention is to avoid conflict and let the child decide. There's a balance between respecting the parent's wishes and the child's autonomy.\n\nIn terms of ethics, if the sister explicitly asked for the child to be kept vegan, then the author might be in the wrong for not adhering. But if the sister didn't specify that the nephew shouldn't be exposed to meat at all when not under her care, then the author might not be in the wrong. The sister's rules apply when the child is with her, but when he's at the author's house, maybe the rules are different.\n\nAnother angle: The nephew is eating meat when given the chance, possibly influenced by his friends. The author isn't forcing him to eat meat, just not stopping him. The sister's reaction could be based on the belief that exposing the child to meat is harmful, but the author is providing the vegan option as requested.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the sister trusted the author to provide vegan meals and not expose the child to meat, then the author is violating that trust. But if the sister never specified that the child shouldn't eat non-vegan food at all when away from her, then the author isn't necessarily wrong. The author's choice to not tell the sister might be seen as dishonest, but their reasoning is about the child's autonomy.\n\nI think the answer could be B (Not in the wrong) because the author is providing the vegan options as per the sister's request and not forcing the meat on the nephew. However, there's an argument that they should have informed the sister. But since the sister didn't specify that the nephew shouldn't eat meat at all when not with her, the author's actions might be justified. The key is whether the sister's trust was broken by not informing her, but since the author wasn't hiding the meals, just allowing the child to choose, it's a bit different. So, B makes sense here.\n"
