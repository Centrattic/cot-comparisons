He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a 10-year-old nephew who's been raised vegan, but when he's at his uncle's house, he ends up eating meat. The uncle provides vegan snacks but doesn't stop the kid when he chooses non-vegan options.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. The sister is staunchly vegan and raised her son that way. She might be upset if she found out he's eating meat elsewhere. The uncle's husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not informing the sister. But the uncle argues the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nNow, the key points here: The nephew is 10, so a child. The uncle is providing vegan options as requested by the sister. However, the nephew is choosing to eat the non-vegan food. The uncle didn't force him; he just didn't stop him. The sister might see this as going against her parenting choices. But the uncle might be respecting the child's autonomy, allowing him to explore different foods, which could be a normal part of growing up.\n\nBut there's a potential conflict here between respecting the parents' wishes and allowing the child some independence. The uncle is in a position of responsibility when the nephew is under his care. Even though he's providing vegan options, if the child is consistently choosing non-vegan foods, maybe the uncle should have a conversation with the sister. However, the uncle might believe that the child should have some freedom to choose, especially since he's in a different environment.\n\nAnother angle: The nephew is old enough to understand the difference between vegan and non-vegan. If he's choosing meat, maybe he's curious or influenced by friends. The uncle's decision not to inform the sister could be seen as protecting the child or respecting his autonomy. But from the sister's viewpoint, it's a breach of trust because she's relying on the uncle to maintain the vegan diet.\n\nEthically, it's a dilemma between respecting parental authority and allowing the child to explore. The uncle might not be in the wrong, but there's a responsibility to communicate if there's a concern about the child's diet. However, since the nephew is making the choice himself, maybe the uncle isn't directly at fault. The sister's reaction is a separate issue, but the uncle's role is to follow the parents' instructions unless there's a valid reason not to.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer depends on whether the uncle is obligated to enforce the vegan diet strictly or if allowing the child to choose is acceptable. If the uncle was instructed to keep the meals vegan, then deviating without informing the parent could be seen as wrong. But if the uncle is providing the options and the child chooses differently, it's more about the child's autonomy. The uncle might not be in the wrong, but there's a case for both sides. The sister's strict vegan principles versus the uncle's respect for the child's choices.\n\nHmm, I think the key is whether the uncle is respecting the parents' wishes. Since the sister is raising the child vegan, the uncle's role when caring for him should align with those wishes. If the uncle is providing vegan options but the child is choosing otherwise, maybe the uncle is not enforcing the diet as requested. So, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't prevent the child from eating non-vegan food when they were responsible for his care. Alternatively, the uncle could argue that the child's autonomy should be respected. But given the sister's strong stance, the uncle's actions might be seen as undermining her parenting. So, the answer might be A (wrong) because he's not following the parent's instructions. But maybe B (not wrong) because the child is making his own choices. I need to decide which takes precedence.\n"
