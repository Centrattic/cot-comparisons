He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author has a vegan sister who raises her son vegan since birth. The nephew is 10 years old, and the author's son is in the same school. The author picks up both kids every day, and the nephew has snacks and dinner at their house until his mom picks him up. The author makes separate meals for their family and the nephew. But one day, the nephew and the author's son are sharing chicken nuggets. The author provided vegan snacks, but the nephew ate the non-vegan ones. The nephew says he sometimes eats meat at school when friends share. The author didn't tell the sister, and the husband thinks the author is in the wrong by not telling her, while the author thinks the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the sister is strict about veganism, the nephew is 10, the author is providing vegan options but the kid is choosing meat, and the author is hiding this from the sister. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, the sister's beliefs are important. She's raising her son vegan, so she's probably making a conscious choice based on ethical, health, or environmental reasons. If the author is giving the nephew meat without her knowledge, that could undermine her parenting decisions. The sister might feel that her child's diet is being compromised, especially since he's only getting vegan food at home. But the nephew is 10, so he's starting to have more autonomy. However, kids at that age might not fully understand the reasons behind veganism, so maybe the author is trying to respect the child's choices. On the other hand, the parent (the sister) has the right to know what her child is eating when they're not at home. The author is withholding information that could be important for the sister. The husband's argument is that the author is being dishonest by not telling the sister. The author's reasoning is that the nephew is old enough to choose, but the sister might not approve of the meat consumption. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the sister is the parent, so she has a right to know what her child is being exposed to during his time away from home. The author is making decisions that affect the child's diet without consulting the parent. Even if the author provides vegan options, the fact that the child is choosing non-vegan options could be something the sister needs to address. The author might be overstepping by allowing the child to eat meat, especially if the sister's strict veganism is about ethical beliefs. The author could be seen as undermining the sister's parenting by not informing her. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because they are not being transparent with the parent about their child's diet during visits. But then again, the nephew is 10 and might be making his own choices, but the parent's beliefs are important. There's a balance between respecting the child's autonomy and the parent's wishes. However, since the parent is the one making the dietary choices for the child, the author's failure to communicate could be a breach of trust. So I think AITA would say the author is in the wrong for not telling the sister.\n"
