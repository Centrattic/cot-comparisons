He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation is that the sister is raising her son vegan since birth, and the author, who cares for him after school, provides both vegan and non-vegan options. The nephew sometimes eats the meat, and the author hasn't told the sister yet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's perspective. She's vegan and has ethical reasons for raising her son that way. If she knew her son was eating meat, she might be upset or worried about his health or her values. The author is in a position where they're making choices that might go against the parent's wishes, even if they're providing vegan options.\n\nOn the other hand, the nephew is 10 years old. At that age, some might argue he's old enough to make his own choices, especially regarding his diet. The author might be giving him a chance to decide, which could be seen as fostering autonomy. However, the parents have the final say in their child's upbringing. The author is acting as a caregiver but isn't the parent. There's a responsibility to inform the parents about any deviations from the agreed-upon dietary rules, especially since the parents might have specific ethical or health reasons for the vegan diet.\n\nThe husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not telling the sister and being dishonest. That's a point to consider. Even if the author isn't malicious, withholding information that the parents might consider important could be seen as a breach of trust. The parents might want to be aware of their child's eating habits, especially if they're strict about it. The author's decision to let the nephew choose could conflict with the parents' wishes, regardless of the child's age.\n\nBut then again, maybe the parents didn't specify that the author should prevent the nephew from eating non-vegan food. The author is providing both options, which might be within the boundaries of their role. However, if the parents are relying on the author to maintain a vegan diet, then allowing the child to eat meat could be a problem. The key here is whether the author overstepped by not discussing it with the sister.\n\nAnother angle is the potential health implications. A vegan diet for a child needs to be carefully balanced, and introducing meat might affect that. The sister might be concerned about nutritional balance or ethical reasons. The author might not be aware of these nuances, but if they knew, they'd have a duty to inform.\n\nSo, the main factors are: the parents' expectations vs. the author's actions, the child's autonomy, and the ethical implications. The author might be in the right if they believe the parents didn't specify strict vegan enforcement, but if the parents expected strict adherence, then the author is in the wrong by not informing them. Since the sister is \"staunchly vegan,\" it's likely she would expect the author to maintain that diet when caring for her child. Therefore, the author's decision to let the nephew choose could be a breach of trust, making them in the wrong.\n"
