He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat.\n\nFirst, the sister has been vegan for years and is raising her son vegan since birth. The nephew is 10 and attends the same school as the author's son. The author provides vegan snacks and meals for the nephew each day. However, the nephew sometimes eats the non-vegan food (like chicken nuggets) that the author's son eats. The nephew mentions he eats meat at school sometimes because friends share. The author hasn't told the sister, and the husband thinks they're in the wrong for not being honest. The author argues the nephew is old enough to choose his own diet.\n\nSo, key points: The sister's beliefs are strict veganism, which the author respects. The nephew is eating meat when given the chance, perhaps out of curiosity or peer influence. The author is not actively encouraging him to eat meat, but isn't stopping him either. The dilemma is whether the author is in the wrong by not informing the sister about this.\n\nLegally and ethically, the author isn't forcing the nephew to eat meat. The sister is the one making dietary choices for her child. If the nephew is making his own choices now, the author might feel it's his right to choose. However, the sister might see this as undermining her parenting decisions. The author is in a middle ground, respecting the nephew's autonomy while still providing the vegan options. The husband's perspective is about honesty, but the author is protecting the nephew's choice.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a matter of perspective. The author isn't violating the sister's rules directly by not feeding meat, but by allowing the nephew to choose non-vegan options. However, the sister's strict stance on veganism might consider this a breach of trust. But the nephew's autonomy is also a factor. So, the answer depends on whether respecting the child's choices overrides respecting the parent's rules.\n"
