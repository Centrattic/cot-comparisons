He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent who's vegan and raising her son vegan since birth. The author is the aunt, who's responsible for the nephew after school. The aunt usually makes separate vegan meals, but the nephew ends up eating non-vegan food like chicken nuggets. The nephew says he eats meat sometimes at school, and the aunt doesn't correct him or report this to the mother. The husband thinks she's being dishonest by not telling the sister, while the aunt believes the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical perspectives here. The sister is strict about her veganism for ethical reasons. The nephew is 10, so maybe he's starting to understand his own choices, but he's still a child. The aunt is providing vegan options but allowing him to choose non-vegan when available. Is that okay?\n\nThe key points are: the sister's beliefs vs. the nephew's autonomy. The aunt isn't forcing the vegan food; she's offering it. The nephew is making his own choice to eat the non-vegan food, which might be due to peer influence. But the sister might see this as a breach of trust because she's raising her child vegan. \n\nIs the aunt being dishonest if she doesn't inform the sister? The aunt might think it's respecting the nephew's autonomy, but the sister could feel that the aunt isn't respecting her parenting choices. The aunt's husband argues she's being dishonest, but the aunt thinks the nephew can decide for himself. \n\nI need to decide if the aunt is in the wrong. If the sister's instructions were clear that the nephew should only eat vegan when with the aunt, then the aunt might be violating that. However, the nephew is choosing on his own, which complicates things. The aunt isn't forcing him to eat meat, just allowing his choices. But if the sister's rules are that when the nephew is in their care, he must stick to vegan, then the aunt is perhaps not following those rules. \n\nOn the other hand, the nephew might be experimenting, and the aunt's approach could be seen as supporting his autonomy. However, the sister's ethical stance is about not consuming animal products for ethical reasons. The aunt's actions might be undermining that. \n\nI think the aunt's intentions are good, but by not informing the sister, she's not being transparent. The sister's beliefs are important, and the aunt might be in the wrong by not respecting her wishes. So, answer A.\n"
