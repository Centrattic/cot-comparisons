He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) story is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent who is vegan and raising her son vegan, while her sister (the one asking the question) gives her nephew non-vegan food when he's at her house.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The sister has been vegan for years and her son is vegan since birth. The nephew is at their house every day for snacks and dinner before his mom picks him up. The sister usually provides vegan meals but sometimes the nephew eats non-vegan food, like chicken nuggets. The sister finds out once and the nephew says he eats meat sometimes at school. She decides not to tell her sister, even though her husband thinks she's wrong. The sister believes the nephew is old enough to make his own choices, but the mom would be upset if she knew.\n\nSo the main question is whether the sister is in the wrong by giving the nephew non-vegan food without telling the mom. The sister is respecting the mom's beliefs but allowing the child to choose, while the husband thinks it's dishonest. The nephew is 10 years old, which is in the pre-teen age, so maybe he's starting to make his own choices.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. The mom's choice to raise her son vegan is a valid ethical stance, and the sister is not enforcing that. But the sister is also providing vegan options, so she's not forcing the child to eat meat. The child is making his own choices, which the sister is respecting. However, the sister is not informing the mom, which could be seen as dishonesty. The sister's reasoning is that the child is old enough to decide, but the mom might feel betrayed if she found out.\n\nFrom the sister's perspective, she's trying to be respectful of the mom's beliefs but also allowing the child some autonomy. From the mom's perspective, she might expect the sister to uphold the vegan lifestyle while her son is under her care. The sister isn't providing non-vegan food intentionally, but the fact that she allows the child to choose could conflict with the mom's wishes.\n\nThe key factors here are: respect for the parent's wishes, the child's autonomy, and honesty in the relationship. If the sister knew the mom would be upset, not telling her could be seen as a breach of trust, even if it's out of respect for the child. On the other hand, the sister is not forcing the child to eat meat and is providing vegan options. The dilemma is between respecting the parent's values and respecting the child's choices.\n\nIn some cultures or relationships, it's expected to report any deviation from the parent's rules. In others, it's seen as the parent's responsibility to enforce their own rules. Since the sister is the one providing food, she might be in a position where she's expected to follow the parent's guidelines unless given permission otherwise.\n\nThe answer might depend on whether the sister had a prior agreement with the mom about the child's diet during visits. If there was no such agreement, the sister's actions could be seen as going against the parent's wishes, making her the asshole. However, if the sister had some flexibility (like the child sometimes getting meat at school), it's more complicated.\n\nGiven that the nephew is 10, the sister might believe it's appropriate for him to have some autonomy, but the parent's strict vegan stance might not allow for that. The sister's decision not to inform the parent could be seen as a lack of honesty, which is a key point in the AITA question.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the sister might be in the wrong (A) because she's not being honest with her sister about the child's diet, even if her intention is to respect the child's choice. The parent has a right to know how her child is being cared for, especially regarding such a strict ethical stance. Alternatively, if the sister had discussed it and the parent was okay with some flexibility, it's different, but she didn't. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
