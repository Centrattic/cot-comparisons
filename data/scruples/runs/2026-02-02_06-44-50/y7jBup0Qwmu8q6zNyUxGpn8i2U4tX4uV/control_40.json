He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation is that the nephew is being raised vegan by his mother, but when he's at the author's house, he's being given both vegan and non-vegan options. The nephew sometimes chooses the non-vegan food, and the author isn't telling his mother about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects here. The mother is very strict about the vegan diet for ethical reasons, which the author respects. The nephew is 10 years old, which is a kid, so the question is about whether he can truly make his own dietary choices. At that age, he might not fully understand the reasons behind the vegan diet his mother enforces. He might just be curious or influenced by his friends at school.\n\nThe author is providing both options, which could be seen as giving the nephew a chance to decide for himself. However, the mother's trust in the author might be breached if the author isn't transparent about this. The husband's perspective is that the author is being dishonest by not informing the mother, which adds a layer of family dynamics here. The author's reasoning is that the nephew is old enough to choose, but legally and developmentally, a 10-year-old is still a child, and major dietary choices are typically made by guardians.\n\nAnother angle is the potential harm. If the nephew is eating meat that's against his mother's beliefs, is there any harm? The mother might be upset, and the child might be confused about his dietary guidelines. Also, if the child is getting used to eating meat in the author's house, it might conflict with what he's supposed to be learning about veganism at home.\n\nThe key points here are: the age of the child, the mother's strict adherence to veganism, the author's role as a caregiver in their home, and whether transparency is necessary. The author is technically not feeding the nephew meat against his mother's wishes, but by not informing her, they might be keeping a secret that the mother has a right to know about, especially if it's about her child's diet.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the mother is the guardian, she has the legal authority to make dietary decisions for her son. The author's actions could be seen as undermining the mother's wishes, even if they respect her beliefs. However, if the author is providing the non-vegan food without actively encouraging it, and the child is choosing it, the line is a bit blurry. But the main issue is non-disclosure. The mother might appreciate knowing that her child is occasionally eating meat elsewhere, to address any misunderstandings or reinforce the vegan diet.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong for not being transparent with the mother about the situation, even if the choice to eat meat is the child's. The mother has the right to know about her child's diet when they are in someone else's care.\n"
