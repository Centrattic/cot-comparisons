He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the sister is vegan and has been raising her son as vegan since birth. The nephew is 10 years old, and the author provides vegan snacks and dinner for him. However, the nephew sometimes eats the non-vegan options (like chicken nuggets) that the author's son eats. The nephew says he eats meat at school sometimes when friends share. The author hasn't told the sister, and the husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not being honest, while the author believes the nephew is old enough to choose his own diet.\n\nSo, the key points here are the sister's strict vegan ethics, the nephew's age, the author's provision of vegan options, and the nephew's choices. The sister's beliefs are important here\u2014she wouldn't want her son eating meat. The author is in a position of responsibility for the nephew during school pick-up times. Even though the nephew is 10, children that age might not fully understand the ethical implications or the importance of adhering strictly to veganism. The sister might see the author as complicit in her child eating non-vegan food, which goes against their household's values. The author is providing the meat, which the nephew accesses, so there's a question of whether that's a breach of the sister's wishes. On the other hand, the nephew is making his own choices, but since he's a minor, the author might have a duty to respect the parents' dietary decisions. The ethical dilemma here hinges on respecting the parents' beliefs versus allowing the child autonomy. Since the child is under 18, parents typically make those decisions. The author might be seen as going against the sister's wishes by not preventing the nephew from eating meat, even if it's the nephew's choice. Therefore, the author could be considered in the wrong for not honoring the sister's parenting decisions regarding her child's diet.\n"
