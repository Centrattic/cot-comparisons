He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong (AITA). The scenario involves the author feeding their vegan nephew meat without telling their sister. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister is a staunch vegan and raising her son that way. The nephew is 10, so maybe old enough to make choices, but still a child. The author provides vegan options but doesn't stop him from eating the non-vegan food when he chooses it. The husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not telling the sister, while the author believes the nephew can choose his own diet.\n\nI should consider the ethics here. The sister's beliefs are important. If the nephew is eating meat, it's against her values. But the nephew is old enough to decide? However, children's dietary choices are usually managed by parents, especially for ethical or health reasons. The author is in a position where they're not the parent, but they are providing meals. \n\nIs the author acting against the parent's wishes? The sister is raising her son vegan, so the author's actions might interfere with that. But the nephew is at the author's house, and maybe the author isn't the parent. However, intentionally providing non-vegan options could be seen as undermining the parent's decisions. \n\nAlso, the nephew is in a school setting where friends share meals. But the author's home is a different environment. The author's husband feels dishonesty is involved, but the author isn't stopping the nephew from eating non-vegan food. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? Maybe because they're not respecting the sister's parenting choices. Even if the nephew can choose, the parent's wishes should be considered. The author could have a duty to inform the sister to avoid conflict. Alternatively, the nephew's autonomy is a factor. But since he's a child, parents typically make decisions for them. \n\nThe answer might depend on cultural or family dynamics. If the sister's rules are about her child's diet, the author is violating that by not enforcing it. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by not informing her and allowing the child to eat meat despite knowing the parent's stance.\n"
