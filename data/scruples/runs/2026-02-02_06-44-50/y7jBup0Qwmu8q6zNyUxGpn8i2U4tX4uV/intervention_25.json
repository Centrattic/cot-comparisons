He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving their vegan nephew meat. The situation involves a 10-year-old boy who's been raised vegan since birth, but when at his uncle's house, he eats the non-vegan snacks provided. The uncle isn't stopping him, even though he knows the mother would be upset if she found out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' rights. The mother is raising her child vegan, which is a significant decision based on her ethical beliefs. Trust is a big part of parenting. If the child is eating meat elsewhere without the parents' knowledge, that could be seen as a breach of trust. The uncle is aware of the dietary restrictions but isn't enforcing them. Is that respecting the parents' wishes or overstepping?\n\nThe nephew is 10, so maybe he's old enough to make choices, but he's still a minor. Parents are the ones making decisions for their child until they're adults. The uncle might think the child should have autonomy, but legally and morally, the parents are the ones who decide. Even if the uncle is providing vegan options, the fact that he's allowing the child to eat meat without informing the mother could be an issue. \n\nAlso, the mother might have medical or ethical reasons for the diet. If she's not informed, she can't monitor his health or address any potential issues. The uncle's husband thinks they're being dishonest, which adds another layer. The uncle might be trying to be lenient, but is that justifying a lack of communication? \n\nThere's a balance here between respecting the parents' wishes and allowing the child some freedom. But the key point is that the mother hasn't given permission for the child to eat meat elsewhere. The uncle's actions could undermine the parents' parenting choices. Even if the nephew is choosing to eat meat, the uncle isn't honoring the parents' decision, which could be seen as interference. \n\nSo, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because they're not respecting the parents' dietary decisions for their child. Even if the child is making choices, the parents' authority is paramount. The uncle isn't informing the mother, which is a form of dishonesty. Therefore, the uncle should inform the mother or at least not facilitate the child eating meat against her wishes.\n"
