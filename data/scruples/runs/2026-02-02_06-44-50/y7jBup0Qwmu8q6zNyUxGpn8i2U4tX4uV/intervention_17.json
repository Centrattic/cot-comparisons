He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation involves a 10-year-old child who's been vegan since birth, according to his mom. The author provides vegan options but the nephew sometimes eats the non-vegan food, which the author doesn't stop. The husband thinks they're in the wrong for not telling the sister, while the author believes the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nFirst, legal aspects probably don't apply here. The main ethical dilemma is about respecting parental decisions versus a child's autonomy. The sister is raising the child vegan for ethical reasons, and the author is allowing him to eat meat when not at home. The key points here are the child's age and the parents' wishes.\n\nAt 10 years old, the nephew is a minor, and in most ethical frameworks, children aren't considered capable of making significant life choices like dietary restrictions. Parents typically have the authority to make such decisions for their children. The author's sister is making a deliberate choice based on her ethical beliefs, so the author might be undermining that by not enforcing the vegan diet when in their care.\n\nThe author argues the nephew is old enough to choose, but if the parents have established a vegan household, others might be expected to respect that. The author could be seen as enabling the child to make choices that the parents have explicitly forbidden. Even if the nephew shares with friends at school, the author's home is under their control, and they should adhere to the parents' wishes unless there's a medical reason.\n\nThere's also the aspect of honesty. The author isn't informing the sister, which could cause a breach of trust if discovered. The husband's concern about dishonesty is valid. The author might be in the wrong for not communicating openly with the sister, especially since the sister's values are important here.\n\nHowever, there's a counter-argument that the nephew is exploring his preferences, which is part of growing up. But given the parents' firm stance, the author should have discussed this with the sister before allowing deviations. The line between respecting a child's autonomy and respecting parental authority is crucial here. Since the parents are the primary caregivers, their dietary rules should be upheld in their child's care.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author likely is in the wrong for not respecting the sister's wishes and for not being transparent. The answer is A.\n"
