He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation involves the nephew being raised vegan by his mother, but when he's at the author's house, he sometimes eats non-vegan food.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the nephew. He's 10 years old, so he's a child. Even though he's old enough to understand some dietary choices, the legal age of majority isn't reached yet. Parents are typically responsible for their children's diet, especially when it comes to ethical or health-related choices. The mother has specifically requested a vegan diet for her son, so the author's sister has made that a priority.\n\nThe author provides vegan options but doesn't stop the nephew when he chooses the meat. They also know the sister would be upset if she found out. The husband thinks the author is at fault for not being honest and possibly lying. But the author argues the nephew is old enough to make his own choices. However, as a guardian or caregiver, the author might have a responsibility to inform the parents about the child's diet, especially if it goes against their wishes.\n\nEthically, the sister's beliefs are about animal ethics, so the author's actions might be seen as undermining those beliefs. While the nephew might be influenced by friends at school, the author's house is under their control. The parents have the right to know what their child is consuming, especially if it's against their parenting decisions. The author's decision not to inform the sister could be seen as a breach of trust or ignoring the parents' wishes.\n\nOn the other hand, the nephew might be exploring his own preferences, and the author might want to respect that. But since the parents have a strict stance, it's a conflict between the child's autonomy and the parents' rights. Legally and ethically, parents have the authority over their children's upbringing, including diet. Therefore, the author's not informing the sister might be considered wrong because they are not adhering to the parents' instructions for their child's care.\n"
