He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a nephew who is vegan, raised by his vegan mother, but the author (the aunt) sometimes feeds him meat when he chooses to eat it, even though she provides vegan options. The nephew is 10 years old.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. The sister is a staunch vegan, and the nephew has been vegan since birth. Feeding him meat without her knowledge could be seen as a breach of trust or going against her ethical beliefs. The mother probably has specific reasons for raising her child vegan, like health, ethical, or religious beliefs. If the aunt is allowing the child to eat meat, even if he asks for it, it might undermine the mother's efforts and values.\n\nOn the other hand, the aunt argues that the nephew is old enough to make his own choices. At 10, a child might have some autonomy, but this is a 10-year-old making decisions about his diet, which is something that parents typically have a strong say in. The aunt might be trying to respect the child's preferences, but the mother's rules at home are strict. The aunt is in a position of responsibility when the child is at her house, so she has a duty to respect the parents' wishes unless the child is in immediate danger, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nThe key points are: the mother's explicit dietary rules for her child, the aunt's role in providing meals, and the potential conflict between respecting the child's autonomy and the parents' wishes. The aunt is hiding this from the sister, which introduces an element of dishonesty. Even if the nephew is choosing the meat on his own, the aunt's decision not to inform the mother could be seen as disregarding the parents' authority and values. The husband's opinion is that the aunt is wrong because she's being dishonest, which adds to the question of whether she should have communicated with her sister.\n\nSo, considering all that, the aunt is in the wrong because she's violating the parents' trust by not informing them of the child's dietary choices during her care. The child's autonomy isn't the main issue here; the parents have the right to know how their child is being raised in other's homes. The correct answer would be A.\n"
