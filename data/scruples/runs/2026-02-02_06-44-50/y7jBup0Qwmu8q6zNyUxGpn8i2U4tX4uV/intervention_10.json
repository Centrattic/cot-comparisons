He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The sister is raising her son as vegan, and the author is providing food for the nephew when they pick up the kids. The nephew has been eating the non-vegan food, like chicken nuggets, even though vegan options are available. The main conflict is between respecting the sister's wishes and the nephew's autonomy.\n\nFirst, the sister's perspective: she's been vegan for years and is raising her son vegan since birth. That's a big commitment. She might have health or ethical reasons. The author is aware of this, so they prepare vegan meals specifically. But the nephew is eating the non-vegan food. The sister might be upset if she finds out because it's against her beliefs. The sister's husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not telling her, arguing it's dishonest.\n\nOn the other side, the nephew is 10 years old. There's an argument that he should be allowed to make his own choices, especially if he's already eating meat at school. The author might feel that by not intervening, they're respecting his autonomy. However, the sister is the parent, so she has authority over her child's diet. The author is in a position of trust, providing food for the kid when the parent isn't present. The sister could view this as undermining her parenting decisions.\n\nAlso, the author is the one providing the food, so they have control over the environment. Even if the nephew chooses the non-vegan option, the author is the one making the chicken nuggets available. Maybe they should have only offered vegan options to align with the sister's wishes. The fact that the author continues to provide non-vegan food, even if the nephew chooses it, might be seen as a breach of trust. The sister might feel betrayed if she finds out, which could strain family relationships.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the child's autonomy. At 10, he's a kid, and while he might make choices, the parent's rules are supposed to guide him. The sister's rules are in place for a reason. The author's husband points out the dishonesty aspect\u2014by not telling the sister, they're hiding information. The author might think they're protecting the sister, but it's not their place to decide. The sister has the right to know if her child is being exposed to non-vegan food when she's not there.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is probably in the wrong. They should have communicated with the sister, even if it's uncomfortable. Not telling her is deceptive, especially since the sister is the parent and has the right to enforce her dietary rules. The author's decision to continue providing non-vegan options despite knowing the sister's stance could be seen as going against the parent's wishes, which is a breach of trust. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
