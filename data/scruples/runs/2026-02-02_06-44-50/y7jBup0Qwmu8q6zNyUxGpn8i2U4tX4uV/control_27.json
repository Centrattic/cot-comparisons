He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong for giving their vegan nephew meat to eat. \n\nFirst, the sister is a staunch vegan and raises her son vegan since birth. The author is the sister's sibling, and they take both their son and nephew from school. The nephew has snacks and dinner at the author's house every weekday before his mom picks him up. The author usually makes a vegan dish for the nephew and their own family's regular meals. \n\nOne day, the author leaves the kids with snacks and chores, comes back to find the kids sharing chicken nuggets. The nephew is told those aren't vegan, and he says he eats meat at school sometimes because friends share. The author decides not to tell the sister. The husband thinks the author is being dishonest by not telling, but the author thinks the 10-year-old should be able to make his own choices.\n\nThe key points here are the age of the nephew, the parents' strict veganism, and the author's decision not to inform the sister. The author is providing vegan options but not stopping the child from choosing otherwise. The question is whether the author is wrong for not telling the mother and allowing the child to eat meat.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the child is 10, so he's a minor. Parents have the right to make decisions about their child's diet. However, the author is not the parent, so they might not have the authority to make those decisions. But since they're providing care temporarily, there's a responsibility to follow the parents' wishes. \n\nEthically, the parents expect the child to eat vegan during their care. The author is providing vegan options, which is good. But the child is choosing meat, which the parents would disapprove of. The author's decision not to inform the mother could be seen as going against the parents' wishes. However, the child is old enough to make some choices, and maybe the author feels it's part of the child's autonomy. \n\nThe conflict is between respecting the parents' wishes and allowing the child some freedom. The author might be in a tough spot because they respect the parents' beliefs but also think the child should have some independence. However, the parents might see the author's actions as undermining their parenting. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, when someone is in charge of a child, they should follow the parents' guidelines unless there's a good reason not to. The author isn't following the dietary guidelines the parents set, which could be considered a breach of trust. The husband's point is about honesty\u2014should the author have told the sister? The author argues the child can choose, but the parents might not agree. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the parents explicitly asked for the child to eat vegan, then the author is supposed to adhere to that. Allowing the child to eat meat despite the parents' wishes could be seen as not respecting their parenting choices. However, the author is giving the child a choice, which complicates things. It's a balance between respecting parental wishes and the child's autonomy. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author is supposed to enforce the parents' dietary rules. If the parents expect the child to be vegan during the author's care, then the author is in the wrong for not following through. But if there's some flexibility, maybe not. But since the parents are \"staunchly vegan,\" it's likely they want strict adherence. The author's decision not to inform them could be seen as hiding the truth, which is dishonest, hence in the wrong.\n"
