He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author feeding their vegan nephew meat without telling their sister, who is a staunch vegan.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The nephew is vegan at home, but when he's at the author's house, he sometimes eats non-vegan food. The author prepares both vegan and non-vegan meals, and the nephew chooses the non-vegan ones. The author hasn't told the sister, and the husband thinks the author is being dishonest. The nephew is 10, so the author argues he's old enough to make his own choices.\n\nNow, considering the sister's perspective: she's raising her son vegan and has ethical reasons. If she found out, she might be upset because she's against animal products. The author is respecting her choices by keeping it a secret but is also allowing the child to eat meat, which could contradict the mother's beliefs.\n\nBut the nephew is 10, which is a bit young for making independent dietary decisions. However, kids do sometimes experiment with food, especially if friends share. The author might be trying to balance respecting the child's autonomy with the mother's wishes.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the sister explicitly said the child should be kept strictly vegan, then not informing her could be seen as lying. But the sister hasn't specified that. The author is providing vegan options and not forcing the non-vegan food, just allowing the child to choose. The sister's reaction is a potential issue, but the author isn't causing harm to the child. The ethical dilemma here is about respecting parental wishes versus the child's autonomy and the author's role as an aunt/uncle.\n\nIn similar situations, the advice often leans on transparency. However, the author might be trying to protect the nephew's autonomy. But the sister's values are important. If the author is keeping this secret, maybe that's where the issue is. However, the author isn't actively hiding it, just not informing. The nephew isn't being pressured to eat vegan; he's making his own choices.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the sister would be upset, the author might be in the wrong for not being honest. But if the sister never set boundaries, maybe the author isn't. The key is intent and whether there's a breach of trust. The author isn't forcing the meat, just allowing the nephew to choose. The sister might not have considered that the child might be curious or influenced by peers. The author's actions aren't harmful, but the secrecy could be the issue. The answer might be leaning towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because they're respecting the child's choices while still providing vegan options, and the sister's reaction is a possible consequence they didn't anticipate. However, the husband's point about honesty might tip it the other way. But the author isn't lying if they aren't asked directly. Hmm. I think the answer is B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
