He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this problem step by step. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat without telling their sister. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's sister is a staunch vegan and raises her son vegan since birth. The nephew and author's son go to the same school, and the author picks them up, providing snacks and dinner each day. Normally, the author makes a vegan dish for the nephew and a regular one for their own son. However, the nephew sometimes eats the non-vegan food, like chicken nuggets. The author found out the nephew eats meat at school sometimes, so they decided not to say anything, letting him choose. The husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not telling the sister, but the author believes the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nNow, the key points here are the sister's strong ethical stance on veganism and the author's decision to not inform her. The nephew is 10 years old, which is a minor, so his dietary choices are ultimately up to his parents. The sister's beliefs are important, so the author's decision to not tell her might be seen as going against those beliefs. Also, the nephew might be eating meat he isn't supposed to, which the sister might view as a breach of trust or neglect of her parenting choices.\n\nBut there's also the argument that the nephew is old enough to make his own choices, but at 10, he's still a child, and parents are responsible for enforcing their dietary preferences. The author is in a position of trust, handling his meals, so not informing the sister could be considered a breach of that trust. The sister might feel violated if she found out that her son was eating meat without her knowledge, which could strain relationships.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be respecting the nephew's autonomy by allowing him to choose, but the parents are the ones who set dietary rules. The author's husband thinks they're being dishonest, which adds to the conflict. The sister's reaction could be severe if she finds out, which the author might regret. \n\nI think the main issue is the author's responsibility to the sister. Even if the nephew is making choices, the meals at the author's house are under their control. By not informing the sister, the author is not being transparent about what's happening with her child's diet. The sister has the right to know how her child is being fed when she's not present. The ethical dilemma here is about respecting the parents' wishes versus respecting the child's autonomy. However, since the parents hold the ethical stance, the author's non-disclosure might be seen as a breach of their agreement to raise the child vegan. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not informing the sister, which is option A.\n"
