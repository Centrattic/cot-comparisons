He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So, the user is asking whether the person (the aunt) is in the wrong for feeding her vegan nephew meat. The sister is a strict vegan and raises her son vegan from birth. The aunt provides both vegan and non-vegan meals for her nephew when he's at her house. The nephew sometimes eats the non-vegan food, even though the aunt knows the sister would be upset. The aunt's husband thinks she's being dishonest by not telling the sister, but she thinks the 10-year-old should decide for himself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The sister has specific dietary beliefs and wants her son to follow them. The aunt is respecting her sister's wishes by not telling her, but the nephew is making his own choices. At 10 years old, the child is still quite young, but maybe old enough to make some decisions. However, the mother's beliefs are strong and she might see this as a breach of trust.\n\nOn one hand, the aunt is allowing the child to explore different choices, which could be seen as supporting his autonomy. On the other hand, the mother has entrusted the aunt with her child and expects him to follow the vegan diet. By not informing the mother, the aunt might be violating that trust. The aunt could argue that she's not forcing the meat on him, he just chooses it. But the mother might argue that the aunt is undermining her parenting by not upholding the vegan diet in her absence.\n\nThe key points here are the child's autonomy versus the parent's wishes. The sister is strict about the vegan diet for ethical reasons, so the aunt's actions could be seen as going against those beliefs. However, the aunt is also in a position where she's providing care and might be trying to be lenient, allowing the child to make choices. But the sister might not approve of that. There's also the aspect of honesty between siblings\u2014should the aunt be transparent about what's happening with the nephew's diet?\n\nThe husband thinks the aunt is in the wrong for not telling the sister, but the aunt believes the child should decide. The question is whether the aunt is in the wrong by not informing the sister. If the sister is the legal guardian and the aunt is acting as a caregiver, then the aunt might be in the wrong by not adhering to the parent's dietary rules. The child's autonomy is a factor, but at 10, it's still the parent's responsibility to set dietary boundaries unless the child is old enough to make informed decisions independently, which might not be the case here.\n\nSo, the aunt's actions could be seen as a breach of trust with the sister, and possibly not respecting the sister's wishes. Therefore, the answer might lean towards AITA (Am I the Asshole) meaning the aunt is in the wrong.\n"
