He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation properly.\n\nThe author has a vegan sister who's raising her 10-year-old son as vegan. The nephew is at their house after school every day, getting snacks and dinner. The author usually makes a separate vegan meal for him. One day, the nephew and the author's son shared chicken nuggets, which the author didn't make vegan. The nephew ate the meat, even though there were vegan options available. The nephew said he sometimes eats meat at school with friends. The author didn't tell the sister about this, thinking the nephew is old enough to choose his own diet. The husband thinks the author is at fault for not being honest, but the author believes the nephew is old enough to make his own choices. The sister is very strict about her veganism and would be upset if she knew.\n\nSo the question is: Is the author in the wrong for feeding the nephew meat even though it's against his mother's wishes?\n\nFirst, let's consider the mother's perspective. She's raising her son vegan for ethical reasons. She trusts the author to provide vegan meals. The author made non-vegan food available, which the nephew then ate. The mother might see this as going against her parenting choices and ethical beliefs. The author didn't inform her, which could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the nephew is 10 years old. At that age, some parents might believe children can start making their own choices. The nephew is exposed to meat at school, so maybe he's curious or wants to try it. The author could argue that they're not forcing him to eat the vegan food and that he's making his own decisions. However, the mother might feel that the author is undermining her parenting by not stopping the nephew from eating non-vegan food.\n\nThe author's husband is concerned about honesty. If the author is deliberately not telling the sister, that could be seen as lying or keeping secrets. But the author might feel that it's the nephew's choice and that the mother would overreact if she found out.\n\nLegally, the parents have the right to raise their child according to their beliefs. Allowing the child to eat non-vegan food without the parents' knowledge could be seen as a violation. But ethically, it's a gray area. The author is providing the vegan options, and the child is choosing not to eat them. The author isn't forcing the meat on the kid, just allowing it. However, since the mother's house is the primary place where the child follows veganism, the author's home is a different environment. The question is whether the author should respect the mother's wishes more by not providing non-vegan options or by not allowing the child to access them if they're not vegan.\n\nAnother angle: The author is responsible for the child during the time they're in their care. If the mother has instructed that the child should be vegan, then providing non-vegan food could be an issue. But since the author is making vegan options available, the child's choice to eat the non-vegan food might be seen as the child's decision, not the author's. However, by providing the non-vegan food, the author is enabling the choice the mother doesn't want. So the author's role here is a bit tricky.\n\nIn terms of accountability, if the author is aware of the mother's strict veganism and the child's dietary restrictions, they might be expected to adhere to those wishes. The fact that the author didn't inform the mother suggests a lack of communication. The mother might have wanted to be informed if the child is not following the vegan diet while in someone else's care.\n\nThe nephew's age is also a factor. At 10, he's still a child, and the parents are responsible for his dietary choices. The author might think that the nephew is making his own choices, but the parents are the ones who set the rules. The author's failure to inform the mother could be seen as not respecting the parents' authority.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't forcing the child to eat meat, they are providing it and allowing the child to choose against the parent's wishes. This could be seen as a breach of trust and not honoring the parent's dietary beliefs. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong. However, there's a counterargument that the child is old enough to make choices, but since the parents are the ones making the dietary decisions, the author should have informed them. So the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong (A).\n"
