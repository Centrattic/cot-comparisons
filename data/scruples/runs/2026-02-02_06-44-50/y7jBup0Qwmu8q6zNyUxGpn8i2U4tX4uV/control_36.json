He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation involves the author's sister who is strictly vegan and is raising her son vegan since birth. The nephew is in a school where he shares meals with friends, and at the author's house, he's given vegan options but sometimes takes the non-vegan food.\n\nFirst, the sister is very strict about veganism, so she might be upset if she found out. The nephew is 10, which is a bit old to be making his own dietary choices, but still a child. The author isn't forcing him to eat meat, just allowing him to choose if he wants. The sister might see this as undermining her parenting. The author's husband thinks they're being dishonest by not telling the sister. \n\nBut on the other hand, the nephew is old enough to have some autonomy, and the author is providing vegan options. The nephew might be curious or influenced by friends. The author isn't encouraging him to eat meat, just not stopping him. The question is about the author's responsibility to inform the sister versus respecting their child's choices. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the sister's beliefs are important, but the nephew's own choices (even if he's just trying something) might be a factor. The author isn't violating any laws, but there's a social or familial obligation to consider. The key points are: the sister's strict veganism, the child's autonomy, and the author's role in not informing the sister. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author is complicit in the child eating meat, but since they provide vegan options and it's the nephew's choice, maybe not. However, the sister's right to know about her child's diet could be a factor. So, the author might be in the wrong for not informing the sister, but if the nephew is choosing on his own, maybe not. Hmm, tricky. Maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong, because the author isn't forcing the meat and is providing vegan options, and the child is making his own choices. But the husband's point about honesty could be valid. However, the sister might have a right to know, so the author is in the wrong for not telling her. Wait, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is not forcing the child, but allowing his choice, perhaps not. But if the sister would want to know, then maybe the author is in the wrong. I'm a bit torn. Maybe the answer is A because the sister has the right to know her child's diet, so the author is in the wrong for not informing her.\n"
