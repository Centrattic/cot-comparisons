He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister is vegan and raises her son that way since birth. The author picks up the nephew and their own son after school. They usually make a vegan dish for the nephew but sometimes the nephew eats the non-vegan food, like chicken nuggets. The author found out the nephew eats meat at school sometimes, so maybe he's curious or just trying. The author hasn't told the sister because they think the nephew is old enough to choose, but their husband thinks they're being dishonest.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the nephew's mother has specific dietary beliefs, the author is providing vegan options but the kid is choosing non-vegan food, and the author is keeping this a secret. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author might be in a difficult position. The sister's beliefs are important, and the nephew is a minor. Parents usually have control over their children's diets, especially for ethical reasons. However, the nephew is 10 years old, which is a time when kids might start making their own choices, but they're still under parental guidance. The author is not enforcing the vegan diet strictly, which could be seen as respecting the child's autonomy to some extent. But at the same time, the mother might not want her child exposed to meat, especially if it's against her ethical beliefs. \n\nThe author's decision not to tell the sister could be seen as lying or withholding information, which might be considered dishonest. However, the author could argue that they're allowing the child to explore his preferences without pressure, which might be a form of respect for his autonomy. But the mother's wishes are clear, and if the author is actively providing non-vegan food, even if the child chooses it, that might go against the mother's wishes. \n\nLegally, parents have the right to make dietary decisions for their children, including veganism, unless there's a health concern. Since the nephew is eating meat at the author's house, it could conflict with the mother's decisions. However, the nephew is old enough to make some choices, but not all. The line is blurry here. \n\nIn terms of social norms, some might say the author should respect the mother's wishes and not allow the child to eat meat, especially since the mother is \"staunchly vegan\" and would be upset. Others might argue that the child should have some freedom to choose, especially if he's curious. \n\nThe author's husband thinks they're in the wrong for not telling, which adds to the conflict. The author's reasoning is about the nephew's autonomy, but the mother's wishes might take precedence. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might be in the wrong because they're going against the parent's explicit wishes without consulting them. Even if the child is choosing the non-vegan option, the parent's authority in raising their child is significant. The author's decision not to inform the mother could be seen as undermining her parenting choices. Therefore, the answer might be A (in the wrong), but I need to check if there's a counterargument. \n\nAlternatively, if the author is just not stopping the child from choosing the non-vegan food without actively encouraging it, maybe it's B. But the author is providing both options, which could be the issue. If the mother wanted her son strictly vegan, the author should adhere to that. So the answer leans towards A.\n"
