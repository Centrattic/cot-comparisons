He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a person who feeds their vegan nephew meat without telling their sister, who is staunchly vegan and raising her son vegan. The author makes vegan and non-vegan meals, provides the vegan ones but allows the nephew to choose the meat. The husband is upset they didn't tell the sister, but the author thinks the 10-year-old should choose his own diet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister is raising her son as vegan, which is a personal choice based on ethical beliefs. The author is providing non-vegan options, which the nephew is choosing. The sister's beliefs are important to her, and the author is keeping this a secret. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the nephew is old enough to make his own choices. But at 10 years old, is that considered an adult decision? In many cultures, children at 10 are still under parental guidance, especially regarding diet, which can have health implications. The mother has the right to know if her child is being fed non-vegan meals, especially since she's made it clear that's against her beliefs.\n\nAlso, the fact that the nephew is eating meat at school sometimes might influence his choices. But the author is in a position of responsibility when the nephew is under their care. By not informing the mother, they're not being transparent. The husband's opinion is that the author is in the wrong for not being honest with the sister.\n\nThere's a conflict between the author respecting the nephew's autonomy and the mother's right to know what her son is eating. The author might be overstepping by allowing the child to choose without considering the mother's wishes. The sister might have specific rules at home and could be concerned about the child's health or ethical upbringing. \n\nSo, the main issue here is about honesty and respecting the wishes of the parent. Even if the nephew is choosing the meat, the author should communicate with the mother to be transparent. Not telling her could be seen as a breach of trust, especially since the sister is very strict about the vegan diet. The author's decision not to inform the sister might be seen as dishonest, even if well-intentioned. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't communicate the situation to the sister, who has the right to know about her child's diet when under someone else's care.\n"
