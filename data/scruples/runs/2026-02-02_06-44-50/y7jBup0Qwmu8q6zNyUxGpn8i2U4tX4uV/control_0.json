He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a nephew who's being raised vegan by his mom. The author, who is the sister or sister-in-law, gives vegan options but the nephew sometimes chooses to eat meat like chicken nuggets. The nephew says he eats meat at school sometimes, and the author hasn't told the sister/mom about this. The author's husband thinks she's in the wrong for not telling, but she thinks the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects. The mom is staunchly vegan and it's against her beliefs. The author is providing vegan options, which is respecting the mom's wishes, but allowing the nephew to choose otherwise when she's there. The nephew is 10, so maybe he's at an age where he can make some choices, but he's still a child. His mom's beliefs are strong, so she might be upset if she found out. \n\nThe author isn't forcing him to eat vegan food, which is good, but she's also not informing the mom. Is it the author's responsibility to report what the nephew is doing when he's not with her? Also, the nephew might be confused or influenced by his friends at school, which complicates things. \n\nOn one hand, the author is respecting the nephew's autonomy by not policing his choices. On the other hand, the mom's wishes are important, and the author might be undermining them by not being honest. The author's husband thinks she's being dishonest, which is a point to consider. But the author could argue that she's giving the nephew a chance to explore his own preferences, which is part of growing up. \n\nHowever, the mom has a right to know if her child is being exposed to non-vegan food, especially if it's happening regularly. The author's silence might be seen as a breach of trust. But maybe the author is also trying to be lenient because the nephew is around meat at school, and she doesn't want to cause unnecessary conflict. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the mom explicitly asked the author to keep her son vegan, then the author might be in the wrong by not enforcing that. But if the author is just providing options without forcing, maybe it's not her fault. However, the fact that she's hiding it from the mom might be the issue. The key point is whether the author has a duty to inform the mom. \n\nIn terms of ethics, if the mom's beliefs are so strong that she might be harmed by knowing, but the nephew's autonomy is also a consideration. However, since the nephew is a minor, his parents have the right to determine his diet. The author's actions might be interfering with that. \n\nTherefore, the author not telling the mom could be seen as dishonest, especially if the mom entrusted her to follow the vegan diet. So the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). But I'm a bit conflicted because the author is giving the nephew choices. However, the parent's dietary decisions for their child are usually respected, so the author should probably inform the mom. Hence, the author is in the wrong because she's not being transparent.\n"
