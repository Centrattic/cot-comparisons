He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the person (the aunt) is in the wrong for feeding her vegan nephew meat. The situation is that the nephew is vegan because his mom is staunchly vegan, but the aunt has been giving him vegan options but she notices he's eating non-vegan food she provides, like chicken nuggets. She doesn't correct him and continues to make both kinds of food. The sister might be upset if she finds out.\n\nFirst, the sister is raising her son vegan, which is her right. The nephew is 11 years old now. The aunt is in a position where she's responsible for him after school. She makes vegan snacks but he takes the non-vegan ones. The nephew says he sometimes eats meat at school when friends share. The aunt doesn't tell the sister, thinking the nephew is old enough to choose. The husband thinks she's in the wrong for not telling the sister.\n\nSo, is the aunt in the wrong? Let's break it down. The aunt is providing non-vegan food, which she knows the sister would be upset about. The nephew is eating it, but she doesn't inform the sister. The sister's ethical beliefs are important here. The aunt is in a caregiving role temporarily, but she's allowing the child to eat against his mom's wishes. The nephew is 10/11, which is a child; he might not be making independent decisions, especially if he's been raised vegan. Even if he's curious or trying different things, the mom's choice is about his diet. The aunt's actions could undermine the mom's parenting decisions. The aunt's husband says she's in the wrong because she's being dishonest by not telling the sister. The aunt's defense is the nephew is old enough to choose, but at 10, most parents would consider that a child isn't making informed dietary choices on their own. Also, the child might not even know the implications of eating meat. The aunt's not correcting him when he's eating non-vegan food might be seen as complicit. So, the aunt is in a position of trust with the sister's child. By not informing the sister, she's potentially violating that trust. The sister might feel her parenting is being undermined. Even if the nephew is choosing, the aunt's role is to follow the parents' instructions. Therefore, the aunt is in the wrong for not telling the sister and allowing the child to eat non-vegan food against the parent's wishes. Answer A.\n"
