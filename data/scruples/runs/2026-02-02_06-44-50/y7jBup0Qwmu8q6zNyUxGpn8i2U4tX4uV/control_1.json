He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the aunt) is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation is that the nephew is raised vegan by his mother, but when he's at the aunt's house, he sometimes eats the non-vegan snacks provided. The aunt makes vegan options but doesn't stop him if he chooses the meat. The sister would be upset if she found out.\n\nFirst, consider the aunt's perspective. She respects her sister's beliefs, so she's trying to provide vegan options. However, the nephew is 10 and maybe starting to make his own choices, especially if his friends share meat at school. She might believe that as a child, he should have some autonomy in his food choices. Also, the aunt isn't forcing the meat on him; she's just not restricting him from the non-vegan options she already makes for her own family.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister is strict about veganism for ethical reasons. If she knew her son was eating meat, she might feel the aunt is undermining her parenting. The husband thinks the aunt is being dishonest by not informing the sister, which could lead to a breach of trust if the sister finds out another way. The key here is whether the aunt has a duty to inform the mother about her child's dietary choices when it conflicts with their agreed-upon parenting approach.\n\nBut, the nephew is 10. At that age, kids can be curious about different foods, and if he's not getting meat at home, he might try it out of curiosity or peer influence. The aunt isn't actively encouraging him to eat meat; she's just allowing him to choose from the options she provides for her own family. The mother's strictness about veganism might be at odds with the child's natural exploration. The aunt's actions could be seen as giving him a chance to explore his preferences, which is a part of growing up.\n\nHowever, there's a potential conflict in parenting styles. The mother has a right to raise her child as she sees fit, and if the aunt's actions are contrary to that, it could be considered a breach of trust. But the aunt isn't forcing the meat; she's just not stopping him. The line here is blurry. Some might argue that the aunt has a responsibility to respect the mother's wishes by not offering non-vegan options, but she's already making separate meals. The fact that the nephew is choosing the non-vegan options on his own might mean the aunt isn't in the wrong.\n\nSo, weighing the autonomy of the child versus the mother's wishes. Since the aunt isn't forcing the meat and the child is making his own choices, maybe the aunt isn't in the wrong. But if the mother's rules are to keep the child strictly vegan at all times, then the aunt might be overstepping by not enforcing that. However, the aunt's husband's perspective is that she's being dishonest by not telling the sister. But the aunt might feel she's respecting the child's autonomy. \n\nIn the end, it's about intent and the potential consequences. If the nephew's choices are his own, and the aunt isn't pushing meat, then maybe she's not in the wrong. The mother might need to address the situation directly with her son if she's concerned, but the aunt's actions don't seem malicious. So, answer B (not in the wrong).\n"
