He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a parent who's taking care of her vegan nephew and son after school. She provides vegan snacks and dinner for the nephew, but he sometimes eats the non-vegan food meant for her own child. The nephew is 10, so still a minor, and the sister is very strict about her veganism.\n\nThe author didn't tell her sister about the meat-eating, which her husband thinks is wrong because it's dishonest. The nephew, though, might be making his own choices, but he's a child. The sister is raising him vegan, so the author is technically going against that by not enforcing the vegan diet. The nephew might not even be aware of the ethics behind it yet. \n\nLegally, the nephew's parents are responsible for his diet, so the aunt isn't the main authority here. By allowing him to eat meat, even if he chooses it, she's not following the parents' wishes. The sister might see this as undermining her parenting decisions. The author's reasoning is about letting the nephew choose, but since he's 10, his choices might be influenced by peers or curiosity, not understanding the ethical aspects. \n\nSo, does the author have a responsibility to enforce the vegan diet as per the sister's wishes? If she's in charge of feeding him, she might be expected to stick to the vegan meals. Allowing him to eat non-vegan food could be seen as going against the sister's values and possibly affecting the child's health or beliefs. The sister might feel betrayed if she finds out, which could strain the relationship between the families. \n\nBut on the other hand, the nephew is old enough to make some choices, and the author is providing both options. However, the sister has entrusted her child to follow a vegan diet, so the author's role might be more about adhering to that diet rather than letting the child choose. The author's husband is right in thinking she's being dishonest by not telling the sister. \n\nIn ethical terms, respecting the sister's wishes is important. The author might be justifying her actions by saying it's about the nephew's autonomy, but a 10-year-old's autonomy in dietary choices, especially when it's a strict ethical stance, isn't the same as an adult's. The sister's values are part of the parenting agreement. So, the author is in the wrong for not following through on the sister's dietary instructions and for not informing her about the situation.\n"
