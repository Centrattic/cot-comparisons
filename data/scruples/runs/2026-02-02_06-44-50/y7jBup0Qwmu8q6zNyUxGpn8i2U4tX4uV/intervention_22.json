He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat without telling their sister. The sister is a strict vegan and raises her son vegan since birth. The author provides vegan meals but sometimes the nephew eats the non-vegan food. The author hasn't told the sister, and the husband thinks they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the sister's wishes: She's raising her child vegan, and the author is aware of that. The nephew is 10, so maybe he's starting to make his own choices, but the parents are the ones making the dietary decisions. The author is a caretaker for the nephew after school, so they have a responsibility to follow the parents' instructions. By not adhering strictly to the vegan diet, the author might be undermining the parents' authority and values.\n\nThe nephew is eating meat when given the chance, but the author didn't stop him. They made separate meals, but the child chose meat. The author's reasoning is that the nephew is old enough to choose, but at 10, parents typically still guide major decisions like diet. Also, the sister might have reasons beyond just dietary preference\u2014ethical, health, or religious. The author's decision not to inform the sister could be seen as a breach of trust, especially if the sister expected her child to be strictly vegan.\n\nOn the other hand, the child might be curious or influenced by friends. But the parents' wishes are clear. The author is in a position of trust and should respect the parents' instructions. The husband's concern about dishonesty is valid because the author isn't being transparent about the child's actual eating habits. Even if the nephew chooses meat, the author should inform the parents to discuss it, rather than keeping it secret. So, the author is in the wrong for not informing the sister and allowing the child to bypass her dietary rules.\n"
