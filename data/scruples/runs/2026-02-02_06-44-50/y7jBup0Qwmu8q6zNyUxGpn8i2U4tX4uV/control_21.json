He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong (AITA). The scenario involves a parent (the author) who is feeding their vegan nephew meat when he visits their house, even though the nephew's mother is a staunch vegan and the nephew was raised vegan since birth.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author prepares separate meals, but the nephew sometimes chooses the non-vegan option. The nephew is 10 years old and shares meals with the author's son. The author's husband thinks they're in the wrong for not telling the sister, but the author believes the nephew should have the choice.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the ethical angles. The mother has specific beliefs about veganism and wants her child to follow that. The author is respecting the mother's wishes by providing vegan options but allowing the child to choose otherwise. \n\nOn one hand, the author is not enforcing the vegan diet strictly, even though they know the mother would be upset. This could be seen as a breach of trust or not respecting the mother's parenting choices. The child's dietary choices might be a parental responsibility, and the author's decision not to inform the mother could be viewed as withholding information that the mother has a right to know.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is allowing the child to make his own choices, which could be seen as supporting the child's autonomy. The nephew is old enough to understand dietary choices, and if he's choosing meat when given the option, maybe it's about his personal choice rather than the parent's strict rules. The author is also providing vegan options, so they're not forcing meat on him.\n\nBut the mother's perspective is important. If she's raising her child vegan for ethical reasons, she might see this as undermining her parenting. The author's husband's argument is about honesty\u2014shouldn't the mother know her child is eating meat elsewhere? The author is choosing not to disclose this, which could be seen as deceit, especially if the mother believes she's raising the child vegan.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that the child's autonomy is important, especially at age 10. The child is exposed to meat at school, so maybe the author is accommodating that reality. The author is also providing the vegan options, which shows they're trying to respect the mother's wishes but allowing the child flexibility.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, parents often have different approaches to their children's diets. If the author were the parent, they might have their own views, but in this case, they're acting as a caregiver in someone else's home. There's a balance between respecting the parents' wishes and the child's autonomy. \n\nThe author's decision not to inform the mother could be seen as a middle ground\u2014trying to respect both the mother's wishes and the child's independence. However, the mother has a right to know if her child is not adhering to the dietary rules she's set. The author might be in the wrong if they're knowingly allowing the child to eat meat against the mother's wishes without informing her. But if the author believes the child should have some freedom, that complicates things.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's a valid argument for the child's autonomy, the mother's right to know how her child is being cared for is significant. The author's choice not to inform the mother might be seen as disregarding the mother's parenting decisions. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the potential breach of trust and the mother's right to be informed about her child's diet. However, there's also a counterpoint about the child's agency. It's a gray area, but typically, in such cases, the parent's wishes might be prioritized unless there's a health issue. Since this is about ethics, and the mother is staunchly vegan, the author might be in the wrong for not informing her.\n"
