He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the post) is in the wrong for feeding their nephew meat without telling the sister. \n\nFirst, the situation: The sister is vegan and raising her son vegan since birth. The nephew, who is 10, is at the author's house for snacks and dinner before school pick-up. The author provides both regular and vegan meals. The nephew sometimes eats the non-vegan food, and the author hasn't told the sister about this, even though her husband thinks they should.\n\nThe author argues that the nephew is old enough to make his own choices, and maybe he's just trying the meat when he's allowed. The sister would be upset if she knew, given her strong ethical beliefs. The author is torn between respecting the sister's wishes and not wanting to interfere with the nephew's autonomy.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The sister has specific beliefs about her child's diet, which she's been following for years. The author is acting as a caregiver during the time the nephew is under their supervision. By providing non-vegan food, even if the nephew chooses it, the author might be going against the parent's wishes. \n\nBut the nephew is 10, which is a age where children might start questioning or experimenting with food choices. The author's sister might see this as a betrayal if she found out the nephew was eating meat. However, the author is also balancing their own beliefs about a child's autonomy. \n\nThe key points are: 1) The sister has made a deliberate choice to raise her child vegan. 2) The author is in a position of responsibility for the child's diet during the time they care for him. 3) The author is not informing the parent about the child's deviation from the vegan diet. \n\nIs the author violating the sister's trust by not disclosing this? If the sister had made it clear that the child should not eat meat under any circumstances, then the author is in the wrong. However, since the nephew is choosing the food himself, maybe the author is respecting his autonomy. But the parent's authority in dietary choices might take precedence here, especially since the sister's beliefs are strong.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is providing vegan options as well, so they aren't forcing the meat on the child. The nephew is making the choice, which could be seen as respecting his autonomy. But the parent might argue that the child isn't old enough to make such decisions, and the author's role is to enforce the parent's rules.\n\nIt's a tricky situation. The author is caught between respecting the parent's wishes and the child's autonomy. But since the parent is the one making the dietary decisions, the author's duty is to uphold those unless the child is old enough to make their own choices. At 10, it's debatable. Some might say a 10-year-old can make some food choices, but others might say parents should have the final say in dietary restrictions based on their beliefs.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author is bound to follow the parent's strict dietary rules, even if the child is choosing otherwise. If the parent expects the author to strictly enforce the vegan diet, then the author is in the wrong. If the parent allows for some flexibility when the child is elsewhere, then maybe not. But since the sister is \"staunchly vegan,\" it's likely she expects strict adherence. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not informing her and allowing the child to eat meat, even if it's the child's choice. But if the author's role is to provide meals with options and the child chooses, maybe it's not their fault. But since they are the one providing the non-vegan food, they might be enabling the child to go against the parent's wishes. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be A (author in the wrong) because they are facilitating the child's choice to eat meat against the parent's explicit wishes. However, the argument for B (not in the wrong) is that the child is making the choice, and the author is respecting both the parent's rules (by providing vegan options) and the child's autonomy. But since the parent might not be aware of this, the author's secrecy could be seen as a breach of trust. So, I think A is the right answer.\n"
