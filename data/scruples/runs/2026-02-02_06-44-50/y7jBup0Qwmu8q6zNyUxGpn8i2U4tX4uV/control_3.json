He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe sister is a vegan and has been raising her son that way since birth. The nephew is 10 years old, and the author is in charge of him after school every weekday. The author normally makes both a regular meal for their family and a separate vegan one for the nephew. But one day, the nephew and the author's son shared chicken nuggets. The nephew said he eats meat at school sometimes because friends share with him. The author didn't tell the sister, thinking the nephew is old enough to choose his own diet. The husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not informing the sister and being dishonest, but the author disagrees.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let's consider the key points. The sister is strict about her vegan lifestyle, and she's raising her son that way. Introducing meat goes against her ethical beliefs. The nephew is 10, which is a child who might not have the full autonomy to make such decisions, especially since parents typically guide their children's diets. Even though the nephew is old enough to understand, the responsibility for his diet still lies with the parent, in this case, the sister. The author is acting as a caregiver while the nephew is in their care, so they might have a duty to follow the parental guidelines unless there's a valid reason not to.\n\nHowever, the author is providing vegan options but the nephew chooses the non-vegan ones. The author isn't forcing the meat; it's the nephew's choice. But the sister's rules are in place to maintain her ethical stance, so the author might be complicit by not addressing it. The husband's concern is about honesty and transparency. The author might be seen as hiding information from the sister, which could cause a breach of trust if the sister finds out through someone else, like the nephew or school.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could argue that the nephew is expressing his preferences and that the sister's strictness might be leading to rebellion. But the sister's dietary choices are her personal ethics, and the author's role as a caregiver should respect those unless there's a health concern. Since the nephew isn't being harmed by the meat, but the sister's beliefs are being violated, the author's silence might be considered a breach of trust.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they aren't upholding the sister's wishes, even if they understand the sister's perspective. The nephew's choices should be within the guidelines set by his parents unless the caregiver has a different approach. The author's decision to not inform the sister could be seen as dishonest, as they knew the sister would be upset and chose not to tell her. Therefore, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
