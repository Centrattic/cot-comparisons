He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is feeding non-vegan food to their nephew who is supposed to be vegan. The sister is raising her son vegan, so there's a specific dietary choice that's part of their family values. The nephew is allowed to eat the meat when he's at the author's house, even though vegan options are provided. \n\nFirst, the author is not the parent, so maybe they have some leeway, but they're in a position of responsibility when caring for the child. The sister's beliefs are strong, and the author isn't respecting that by allowing the child to eat meat. The nephew is 10, which is a bit old to be making his own dietary choices, especially if the parents have strict guidelines. The kid might not even fully understand the ethical reasons behind veganism.\n\nThe author's husband thinks they're in the wrong for not telling the sister. The author's justification is that the nephew is old enough to choose, but the parents (the sister) might not agree. There's a conflict between respecting the parents' wishes and the child's autonomy. However, the parents are the ones making the dietary decisions for their child. By not informing them, the author is keeping this information private, which could be seen as deception.\n\nAlso, the nephew is eating meat at school sometimes, but at home, he's restricted. The author's actions might be enabling the child to have access to meat without the parents' knowledge. The sister might feel betrayed if she finds out that her child is being given non-vegan food without her consent. Even if the nephew chooses the meat, the parents' rules are in place for a reason, and the author is not upholding those rules.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author might be crossing a line by not informing the sister. The parents have a right to know what their child is eating, especially when it contradicts their parenting choices. The author's decision to not tell could be seen as dishonest, even if their intention is to respect the child's autonomy. The sister's values are important, and the author's actions might undermine the trust between them.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is likely in the wrong. They should have communicated with the sister about the situation, even if they didn't agree with her strict approach. Keeping it a secret and allowing the child to eat non-vegan food without the parents' knowledge is a breach of trust and respect for their parenting decisions.\n"
