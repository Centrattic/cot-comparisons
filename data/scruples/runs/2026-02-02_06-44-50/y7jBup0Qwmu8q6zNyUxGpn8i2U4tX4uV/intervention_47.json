He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me break this down. The situation involves a sister who's a staunch vegan and is raising her son vegan since birth. The author, the sister's sibling, takes care of the nephew after school, providing vegan meals but sometimes the nephew eats the non-vegan food given to the author's own kids. The nephew is 10 and has been eating meat at school sometimes, according to him. The author hasn't told the mom, the sister, about this, and the husband is upset about that. The author is conflicted between respecting the sister's wishes and letting the kid choose.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The sister has a strong ethical stance on veganism, which she's instilled in her son. The author is providing vegan options, but the nephew is choosing meat. The key points are: the nephew's autonomy vs. the parents' beliefs. \n\nThe nephew is 10, which is a child. In most legal and ethical frameworks, children aren't considered to have the full autonomy to make complex decisions like dietary choices, especially when those choices involve ethical or health implications. Parents are typically the ones responsible for those decisions. The sister is the parent, so she has the right to enforce her dietary rules at home. However, when the nephew is in the author's care, the author might be responsible for adhering to the parent's guidelines unless the parent has given permission otherwise.\n\nThe author is in a position of trust, acting as a caregiver. If the parent has specifically asked for the child to follow a vegan diet, the caregiver has a duty to uphold that unless instructed otherwise. By not informing the sister, the author is potentially violating that trust. Even if the nephew is choosing the meat, the author's role is to respect the parent's wishes. The fact that the nephew is eating meat at school doesn't absolve the author from ensuring the same at home unless the parent is aware and okay with it.\n\nAlso, the nephew's statement about friends sharing meals at school might not be a valid excuse for the author to ignore the parent's dietary rules at home. The parent's rules are specific to their own home and the care they've entrusted to the author. The author's husband thinks it's dishonest not to tell, which adds another layer of conflict in the household.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could argue that the nephew is old enough to make his own choices. But again, for a 10-year-old, that's debatable. Parents are usually the ones who make such decisions for their children. The author might be overstepping by allowing the child to choose against the parent's wishes. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in a position where they have a responsibility to uphold the parent's dietary guidelines. By not informing the sister, they're being dishonest and not respecting the parent's wishes. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
