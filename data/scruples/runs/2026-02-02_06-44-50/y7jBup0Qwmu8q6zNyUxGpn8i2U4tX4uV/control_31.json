He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation is that the sister is strictly vegan and raises her son that way. The author sometimes provides non-vegan snacks, and the nephew eats them even though he's been told they're not vegan. The author's husband thinks they're at fault for not telling the sister, while the author thinks the nephew is old enough to choose.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The nephew is 10, so a child. His mom is vegan and has ethical reasons for his diet. The author is providing the non-vegan food, maybe without the mother's knowledge. The nephew is choosing to eat the meat, but does a 10-year-old have the autonomy to make such a choice? Legally, he's a minor, so his parents make decisions for him. Ethically, is it the author's responsibility to enforce the mother's dietary preferences even if the child wants to eat meat?\n\nThe mother might have good reasons for her dietary choices, possibly health or ethical. If the author is undermining that by giving him meat, maybe that's a problem. But the author is also trying to respect the mother's beliefs by providing vegan options. However, by not telling the mother that the nephew is eating meat, the author is keeping it a secret. Is that dishonest? The nephew might be doing it on his own, but the author isn't stopping him. The husband's argument is about honesty with the sister.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could argue that the nephew is old enough to make his own choices, but at 10, children often still rely on adults to guide them. The mother might not be aware of the situation because the author hasn't told her, which could lead to conflict if discovered. The author is in a position where they have to balance respecting the mother's wishes and the nephew's autonomy. \n\nI think the key points are about the age of the child and the parent's expectations. Since the mother is the one setting the dietary rules, the author might be violating that by not enforcing the vegan diet. Even if the nephew is choosing, the author isn't informing the mother, which could be seen as deceitful. So the author might be at fault. However, the author is trying to respect the mother's wishes by offering vegan options, which complicates it. But in the end, the mother has the authority over her child's diet, so the author might be in the wrong for not upholding that. Answer A.\n"
