He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about their vegan nephew eating meat when visiting their house.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The sister is raising her son vegan, and the author is providing separate vegan meals. But the nephew is eating the non-vegan food, like chicken nuggets. The author hasn't told the sister yet, and the husband thinks they're in the wrong. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nSo, the main issue is about respecting the sister's dietary choices versus the nephew's autonomy. The nephew is 10, so maybe old enough to make some choices. However, the sister is strict about her veganism for ethical reasons. The author isn't forcing the vegan food on the nephew but isn't stopping him from eating the meat either.\n\nI should consider the parents' rights. The sister is responsible for her son's diet. If the author is allowing the nephew to eat non-vegan food without her knowledge, is that interfering with her parenting? The nephew might be making his own choice, but he's a child, so his parents' views on nutrition and ethics are important. The author might not be in the wrong if they're providing options and not forcing anything. However, the sister has the right to know her son's diet isn't being followed as she intended during his time at the author's house.\n\nAlso, the author's husband thinks they're in the wrong for not telling, which suggests a conflict between respecting the sister's wishes and the nephew's autonomy. The answer might depend on cultural norms or legal aspects, but since it's a family matter, it's more about ethical considerations.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the sister expects the nephew to stay vegan during visits, then not informing her might breach that trust. But if the author is giving choices and not forcing, maybe they're not wrong. However, the sister might not be aware that her instructions aren't followed, so the author has a responsibility to communicate if they can't enforce the vegan diet.\n\nHmm. The author is providing vegan options but allowing the nephew to choose otherwise. Since the nephew is a minor, his parents' dietary guidelines are in place for a reason. The author not informing the sister could be seen as not respecting her parenting decisions. Therefore, maybe the author is in the wrong for not being honest about the situation.\n"
