He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation involves the nephew being raised vegan by his mother, but the author, who takes care of him after school, provides both vegan and non-vegan options. The nephew sometimes eats the meat, and the author isn't telling his mother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and practical aspects. The mother is very strict about being vegan, and the nephew's dietary choices are part of her ethical beliefs. The author respects this and even provides vegan meals, but allows the nephew to choose meat if he wants. The key points here are consent and the nephew's age. The nephew is 10 years old. At that age, can he truly make an informed choice about his diet? His mother is making that choice for him based on her values. If the author is enabling him to go against his parents' wishes, that could be an issue. \n\nThen there's the aspect of informing the mother. The sister is strict, and if she knew, she might be upset. The author's husband thinks they're being dishonest by not telling. So, is the author being deceptive? They are aware of the mother's stance but are not disclosing that the child is eating meat. That could be seen as a breach of trust or not acting in line with the mother's wishes.\n\nOn the other hand, the nephew is old enough to express his preferences. Maybe he's curious or influenced by peers. The author could argue they're giving him autonomy. But parents usually have the right to make decisions for their children until they're of age. The author's actions might contradict the parents' parenting choices. \n\nAnother angle is the potential health implications. The child is being raised vegan, which might not be nutritionally complete, so the child's choice to eat meat could be healthier. However, the mother's decision is based on ethical reasons, not health. The author might be acting in the child's best interest health-wise, but that's a different concern from the mother's ethical stance.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, as someone in a caregiving role (picking up the kids, providing meals), the author has a duty to communicate any changes in the child's routine or diet to the parent. Not informing the mother could be seen as neglecting that responsibility, especially if the mother's values are being disregarded.\n\nBut there's also the point about the nephew's autonomy. If the child is expressing a desire to eat meat, is it right to restrict that? The author is providing the option, which might be a way to let the child explore his preferences. However, the parents have the authority to set the dietary rules for their child. The author's role is to follow the parent's guidelines unless there's a compelling reason to deviate, like health concerns.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is in a tricky position. They respect the mother's wishes by providing vegan options but allow the child to choose otherwise. However, by not informing the mother, they might be overstepping their role as a caregiver and undermining the parent's decisions. The ethical dilemma here is between respecting the parent's authority and the child's autonomy. Since the child is only 10, the parents' authority is stronger. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not informing the sister and allowing the child to eat meat without her knowledge.\n"
