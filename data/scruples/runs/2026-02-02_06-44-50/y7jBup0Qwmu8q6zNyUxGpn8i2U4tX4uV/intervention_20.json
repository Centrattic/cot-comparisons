He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. So, the situation is about a sibling's child who's vegan, but the author is giving him meat. The sister is strict about her son being vegan since birth. The nephew sometimes eats the non-vegan food when given the option.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points here. The sister is raising her son as vegan, which is her choice, and the author is providing vegan snacks but the nephew eats the meat offered. The author didn't tell the sister, and the husband thinks the author is in the wrong for being dishonest. The nephew is 10, so maybe old enough to make choices, but some might argue that the parents' wishes should be respected.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is respecting the sister's wishes. The sister is raising her son vegan, so she likely has strong beliefs about it. The author is providing non-vegan food, which the nephew is choosing. The question is whether the author is overstepping by not informing the sister.\n\nOn one hand, the nephew is a child, and parents have the right to make decisions about their child's diet. If the author is feeding the child non-vegan food without the parent's knowledge, that could be seen as a breach of trust. The sister might feel that her parenting choices are being undermined. Also, if the nephew is eating meat because he's curious or influenced by friends, but the parent's home is the only strict vegan environment, the author's home is introducing an alternative.\n\nOn the other hand, the nephew is 10, which is a time when kids start making their own choices. The author might believe in giving the child options and letting him decide. Plus, the author is making vegan options available, so the child isn't forced to eat meat. However, the sister's stance is strict, and the author's actions could lead to conflict if revealed.\n\nThe husband's opinion is that the author is being dishonest by not telling the sister. Honesty is important in such family dynamics. Even if the author believes the nephew can choose, the sister might not want her son exposed to meat at all. The author's silence could be seen as a lack of communication, which is a problem.\n\nBut then again, the author isn't explicitly encouraging the nephew to eat meat. They're just not stopping him when he chooses. Maybe the author is trying to be flexible and not push veganism, allowing the child to explore. However, respecting the sister's wishes is a key factor here. If the sister is the legal guardian and the author is acting without her consent, that's a problem.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, the sister has the right to raise her child according to her beliefs unless there's a health issue. The author's actions might be seen as interfering with that. Even if the author is providing vegan options, the act of allowing the child to choose non-vegan could be conflicting with the parent's values.\n\nSo, the author is in a position where they have to balance respecting the sister's parenting choices with their own beliefs about allowing the child to make choices. The key issue here is not just the act of providing meat, but the lack of communication. The sister has the right to know what's happening in her child's care, even if it's temporary. The author's decision to withhold this information might be the part that's considered in the wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be AITA for the author because they are not transparent with the sister about the nephew's diet while in their care, which could conflict with the sister's parenting decisions.\n"
