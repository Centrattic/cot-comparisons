He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation is that the nephew is being raised vegan by his mother, but when visiting the author's house, he's eating non-vegan food. The author makes separate meals, but the nephew chooses the meat. The author isn't telling the sister, and the husband thinks they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The sister is strict about veganism, which is her choice, but the nephew is 10 years old. At that age, he might not have the full autonomy to make such decisions, even if he's trying to explore. The mother has a right to know what her child is eating, especially if it's against her values. The author is withholding that information, which could be seen as dishonesty. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the nephew is just curious or influenced by his friends. But the author's responsibility when caring for him includes communicating with the parent about his well-being, including diet. By not telling the sister, the author might be respecting the nephew's choices but violating the trust with the sister. \n\nThe husband thinks the author is in the wrong, which adds another perspective. The key points here are autonomy vs. parental rights. The mother is making a choice for her child's diet, so the author's actions might interfere with that. Even if the nephew is eating the meat, the mother should be informed to make her own decisions. \n\nSo, the author is withholding information that the parent has a right to know. That seems like a breach of trust, hence they might be in the wrong. But maybe there's a middle ground where the author could discuss it with the sister without being confrontational. However, the author hasn't done that yet. So, answer A.\n"
