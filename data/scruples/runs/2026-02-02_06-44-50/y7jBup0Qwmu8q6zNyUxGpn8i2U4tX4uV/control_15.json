He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a 10-year-old nephew who's been raised vegan since birth. The author, who takes care of him after school, provides both vegan and non-vegan snacks. The nephew often chooses the non-vegan options, and the author hasn't told the sister (the mom) about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, there's no issue here. The nephew is a minor, but the author isn't a legal guardian. The mother has the right to make dietary choices for her child. By allowing the nephew to eat non-vegan food, the author might be undermining the mother's parenting decisions. Ethically, it's about respecting the mother's wishes. The mother is \"staunchly vegan\" and would be upset if she knew. The nephew is 10, which is an age where he might have some autonomy, but children often follow their parents' rules unless they're old enough to make independent decisions. However, 10 might not be old enough for that level of autonomy, especially in a household where the parents have strict beliefs.\n\nThe author's husband thinks they're in the wrong for not being honest, which relates to transparency. The author is keeping a secret that could be important to the mother. Even if the nephew is choosing the non-vegan food, the mother should be informed. The author's justification is that the nephew might not get meat at home, but that's part of the mother's choice. Allowing the child to have non-vegan food without the mother's knowledge could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is providing vegan options, which shows they respect the mother's wishes. But by not informing the mother about the nephew's choices, they might be causing a conflict later if the mother finds out another way. The key here is consent and communication. The mother hasn't given permission for the nephew to eat non-vegan food, so the author is making a decision without that consent.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is not respecting the mother's authority and the family's values by not informing her. The nephew's autonomy is limited by his age, and the mother's right to make decisions for her child is paramount. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
