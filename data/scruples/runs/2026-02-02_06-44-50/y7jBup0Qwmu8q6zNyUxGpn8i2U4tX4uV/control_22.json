He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation involves a 10-year-old boy who's been raised vegan by his mother. The author provides vegan snacks and dinner but also makes non-vegan options. The nephew sometimes eats the non-vegan food, and the author hasn't told the mother about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' expectations. The mother is very strict about being vegan, so she might be upset if she finds out. The author is respecting the mother's wishes by providing vegan options, which is good. But the nephew is choosing to eat meat, which he's not allowed at home. The author's husband thinks they're being dishonest by not telling the mother, but the author feels the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nNow, the key points: The mother's rules about her son's diet, the nephew's age and autonomy, and whether the author is respecting the mother's wishes by not informing her. \n\nThe nephew is 10, so he's a minor, and his dietary choices are typically up to his parents. The author is providing both options but isn't enforcing the vegan diet strictly, allowing the nephew to choose. However, the mother's rules are being circumvented. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they are going against the mother's explicit wishes by not informing her that the child is eating non-vegan food. The mother might have made the decision to raise her son vegan for ethical reasons, so the author's actions could undermine that. The nephew isn't making the choice independently; he's being given options that his parent hasn't approved. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they're not respecting the mother's rules. They're providing non-vegan food without the mother's consent, which could be seen as deception. Even if they think the nephew should have autonomy, as a minor, his parents' decisions take precedence. \n\nHowever, some might argue the author is trying to be flexible, especially since the nephew is exposed to meat at school. But the mother's stance is strict, so the author's actions could be considered a breach of trust. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they aren't honoring the mother's dietary rules for her child, which is a significant ethical issue from the mother's perspective.\n"
