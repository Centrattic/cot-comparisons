He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author has a 10-year-old nephew who's being raised vegan by his mom. The author provides vegan snacks and meals for the nephew when he's at their house, but the nephew sometimes eats the non-vegan food meant for the author's son. The author found out about this but hasn't told the sister, thinking the nephew is old enough to make his own choices. The husband is upset about not informing the sister, while the author is conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The nephew is 10, which is a young age, but maybe old enough to understand some choices. However, he's been raised vegan since birth, so his mom's values are pretty strict. The author is respecting the mom's wishes by providing vegan options but allowing the nephew to choose otherwise. But the mom might see this as violating her parenting decisions. \n\nIs the author's responsibility to enforce the mom's dietary rules, or is it okay if the child makes his own choices? Legally, parents have the right to make decisions about their children's diet, especially based on ethical beliefs. So if the nephew is eating meat against his mom's wishes, maybe the author should inform her. But the author is trying to be respectful and not interfere. \n\nOn the other hand, the nephew is at the author's house, and the author is making an effort to provide vegan options. The nephew is choosing to eat non-vegan food, possibly out of curiosity or peer influence. The author's decision not to tell the sister could be seen as protecting the nephew's autonomy, but it might also be seen as going against the parent's wishes. \n\nThe husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not telling the sister, which adds another layer. The author might be in a dilemma between respecting the sister's rules and allowing the child some freedom. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't forcing the meat on the nephew, just providing it. However, the sister's strict vegan beliefs might consider this a breach of trust. The key here is whether the author's actions are within the bounds of respecting the sister's wishes. Since the author is providing vegan options, but the nephew is choosing otherwise, maybe the author isn't responsible for the nephew's choice. But the sister might argue that the author should prevent it. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (B) because they are respecting the nephew's autonomy and providing the required vegan options. However, the sister's perspective is valid if she believes the author is not upholding her dietary rules. But since the author is making an effort to provide vegan food and the nephew is making his own choices, the author isn't necessarily wrong. The answer could be B.\n"
