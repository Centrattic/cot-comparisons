He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a nephew who's been raised vegan but ends up eating meat when visiting the author's house. The author is conflicted about whether to tell the sister about this.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from different angles. The sister is a staunch vegan and raised her son that way. The nephew is 10 years old. The author provides vegan meals but sometimes the nephew eats the non-vegan options. The author hasn't told the sister yet, and the husband thinks they're in the wrong for not being honest. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not informing the sister.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the nephew's autonomy versus the parents' beliefs, the potential deception by the author, and the ethical implications of allowing a child to eat meat against the parents' wishes.\n\nOn one hand, the author respects the sister's beliefs and is trying to provide vegan options. The nephew might be exploring his own preferences, especially since he's in school where friends share food. At 10, some might argue he's old enough to make his own choices, but others might say parents should be informed about their child's diet.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister might consider it a betrayal if she finds out the author didn't inform her. The parents might feel their values are being undermined. The author's husband thinks they're being dishonest, which adds to the tension.\n\nI should consider if there's a duty to inform the parents about their child's diet, especially since it's against their strict vegan principles. The author's silence could be seen as keeping a secret that affects the child's upbringing. But the author might also be protecting the nephew's autonomy and not wanting to cause conflict.\n\nIn terms of ethical frameworks, deontological ethics (duty-based) might say the author should tell the truth regardless of consequences. Utilitarianism might look at the outcomes: telling the sister could cause stress and conflict, but not telling might continue the nephew's exposure to meat. The nephew's well-being is also a factor\u2014is eating meat harmful to him physically? The sister's ethical stance is about animal rights, which is a different concern.\n\nAnother angle: the author isn't forcing the nephew to eat meat. He's given options. The author isn't lying; they're providing vegan meals and letting the nephew choose. However, by not informing the sister, there's an element of not being transparent about the nephew's habits. The sister might have wanted to know to address it at home.\n\nThe key issue is whether the author has a responsibility to report the nephew's dietary choices to the parent. If the author is acting as a caregiver for the nephew during the time he's at their house, there might be an expectation to adhere to the parents' dietary instructions. If the parents had explicitly asked the author not to give the child meat, then allowing it would be a breach. However, in this case, the sister is just raising her child vegan, but the author isn't necessarily bound to enforce that unless they've agreed to it.\n\nThe nephew's age is another factor. At 10, it's possible he's making independent choices, but the parents are still responsible for his upbringing. The author's silence could be seen as enabling the child to act against his parents' wishes without their knowledge. However, the author isn't actively encouraging meat-eating; they're just not correcting the child's choices.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision to stay silent might be seen as a middle ground, but it's a gray area. They're respecting the nephew's autonomy and the sister's beliefs in their own way. However, the sister might view the author's silence as a form of deception, which could strain their relationship. The husband's point about dishonesty is valid because the author isn't being truthful with the sister about the nephew's diet. But on the other hand, the author isn't directly violating any rules since the sister didn't specify that they must prevent the nephew from eating meat during visits.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer hinges on whether the author has a duty to inform the sister. If the author's role is to support the parents' wishes, then not informing them could be considered wrong. If the author sees their role as a neutral caregiver allowing the child to have some freedom, then it's less clear. The sister's potential reaction is a significant factor. If the author is lying by omission, that's a form of dishonesty. However, if the author is providing vegan options and the child chooses otherwise, maybe it's not entirely the author's fault. The line between allowing autonomy and respecting parental authority is thin here.\n"
