He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation is that the sister is vegan and raising her son vegan since birth. The author gives vegan options but sometimes the nephew eats the non-vegan ones, like chicken nuggets. The nephew says he eats meat sometimes at school, and the author hasn't told the sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's perspective. She's very strict about veganism, so if she found out, she might be upset. The author's husband thinks they're being dishonest, but the author believes the 10-year-old should choose his own diet. \n\nThe key points here are consent and parental authority. The sister is the parent making the dietary choices for her son. The author, as an aunt, might not have the right to override those decisions. Even if the nephew is 10, he's not old enough to make such decisions on his own, especially when it's about health and ethics. The author is providing non-vegan food without consulting the parent, which could be seen as undermining the sister's parenting.\n\nOn the other hand, the nephew might be curious or influenced by peers. The author could argue that they're not force-feeding him, just making the option available. But the sister's choice to raise her child vegan is a personal belief, and the author's actions might contradict that. The author's husband's concern about honesty is valid because not telling the sister could be seen as hiding something important about their child's diet.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the aunt crossed a boundary by not informing the parent about the child's consumption of non-vegan food. Since the sister is the parent making those choices, the aunt's actions could be considered in the wrong because they're not respecting the parent's decisions. The right approach would be to communicate with the sister to find a solution that respects her parenting.\n"
