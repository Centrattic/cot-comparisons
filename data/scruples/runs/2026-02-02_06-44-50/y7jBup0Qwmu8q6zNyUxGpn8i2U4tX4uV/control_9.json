He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation is that the sister is a strict vegan and raises her son vegan since birth. The nephew eats at the author's house daily, and the author provides both vegan and non-vegan options. The nephew sometimes chooses the non-vegan food, and the author hasn't told the sister about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The sister's beliefs are strong, and she wants her son to follow a vegan diet. The author is respecting her wishes by providing vegan options, but allowing the nephew to choose the non-vegan ones. The key point here is whether the author is violating the sister's trust or the child's upbringing by not informing her about the meat consumption.\n\nThe nephew is 10 years old. At that age, some might argue he's old enough to make his own choices, especially if he's exposed to different options. However, the child is under the care of his parents, and the parents have specific dietary rules they've chosen for ethical reasons. The author is in a position where they're responsible for the child during the day but aren't the parent. This creates a conflict between respecting the parents' wishes and allowing the child autonomy.\n\nThe author's husband thinks they're in the wrong for not telling the sister. The sister might feel deceived if she finds out, especially since the author is aware of her strict stance. On the other hand, the author might feel that the child should have some freedom to explore different choices, especially if he's already eating non-vegan food at school.\n\nAnother angle is the potential health or ethical consequences. If the child is eating meat occasionally, is that significantly harmful? Or does it undermine the parents' values? The sister's reaction is likely to be strong, which adds to the complexity.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whose perspective you take. From the sister's view, the author is not following her instructions and might be enabling the child to stray from their agreed-upon diet. From the author's perspective, they're respecting the child's autonomy and not forcing veganism. However, the author is not the parent, and the parents have the final say in their child's upbringing. The fact that the author didn't inform the sister could be seen as a breach of trust, especially if the sister had explicitly asked the author not to provide non-vegan food. But in this case, the author is providing the food but allowing the child to choose. The sister might not have explicitly forbidden it, but her stance is clear. The author's decision not to tell the sister could lead to a breakdown in trust if discovered.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might believe they're acting in the child's best interest by allowing choice, the sister's expectations and the parent's authority should be considered. The author isn't explicitly violating a rule if they were allowed to provide both options, but the secrecy around not informing the sister might be the key issue here. The answer could be a nuanced B (not in the wrong) if the author is respecting the child's choices within the bounds of what they were permitted, but if the parents had a strict agreement, then A might be appropriate. Since the sister hasn't explicitly prohibited the author from providing non-vegan options, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, the husband's concern about honesty is valid. The correct answer is likely B, but there's a gray area.\n"
