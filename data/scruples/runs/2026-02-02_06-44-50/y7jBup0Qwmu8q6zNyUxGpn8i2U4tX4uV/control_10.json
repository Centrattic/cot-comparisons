He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's see... The situation is about the author feeding their vegan nephew meat when they take care of him. The sister is a staunch vegan and raised her son vegan since birth. The nephew is 10, so maybe old enough to make his own choices?\n\nThe author provides both vegan and non-vegan options, and the nephew often chooses the meat. The sister wouldn't know, and the husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not telling. But the author thinks the nephew should have the choice. \n\nHmm. Legally, the nephew isn't their responsibility, so maybe the author isn't responsible for his diet? But ethically, maybe they should follow the parents' wishes. The sister's beliefs are strong, so if the nephew is eating meat against her wishes, maybe the author is violating her trust. But the nephew is old enough to make his own choices, right? If he's choosing to eat the meat, maybe that's his decision. But the author is providing the meat, which might not be what the parents wanted. \n\nWait, the parents are the ones who decided to raise him vegan. If the author is providing non-vegan food, even if the nephew chooses it, is that against the parents' wishes? The author isn't forcing him, but they're not stopping him either. The sister might feel betrayed if she finds out. The author's husband thinks they're in the wrong for not informing the sister. \n\nBut the nephew is in a school setting where friends share food. The author might be giving him a chance to eat meat, which he doesn't get at home. Is that helping him explore his own choices, or is it undermining the parents' parenting? \n\nI think it's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, the nephew is making his own choices, and the author isn't forcing him. On the other hand, the parents have specific beliefs and might have a plan for raising their child. The author might be in the wrong for not respecting that. But maybe not, since the nephew is old enough. I'm a bit torn. Maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author isn't forcing the meat and the nephew is choosing. But others might argue that they should have told the sister. I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is A because the parents' wishes aren't being respected, even if the kid chooses. I need to decide.\n"
