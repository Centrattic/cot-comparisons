He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA question is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation is that the sister is vegan and raising her son as vegan since birth. The author provides both a family meal and a vegan one for the nephew. The nephew ate chicken nuggets once, saying he eats meat at school sometimes. The author didn't tell the sister, and the husband thinks they're in the wrong, but the author believes the 10-year-old can make his own choices.\n\nFirst, the sister's decision to raise her son vegan is her choice, and the author is respecting that by providing vegan options. However, the nephew is eating non-vegan food when given the chance. The author hasn't forced this; they prepared vegan meals but the nephew chose otherwise. The question is whether the author is wrong for not informing the sister and allowing this.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, there's no issue. Ethically, it's more nuanced. The sister's beliefs are important, and she might be upset if she knew. But the nephew is 10, which is an age where some autonomy is developing. However, children's dietary choices, especially regarding health and ethics, are typically made by parents. The author isn't the parent, so they might have a responsibility to report if they think the child is being harmed. But in this case, eating meat isn't harmful here. The sister might be upset because it goes against her ethical beliefs. \n\nThe author's actions are not deceptive because they provide vegan options. The nephew's choice to eat meat isn't forced. The sister didn't specify that the author must prevent him from eating non-vegan food during visits. The author's decision to not inform the sister could be seen as respecting the nephew's autonomy and not wanting to cause conflict. However, the sister might feel the author is undermining her parenting. \n\nBalancing these factors, the author isn't in the wrong because they're not forcing the meat on the nephew. They're providing options, and the nephew is making his own choice. The sister's ethical stance is valid, but the author isn't violating any rules set by her. The husband's view that they're in the wrong might stem from a belief in honesty, but the situation is about personal beliefs vs. child autonomy. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
