He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author feeding their vegan nephew meat without telling their sister, who is a strict vegan and raises her son vegan. The nephew is 10 years old, and the author is providing both vegan and non-vegan options. When the nephew chooses the meat, the author doesn't say anything. The husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not informing the sister, but the author believes the nephew should be allowed to make his own choices.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The sister has a strong ethical stance on veganism, and the nephew has been vegan since birth. The author is in a position of responsibility for the child, but the child is old enough to make choices. However, the sister's beliefs are important here. Legally, if the author is the legal guardian of the nephew, they might have responsibility, but in this case, the nephew is being picked up by his mother daily, so the author is just a temporary caregiver during the school pickup times.\n\nThe main issue is whether the author should inform the sister about the nephew eating meat. The author is providing both options, which seems reasonable. The nephew is making his own choices, which the author is allowing. But there's a potential conflict with the sister's beliefs. The sister might feel that the author is undermining her parenting if she finds out. However, the nephew is in a different environment, and the author is respecting the nephew's autonomy.\n\nIs the author being dishonest by not telling the sister? The author is not lying; they're just not informing. The sister might not be aware of the situation, so the author is keeping it private. But if the sister is the parent and the author is providing care, maybe there's an obligation to inform. On the other hand, the nephew is old enough to decide, and the author is following the sister's instructions by providing vegan options. The husband's opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but the author's reasoning is about the nephew's autonomy.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author is violating the sister's wishes. If the sister explicitly told the author to only provide vegan food and not allow any meat, then the author would be in the wrong. But the scenario says the sister is raising her son vegan, but the author is in a different setting. The nephew is choosing to eat meat when given the option. The author's actions aren't forcing the meat but allowing the choice. The sister might be upset if she finds out, but the author isn't necessarily being dishonest. They're respecting the nephew's autonomy while still providing the vegan options as instructed. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, there's a responsibility to inform the parent about the child's behavior. But since the author is not the guardian and the situation is temporary, maybe it's not their place. It's a bit of a grey area. I think the answer hinges on whether the author should inform the sister. The author's decision not to tell could be seen as protecting the nephew's autonomy but also as hiding information. Depending on cultural or familial expectations, this might vary. But in terms of ethics, respecting the parent's wishes versus the child's autonomy. If the parent expects strict adherence to veganism in all settings, then the author is in the wrong. But if the parent allows flexibility, then not. Since the sister is \"staunchly vegan,\" perhaps the author is in the wrong for not informing her. But the author is allowing the nephew to choose, which could be seen as respecting his autonomy. It's a tough call. Maybe the answer is A (in the wrong) because the author is not fulfilling the responsibility to inform the parent about the child's dietary choices, even if they are made by the child. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) because the author is providing the options and the nephew is making the choice. I'm leaning towards A because the parent might expect the author to report such behavior, especially given the parent's strong beliefs. So the author is in the wrong by not informing.\n"
