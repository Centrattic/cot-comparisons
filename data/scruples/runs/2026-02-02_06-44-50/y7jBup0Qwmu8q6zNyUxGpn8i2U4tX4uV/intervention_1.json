He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The sister is raising her son vegan since birth, and the nephew is now 10. He's been eating non-vegan food at the author's house, even though they provide vegan options. The author didn't tell the sister, and now the husband is upset because they think it's dishonest. The nephew says he sometimes eats meat at school from friends.\n\nSo, the key points here are the sister's strict vegan beliefs and the author's decision not to inform her. The nephew is old enough to choose, but the sister might not be aware of his choices. The author is providing vegan options but not stopping the nephew from eating the non-vegan food. They didn't confront the sister because they thought she'd freak out. The question is whether the author is wrong for not telling her.\n\nFirst, consider the sister's perspective. She's raising her son vegan for ethical reasons. If she knew he was eating meat elsewhere, she might be upset or concerned. The author's decision to not inform her could be seen as hiding the truth, which might be disrespectful to the sister's parenting choices. However, the nephew is 10 and might be making his own choices, which the author is not forcing him to eat. The sister's strictness could also be a factor here\u2014maybe the author is trying to protect the nephew from potential conflict if the sister finds out. \n\nBut the sister has the right to know about her son's diet, especially if it's going against her beliefs. The author is in a position of responsibility since the nephew is under their care after school. By not informing the sister, they're not being fully transparent, which could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the nephew is choosing on his own, the author is the one providing the non-vegan food. The sister might argue that she's the one making the dietary decisions for her child, and allowing him to eat meat without her knowledge undermines that. \n\nOn the other hand, the nephew is old enough to have some autonomy, and the author might believe they're respecting his choices. However, the sister's parenting style and ethical stance should also be considered. The author's husband thinks they're in the wrong, which adds another layer. The dilemma here is balancing the nephew's autonomy with the parent's wishes. \n\nIn terms of legal or ethical responsibility, the author isn't the parent, so their role is more about supervision. They should communicate with the sister to find a solution that respects both the parent's beliefs and the child's choices. By not doing so, the author could be seen as acting against the sister's wishes, even if their intentions are good. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't communicate with the sister, which is essential in such situations. The sister has the right to be informed about her child's diet, especially when it conflicts with her parenting decisions. The author's secrecy, even with good intentions, could be viewed as dishonest or disrespectful to the sister's beliefs.\n"
