He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a vegan nephew who's eating meat when visiting the author's house, and the author isn't telling the nephew's vegan mother about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angles here. The mother is raising her son to be vegan, which is a strict dietary and ethical choice for her. The nephew is 10 years old, so there's a question about whether he can truly make his own dietary decisions. But he's old enough to understand the basics, maybe. \n\nThe author provides vegan options but doesn't stop the nephew when he eats the non-vegan food. The author's husband thinks they're in the wrong for not telling the sister. The author's reasoning is that the nephew might be curious or missing meat, and the sister might get upset if she knew. \n\nNow, the key points: the nephew isn't supposed to be eating meat according to his mother's wishes. The author is facilitating the child's choice to eat meat in their home, which could be seen as undermining the mother's parenting. But the author isn't forcing it; the nephew is making the choice on his own. \n\nIs it the author's responsibility to report this to the mother? The mother entrusted her son to the author's care, so there's an expectation that the author would respect the child's dietary restrictions. However, the child might be making his own choices, and the author might believe it's his personal choice. \n\nBut minors are still under the care of their parents, so the parents' wishes should be respected. The author's silence could be seen as not honoring the parent's trust. Even if the author respects the vegan stance, not informing the parent could be considered a breach of trust, especially if the parent would be upset. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is allowing the child to explore different choices, which might be developmentally appropriate. But the parent's wishes about their child's diet are a significant factor here. The line between respecting a child's autonomy and respecting parental wishes is tricky. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong because they're not upholding the parent's expectations. The parent has a right to know that her child is being given non-vegan options by someone she trusts. The author's decision to not inform the sister could be seen as deceptive, even if it's out of kindness. \n\nBut wait, maybe the author is giving the child some autonomy. However, in the context of a parent's strict dietary rules, the author's actions might be conflicting. So the answer leans towards A, the author is in the wrong because they're not respecting the parent's wishes and the trust placed in them. \n\nAlternatively, maybe not in the wrong. If the child is making his own choices, but the parent would be upset, the author is in a dilemma. But the parent's wishes should be prioritized. So the answer is A.\n"
