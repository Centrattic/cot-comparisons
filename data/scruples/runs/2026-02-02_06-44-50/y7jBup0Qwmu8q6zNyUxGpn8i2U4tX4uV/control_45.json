He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation is that the nephew is raised vegan by his mother, but when he's at the author's house, he sometimes eats the non-vegan food provided by the author's son. The author has been making vegan dishes for the nephew but doesn't stop him if he chooses the meat option. The author's husband thinks they're in the wrong for not telling the sister, while the author believes the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The mother is strict about veganism for ethical reasons. The nephew is 10 years old, so he's a minor, which might mean the parents have the authority to decide his diet. However, the nephew might be experimenting with food choices, which is common for children his age. The author is providing alternatives but not forcing him to eat vegan, so it's not like they're intentionally giving him meat. The question is whether the author has a duty to inform the mother about this, especially since the mother would be upset. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, minors' diets are typically the parents' responsibility. Ethically, the author is respecting the nephew's autonomy by allowing him to choose, but the parents have the right to enforce their dietary choices. However, the nephew is in a different environment when at the author's house, so the author isn't required to enforce the parents' rules unless there's a prior agreement. The author might be in a gray area here. \n\nThe key points are: Is the author obligated to inform the mother? Does the nephew have the right to choose his own diet at 10? The mother's reaction could be severe if she finds out. The author's decision not to tell could be seen as protecting the nephew's autonomy, but the parents' wishes are being disregarded. \n\nI think the answer hinges on the parents' expectations. If the mother trusted the author to maintain the vegan diet during visits, then the author is in the wrong. But if the parents knew the child might have access to other food options, maybe not. The scenario doesn't mention prior discussion, so it's possible the author is overstepping by not enforcing the vegan diet. However, the nephew is making his own choices, which could be seen as developing independence. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's husband thinks they're in the wrong, which suggests societal expectations might lean towards respecting the parents' wishes. But the author's reasoning is about the nephew's autonomy. It's a balance between respecting parental authority and allowing a child to explore. Since the nephew is old enough to understand the difference, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. But the parents might expect the extended family to support their dietary choices. \n\nIn conclusion, it's a bit of a toss-up. The author isn't directly violating any rules if they provided vegan options but didn't force the nephew to eat them. However, not informing the parents could be seen as a breach of trust. The answer might depend on cultural norms and family dynamics. But based on the given info, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they're providing the vegan options and the nephew is choosing on his own. However, the parents might have a valid concern if they believe their child's diet should be strictly vegan even in other households.\n"
