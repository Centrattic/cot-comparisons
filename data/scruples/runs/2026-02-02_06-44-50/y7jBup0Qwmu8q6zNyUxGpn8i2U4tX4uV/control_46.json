He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat without their sister knowing. The sister is a staunch vegan and the nephew has been raised that way since birth. The author provides vegan food but the nephew often chooses the non-vegan options, sometimes even eating the meat provided. The husband is upset that they didn't inform the sister, while the author thinks the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The sister's beliefs are about ethical eating, so she might see this as a big issue. The nephew is 10, which is a young age to make such decisions independently, but maybe he's starting to form his own opinions. However, parents typically have the final say in their children's upbringing, especially regarding diet. The author is acting as a caregiver, so they might have a responsibility to respect the parents' wishes unless there's a reason not to.\n\nThe author is in a position where they are responsible for the child during certain hours, so they might think they can offer alternatives. But the sister's trust is important here. If the parents are strict about a vegan diet, the caregiver might be expected to enforce that. The nephew's choice to eat meat could be seen as a violation of the parents' trust, even if the nephew is making the choice himself.\n\nHowever, there's also the argument that the nephew is old enough to explore different options and that the author isn't forcing him to eat vegan. But the parent's perspective is about their child's upbringing and ethical beliefs. The author might be seen as undermining the parents' authority by not preventing the meat consumption. The husband's concern is about honesty and transparency, which is a valid point.\n\nOn the other hand, the nephew might not understand the reasons behind the vegan diet, and the author could be giving him a chance to try different foods. But since the parents are strict, the author's actions could be considered a breach of trust. The key here is whether the caregiver's role includes enforcing the parents' dietary choices, which they might be expected to do.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they're not adhering to the parents' wishes, even if they provide vegan options. The parents might expect the child to stick to vegan meals while in their care. The nephew's choice isn't necessarily valid if it goes against the parents' established rules. Therefore, the author should inform the sister to maintain transparency and respect her wishes.\n"
