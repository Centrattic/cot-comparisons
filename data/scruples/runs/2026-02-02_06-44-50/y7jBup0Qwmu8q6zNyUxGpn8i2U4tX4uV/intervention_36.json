He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the aunt) is in the wrong for feeding her vegan nephew meat. The sister is raising her son vegan, and the aunt is in charge of him after school. The aunt provides both vegan and non-vegan options, and the nephew ends up eating the meat. The sister would be upset if she knew.\n\nFirst, the situation involves a child's diet. The parents have specific beliefs about their child's diet, which the aunt is supposed to respect. The nephew is 10, so maybe he can make some choices, but he's still a minor. The parents' wishes are clear, and the aunt is the one in charge of him during that time. \n\nThe aunt is giving both options, but the non-vegan food is available. The nephew chooses it sometimes. The aunt knows the sister would be upset if she found out. The question is whether the aunt is in the wrong by not informing the sister and allowing the child to eat meat.\n\nOn one hand, the aunt is following the sister's request by providing vegan options. But if the child is eating non-vegan food at school and now at her house, maybe she's enabling him to eat meat when he's with her. The sister's beliefs are ethical, so she might consider this a betrayal. The aunt's husband thinks she's in the wrong for not telling the sister. \n\nBut the aunt argues the nephew is old enough to make choices. However, the child's parents have the final say in their dietary choices. The aunt isn't the parent, so she should follow the parents' instructions unless there's a conflict. Since the parents explicitly want the child to be vegan, the aunt's actions might be going against that. \n\nSo, even if the nephew is choosing the non-vegan option, the aunt is responsible for adhering to the parents' wishes. By not telling them, she's withholding information that the parents might need to address. Therefore, the aunt is in the wrong.\n"
