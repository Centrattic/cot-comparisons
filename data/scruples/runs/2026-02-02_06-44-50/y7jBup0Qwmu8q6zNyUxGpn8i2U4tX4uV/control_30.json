He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation is that the sister is a long-time vegan and raises her son vegan. The author provides both vegan and non-vegan options, and the nephew sometimes eats the meat, even though the author knows the sister would be upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The nephew is 10 years old, so the author is saying he's old enough to make his own choices. But the sister is strict about the vegan diet, which is based on ethical beliefs. The author hasn't told the sister, which the husband thinks is dishonest. \n\nOn one hand, the nephew is a child, and parents typically make dietary decisions for their kids. The author is allowing the nephew to eat meat when they're in charge, which might go against the mother's wishes. But on the other hand, the nephew is old enough to make his own choices, and the author is providing options. The author isn't forcing the meat on him but is allowing him to choose. \n\nThe sister's beliefs are important here. If the author had asked the sister's permission or discussed it, maybe it would be different. But by not telling her, the author is acting behind her back. The husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not being honest. \n\nBut maybe the author isn't forcing the meat; they're just not correcting the nephew when he chooses it. The nephew might be influenced by his friends at school, so the author is letting him explore. However, as a parent, the sister might see this as undermining her parenting. \n\nSo, depending on the perspective: if the author is acting in the child's best interest by letting him choose, but the sister's wishes are being disregarded. The ethical dilemma is between respecting the parent's dietary beliefs and allowing the child some autonomy. \n\nIn many cases, parents are the ones who decide their children's diets, especially for ethical reasons. Allowing the child to eat meat without the parent's knowledge could be seen as going against that. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consult the sister and are allowing the child to eat against the parent's beliefs. However, the child is old enough to make choices, so maybe the author is justified. \n\nBut the key issue is whether the author is respecting the sister's wishes. Since the sister is the parent, the author should consider her views. Maybe the right approach would be to discuss it with the sister instead of keeping it secret. So the author is in the wrong because they are not being honest with the sister and allowing the child to eat meat without her knowledge.\n"
