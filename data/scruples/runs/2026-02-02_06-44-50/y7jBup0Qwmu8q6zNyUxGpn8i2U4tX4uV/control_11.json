He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The sister is a staunch vegan and the nephew is being raised vegan. The author provides vegan meals but the nephew often eats the non-vegan options. The husband thinks they're in the wrong for not telling the sister, but the author thinks the nephew is old enough to choose.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister has a strong ethical stance, so the author might be worried about causing conflict. The nephew is 10, so maybe he's at an age where he can make some choices, but he's still a child, right? His mom is making decisions for him until he's older. Also, the sister might have good reasons for the vegan diet, like health or ethics, so the author's actions could be against her wishes.\n\nBut then, the author isn't forcing the vegan food on him. They're offering options. The nephew is choosing the non-vegan food. However, the sister might not be aware of the choices her son is making outside her home. The author is keeping it a secret, which could be a problem if the sister's rules are important. But maybe the author respects the child's autonomy.\n\nOn one hand, the sister's wishes are being ignored if the nephew is eating meat. On the other hand, the nephew is making his own choices, even if he's young. But parents typically make decisions about their children's diets until they're older. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they're undermining the mother's parenting choices. However, if the sister knew, she might be upset, but the author is trying to be respectful by not telling her. It's a tough balance between respecting the parent's wishes and allowing the child some autonomy.\n\nI think the main issue is whether the author should have informed the sister. The sister has the right to know what's happening to her child, even if it's inconvenient. The author's decision to keep it a secret could be seen as deceptive. But if the nephew is choosing to eat meat, maybe he's exploring his own preferences. However, as a parent, the sister's authority is important. The author might be in the wrong because they're not upholding the sister's dietary rules. Alternatively, they might not be in the wrong if the child is old enough to make some choices. But I think the consensus here is that the parent's wishes should take precedence, so the author might be in the wrong.\n"
