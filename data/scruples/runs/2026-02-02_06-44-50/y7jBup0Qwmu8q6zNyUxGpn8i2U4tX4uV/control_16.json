He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent who is vegan and is raising their son vegan. The aunt, who takes care of the nephew after school, is giving him meat, even though the nephew usually chooses the non-vegan option. The sister (the mom) would be upset if she found out. The aunt's husband thinks she's in the wrong for not telling, but she believes the 10-year-old should decide for himself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angles here. The mom is strict about veganism, and the nephew has been raised vegan since birth. The aunt is providing both vegan and non-vegan options, but the nephew is choosing the non-vegan ones. The aunt isn't stopping him, but she also isn't telling the mom. The question is whether the aunt is in the wrong for not informing the mom about her son eating meat.\n\nOn one hand, the aunt is respecting the child's autonomy, allowing him to make his own choices. At 10 years old, some might argue he's not fully responsible yet, but she's giving him the choice. However, the child's parent has specific beliefs and might consider this a breach of trust or a violation of their parenting choices. The aunt's husband thinks she's being dishonest by not telling the mom. \n\nBut the aunt isn't forcing the child to eat meat; she's just not preventing him from choosing the non-vegan option. The key point is whether she has an obligation to inform the mother. Since the mother is the one making the dietary decisions for the child, the aunt might be overstepping by not informing her. However, the aunt could argue that she's not encouraging the non-vegan diet, just allowing the child to make a choice during the time she's in charge.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the aunt is the one providing the food, she has a duty to the parent to adhere to the agreed-upon rules. If the parent didn't explicitly say that the nephew must not be exposed to non-vegan food, then maybe it's not the aunt's fault. But if the aunt knew the parent's strict stance, then not informing her could be seen as a breach of trust. The aunt might be in a gray area here. \n\nThe child is making his own choices, but the aunt is the one in a position of responsibility. If the parent had communicated clearly that the child should not be given non-vegan options, then the aunt is in the wrong. However, if the parent didn't specify, then the aunt might be justified in allowing the child to explore his preferences. But since the aunt is aware of the parent's strong stance, even if she's not directly encouraging the meat-eating, not informing the parent could be considered dishonest. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the aunt had an agreement with the parent about the child's diet during her care. If there was an understanding that the child would remain strictly vegan, then the aunt is in the wrong. If there was no such agreement, then maybe not. But since the aunt is making a deliberate choice to offer non-vegan options and not tell the parent, even though she knows the parent would be upset, that could be seen as being in the wrong because she's not being transparent. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because she's not being honest with her sister about the dietary choices she's allowing for her son, even if the child is making the choice. The parent has a right to know what's happening during the time the child is in her care, especially regarding something as important as diet and ethical beliefs.\n"
