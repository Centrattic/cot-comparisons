He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent who is vegan and raising their son vegan. The sister (the author's sister) is strict about this. The nephew, who is 10, is often at the author's house and is given both vegan and non-vegan options. The nephew sometimes eats the non-vegan food, like chicken nuggets, and the author doesn't tell his mom, even though the mom would be upset.\n\nFirst, the author's responsibility. The nephew is under their care while at their house. The mom has specifically asked for him to be vegan. The author is providing non-vegan options, which goes against the mom's wishes. Even if the nephew chooses to eat the non-vegan food, the author is the one offering it. The question is whether they should have discussed this with the sister or not.\n\nThe nephew is 10, so maybe he's starting to make his own choices, but he's still a child. His mom's beliefs are very strong, so she might see this as a breach of trust. The author's husband thinks they're being dishonest by not telling the sister, which adds to the ethical dilemma.\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel like they're respecting the nephew's autonomy, but the parent's wishes are clear. The author could have talked to the sister to find a compromise, like discussing the situation and maybe adjusting the meals. By not doing that, they're keeping it a secret. The author's actions could lead to the mom feeling betrayed if she finds out later. So, is the author in the wrong for not being honest with the sister, even if the nephew is choosing the non-vegan food? It seems like the author is in the wrong because they're enabling the nephew to go against the parent's wishes without communication. So the answer would be A.\n"
