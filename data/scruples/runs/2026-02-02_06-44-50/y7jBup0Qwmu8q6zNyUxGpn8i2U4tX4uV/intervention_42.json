He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a vegan nephew who's eating meat when he's at the author's house. The author is providing vegan options but the nephew chooses the non-vegan food. The sister is very strict about being vegan, and the author hasn't told her about this. The husband thinks they're in the wrong for not telling, while the author believes the nephew should decide his own diet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The sister is raising her son vegan, so she has specific beliefs and values about his diet. The nephew is 10 years old, which is a time when children can start making some choices, but they're still young. The author is in a position where they're responsible for the nephew's snacks and meals, so there's a duty to respect the parents' wishes unless there's a compelling reason not to.\n\nThe author is providing vegan options, which is good. But the nephew is choosing the non-vegan food. The key issue is whether the author should inform the sister. The author is withholding information, which could be seen as dishonesty. Even if the nephew is making his own choices, the parents have entrusted the author with their child's care, including diet. If the parents don't know, they might not be aware of the compromise in their child's diet, which goes against their values. \n\nThe author's husband thinks they're in the wrong because they're being dishonest. From a loyalty standpoint, the author might feel they're respecting the nephew's autonomy, but the parents' wishes are clear. The author's decision to not inform the sister could be seen as a breach of trust, especially if the sister is \"staunchly vegan\" and would be upset. \n\nOn the flip side, the nephew is old enough to make choices, and maybe the author is allowing him to explore his preferences. However, the parents have the right to dictate their child's diet unless there's a risk of harm. Since the nephew is eating meat in school sometimes, maybe the parents aren't entirely strict, but the author is still responsible for enforcing the vegan diet during the time under their care.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't communicate with the sister. There's a balance between respecting the child's autonomy and honoring the parent's wishes. The author's decision to stay silent could be considered dishonest, even if their intention is to let the child choose. The sister has the right to know how her child is being raised, especially regarding dietary restrictions that are part of her ethical beliefs.\n"
