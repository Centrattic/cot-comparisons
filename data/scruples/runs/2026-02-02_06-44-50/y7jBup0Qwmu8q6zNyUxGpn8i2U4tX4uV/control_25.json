He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation is that the sister is a vegan and has her son on a vegan diet since birth. The author, who has their own kids, gives vegan meals to the nephew but sometimes he eats the non-vegan food, like chicken nuggets. The nephew says he eats meat at school sometimes. The author didn't tell the sister, and the husband thinks they're wrong for not telling her. The nephew is 10, so the author argues he's old enough to make his own choices.\n\nHmm. First, the main issue is whether the author is violating the sister's wishes. The sister is raising the child vegan, so she probably expects the author to follow that. The author is providing vegan options but not stopping the child when he chooses the meat. The child is 10, so maybe he's becoming more independent. But the sister might not want the child to get used to eating non-vegan food. \n\nThe author didn't tell the sister, which the husband thinks is dishonest. But the author is trying to respect the nephew's autonomy. However, the sister's beliefs are strong, so maybe the author should have discussed it with her first. The nephew might be influenced by friends, but the author's role is to support the sister's parenting unless there's a conflict. \n\nIs the author overstepping by not informing the sister? The sister's decision is based on ethical beliefs, so the author might be undermining that by allowing the nephew to eat meat. The child is 10, but in terms of diet, especially with ethical choices, the parents are the ones making those decisions. The author might be in the right by not forcing the child to eat vegan, but perhaps should have communicated with the sister. \n\nBut the author is not the parent. Maybe they have a duty to the sister to uphold her dietary choices for the child. If the author is a legal guardian, that's different, but since it's a nephew, the sister is the parent. So the author might not have the authority to decide the child's diet. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not informing the sister and allowing the child to eat non-vegan food against her wishes. The answer would be A.\n"
