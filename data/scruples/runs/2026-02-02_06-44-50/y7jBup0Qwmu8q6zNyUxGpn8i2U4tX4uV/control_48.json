He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a parent who is raising their son vegan, and the aunt is feeding him meat sometimes when they're at her house. The nephew is 10 years old now. The aunt is making vegan options but when the kid takes the meat instead, she doesn't tell his mom. The husband thinks she's being dishonest and in the wrong, but the aunt believes the kid is old enough to choose.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The mother is a staunch vegan and the kid has been vegan since birth. The aunt is providing vegan snacks but the kid sometimes eats the non-vegan options. The aunt didn't tell the mother about this. The key question is whether the aunt is in the wrong by not informing the mother and allowing the kid to eat meat.\n\nFrom the mother's perspective, she's entrusting the aunt with her son's care, including diet. If the aunt is going against her dietary preferences without communication, that could be seen as a breach of trust. The mother might feel that her parenting choices are being undermined. The aunt might argue that the child is old enough to make his own choices, but at 10, many parents still guide their children's diets. Also, the mother's ethical stance is important here; she might see this as a violation of her values.\n\nOn the other hand, the aunt is trying to be respectful by providing vegan options but not forcing the kid. However, by not informing the mother, she's keeping a secret that the mother might not appreciate. The aunt's reasoning is that the kid is making his own choices, but the mother's intention was for the kid to be vegan. The fact that the kid is eating meat at the aunt's house could conflict with the mother's beliefs and the child's upbringing as per her wishes.\n\nThe husband's perspective is that the aunt is being dishonest by not telling the mother. Honesty in such matters can be crucial, especially if it's about the child's diet. The aunt might not want to cause conflict, but withholding information could be seen as deceitful, especially if the mother is likely to find out eventually or has strict views on the matter.\n\nIn terms of the child's autonomy, at 10, some might argue he's capable of making choices, but dietary decisions are often guided by parents, especially when it's a matter of ethical or health reasons. The mother is making an active choice for her child to be vegan, so allowing the child to deviate without her knowledge could be seen as undermining that choice.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the aunt's decision not to inform the mother might be the main issue here. Even if she's providing vegan options, allowing the child to eat non-vegan food and not informing the parent could be considered a breach of trust and respect. The mother has a right to know about her child's diet, especially when it goes against her values. Therefore, the aunt might be in the wrong for not being honest with the mother.\n"
