He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 10-year-old nephew who's raised vegan but eating meat when at his aunt's house. The aunt makes vegan and non-vegan options, and the kid chooses the meat. The parents are strict vegans and would be upset if they knew.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical angles. Legally, there's probably nothing wrong here. The aunt is providing food, and the child is making his own choices. But ethically, it's trickier. The parents have entrusted their child's care to the aunt when she picks him up. If the child is eating meat contrary to the parents' wishes, that could be seen as a breach of trust. However, the aunt isn't forcing the meat; she's just allowing the child to choose. The child might be influenced by peers at school, so the aunt isn't necessarily encouraging it. \n\nThe nephew is 10, so he's old enough to understand the difference, but he's still a child. The parents have specific beliefs, and the aunt is respecting their wishes by providing vegan options. However, by not preventing the child from eating the non-vegan food, is she overstepping? Or is she allowing the child to explore his preferences, which is part of growing up? \n\nThe husband thinks she's in the wrong for not telling the sister. But the aunt might believe that the child should have some autonomy. There's a balance between respecting the parents' wishes and the child's autonomy. If the parents had explicitly told the aunt not to offer non-vegan food, then the aunt would be wrong. But since she's making vegan options and the child is choosing otherwise, it's a gray area. \n\nAnother angle: the aunt isn't lying. She's providing options. The child is making his own choice. The aunt isn't lying to the sister; she's just not informing her. However, the sister might feel that any deviation from veganism is a breach of their agreement. So, maybe the aunt is in the wrong for not honoring the sister's wishes. \n\nBut then again, the child is in a different environment. Maybe the aunt is just accommodating the child's needs, especially if he's eating meat at school. The sister might not be aware of the school situation. The aunt might be trying to be lenient, which could be seen as compassionate. \n\nI think the key points are: 1) The parents' explicit wishes vs. the aunt's actions. 2) The child's autonomy. 3) Whether the aunt is deceiving the sister or not. If the aunt isn't actively encouraging the meat-eating and is just allowing the child to choose, she might not be in the wrong. But if the parents expected the child to strictly adhere to veganism at all times, then the aunt is not fulfilling that expectation, making her in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer could be B (No) if we consider the child's autonomy and the aunt's respect for the parents' wishes by providing vegan options. But if the parents had strict rules about the child's diet even outside the home, then A (Yes). The post doesn't mention that the parents specified no meat even when with the aunt. Therefore, the aunt might not be in the wrong because she's not violating any explicit rules and is allowing the child to make his own choices within reason.\n"
