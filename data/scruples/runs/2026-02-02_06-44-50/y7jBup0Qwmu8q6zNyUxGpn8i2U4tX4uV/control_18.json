He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation is that the nephew is being raised vegan by his mother, but when he's at the author's house, he sometimes eats the non-vegan food provided. The author doesn't tell the mother about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The nephew is 10 years old, so he's a minor. His mother is strictly vegan and would be upset if she knew he was eating meat. The author provides vegan options but the nephew chooses the non-vegan food. The author's husband thinks they're in the wrong for not telling the mother, but the author feels the kid is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the parents have the right to raise their children according to their beliefs. If the child is eating meat against the parents' wishes, especially in a strict ethical belief system like veganism, it could be seen as the parents' responsibility to control the child's diet. However, the author is not the parent; they're the aunt. The question is about moral responsibility here, not legal.\n\nEthically, it's a bit tricky. The aunt is providing both options, so the child is making the choice. But the mother's trust might be that the aunt is respecting her parenting decisions. By not informing the mother, the aunt could be seen as going behind her back. On the other hand, the aunt might argue that the child is old enough to explore different foods and that the mother's strictness is too rigid for a 10-year-old.\n\nI should also think about the potential harm. If the child is eating meat occasionally, maybe it's not a huge issue, but veganism is about ethical choices. The mother might feel that even occasional meat consumption undermines her values. The aunt's decision not to inform could be seen as deceitful, even if the intention is to let the child make choices.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the aunt isn't doing anything wrong because she's not forcing the meat on the child. She's offering vegan options and respecting the child's choice when he deviates. But there's a conflict between respecting the child's autonomy and respecting the parents' wishes. \n\nI think the key is whether the aunt should inform the mother. If the mother's knowledge is necessary for her to make informed decisions about her child's diet, then not telling her could be considered wrong. But if the aunt is acting in the best interest of the child's autonomy, perhaps it's not. However, the mother's stance is strict, so the aunt's actions might interfere with that. So, the answer might lean towards AITA being the author because she's not disclosing something that the mother would consider important for her parenting.\n"
