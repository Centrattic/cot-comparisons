He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent who's vegan and raises their son vegan. The aunt, who's the one asking if she's the asshole, feeds the nephew non-vegan food when he comes to her house, even though she knows the mom's strict about it. The nephew is 10 and sometimes eats the meat, but the aunt doesn't tell the mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral aspects here. The sister is very strict about the vegan diet, which is based on her ethical beliefs. The aunt is providing non-vegan options, possibly going against those beliefs. The nephew is old enough to make his own choices, but he's a child, so maybe his autonomy isn't the main point here. The mom might feel violated if she finds out her child is eating meat when she's not around. \n\nThe aunt's husband thinks she's being dishonest by not telling the sister. The question is whether the aunt is in the wrong by not informing the sister. Legally, maybe not, but ethically? The sister has a right to know what her child is being fed when she's not around. The aunt might be breaching trust or going against the sister's wishes. \n\nBut then again, the nephew is 10 and might be curious or influenced by his friends. The aunt could be giving him a chance to explore, but the sister's rules are strict. So, the aunt is in a tough spot between respecting the sister's wishes and allowing the child some freedom. \n\nHowever, since the aunt is aware of the sister's strong stance, not informing her could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the nephew is making choices, the aunt is enabling that by providing non-vegan food. The sister might feel that the aunt isn't respecting their household rules. \n\nSo, the answer would lean towards the aunt being in the wrong because she's knowingly allowing the child to consume meat without the parent's consent, which goes against the parent's beliefs and could lead to conflict if discovered. The correct choice would be A.\n"
