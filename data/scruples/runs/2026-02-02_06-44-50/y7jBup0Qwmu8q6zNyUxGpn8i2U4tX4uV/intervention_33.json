He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a person who's taking care of their vegan nephew after school. The nephew's mom is a staunch vegan, and the kid has been raised vegan from birth. The author has been providing vegan meals but sometimes the nephew ends up eating non-vegan food like chicken nuggets. The author found out the nephew eats meat at school sometimes and decides not to tell his mom, even though her husband thinks that's wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral and ethical aspects here. The nephew is 10 years old. At that age, kids are starting to form their own preferences, but they're still young and heavily influenced by their parents' upbringing. The mom has strong ethical beliefs about veganism, so she's probably strict about it. The author is in a position where they're providing meals, and the nephew is choosing non-vegan options when given a choice. The question is whether the author should intervene more or report this to the mother.\n\nFrom one side, the author could argue that the nephew is old enough to make his own choices. If he's choosing non-vegan food when he's not at home, maybe he's exploring different options. But on the other hand, the mother has a right to know that her child is being exposed to non-vegan food, especially if she's concerned about his health or ethical beliefs. The author isn't violating any laws, but they might be going against the mother's wishes and potentially undermining her parenting.\n\nThe author's husband thinks they're being dishonest by not telling the mother. If the mother asked the author about the meals, would the author be lying if they said they were sticking to vegan options? That could be a point. Also, the nephew might not be fully aware of the reasons behind veganism, so maybe the author should explain it to him instead of just letting him choose. However, the author is respecting the mother's wishes by providing vegan options, which is good.\n\nAnother angle is the potential impact on the nephew. If he's eating meat at school and at his uncle's house, but not at home, is that causing any harm? The mother might be concerned about consistency in his diet, which could affect his health or her ethical stance. The author isn't forcing the meat on him, but they're allowing it without intervention. The question is whether this is a breach of trust with the mother.\n\nIn terms of the author's responsibility, maybe they should have set clearer boundaries. If they knew the mother's strictness, they might be obligated to inform her about the nephew's choices. However, the nephew might be making those choices independently, and the author might not want to mediate between the child and his parent. It's a delicate situation because the author is in the middle of the mother's beliefs and the child's autonomy.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author might be in the wrong because they're not being transparent with the mother about the nephew's dietary choices, even though they're providing vegan options. The mother has a right to know, especially if she's concerned about her child's adherence to veganism. The author's decision to stay silent could be seen as a lack of respect for the mother's wishes, even if they're trying to respect the child's autonomy. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
