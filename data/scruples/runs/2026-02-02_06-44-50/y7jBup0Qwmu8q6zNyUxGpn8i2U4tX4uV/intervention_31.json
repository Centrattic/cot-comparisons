He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. \n\nFirst, the sister is raising her son vegan since birth, and the nephew is vegan at home. The aunt provides vegan snacks but sometimes the nephew eats the non-vegan options because he does at school. The aunt hasn't told the sister about this, and her husband thinks she's in the wrong. The nephew is 10, so maybe old enough to choose, but the sister would be upset.\n\nThe key points here are: the nephew's diet is a family decision, and the aunt is going against it. Even if the nephew chooses the meat, the aunt is enabling it by providing non-vegan options. The sister might have ethical reasons for being vegan, so the aunt's actions could be seen as undermining that. However, the nephew is a child, and maybe the aunt is giving him a chance to decide. But the aunt isn't just allowing him to choose; she's actively providing meat, which the sister might not have intended.\n\nAlso, the aunt isn't informing the mother, which could be seen as a breach of trust. The sister's beliefs are important, so keeping this secret might be disrespectful. Even if the nephew is making choices, the aunt is influencing his environment. So, the aunt's actions could be considered wrong because she's not respecting the sister's wishes and possibly compromising the child's diet. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the nephew is old enough to make choices, and the aunt is giving him options. But the sister has a right to know what's happening, especially if she's strict about the vegan diet. The aunt's silence could be seen as inconsiderate. So, the answer is likely A (in the wrong).\n"
