He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about feeding meat to their vegan nephew. The sister is raising her son vegan since birth, and the nephew is at the author's house five days a week. The author provides vegan snacks and meals, but the nephew often chooses the non-vegan options, even eating chicken nuggets. The author hasn't told the sister yet, and the husband thinks they're in the wrong for not informing her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and practical aspects. The sister's veganism is a strict ethical stance, so if her son is eating meat without her knowledge, she might be upset. The nephew is 10, which is an age where he's starting to have some autonomy, but he's still a child. The author is providing vegan options, which shows they respect the sister's wishes. However, the nephew is choosing the non-vegan food, perhaps influenced by friends or curiosity. \n\nBut the key issue is whether the author should inform the sister. The author's argument is that the nephew is old enough to make his own choices, but as a parent, the sister has the right to know what her child is being exposed to. The author might be overstepping by not telling the sister, even if they're providing vegan options. The author's husband thinks they're being dishonest, which adds another layer. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author is trying to protect the nephew's autonomy and avoid causing conflict with the sister. But the sister has a right to control her child's diet. By not informing her, the author might be violating the sister's trust and potentially compromising the child's health or ethical upbringing according to the parents' beliefs. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because they're withholding information that the parent has a right to know. Even if they respect the sister's choices, the child's dietary habits are the parent's responsibility. The answer would be A.\n"
