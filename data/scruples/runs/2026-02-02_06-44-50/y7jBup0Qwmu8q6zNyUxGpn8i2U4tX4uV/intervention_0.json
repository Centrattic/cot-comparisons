He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author has a vegan sister who's raising her son vegan since birth. The nephew is at the author's house every day for snacks and dinner, and the author provides both a family meal and a vegan one. But the nephew ends up eating the non-vegan chicken nuggets. The author found out and the nephew said he eats meat at school sometimes because friends share. The author hasn't told the sister yet, and the husband thinks they're in the wrong for not telling, while the author thinks the nephew should decide for himself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects. The sister is very strict about her veganism, and the nephew's mother is making him vegan. The nephew is 10 years old, which is a child. Parents generally have the right to raise their children according to their beliefs, even if others disagree. The author is in a position where they're supposed to respect the sister's choices. By letting the nephew eat meat, the author might be undermining the sister's parenting decisions. But then again, the nephew is a child, and maybe he's curious or influenced by his peers. However, the author is the one in charge of feeding him during those times. \n\nThe key question is whether the author has an obligation to maintain the vegan diet as per the sister's wishes. The sister is the parent, so the author might be overstepping by allowing the nephew to eat non-vegan food. Even if the nephew wants to try it, the parent's decision should be respected. Also, the author is using their own home to provide non-vegan options, which might be seen as deceptive because they're presenting both but not discouraging the non-vegan choice. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author is trying to be kind, letting the nephew have some choice, and not wanting to be judgmental. However, the sister might not approve of that. The nephew's mother is the one who set the dietary rules, so the author's actions could be seen as going against those rules. The author might be in the wrong because they're not upholding the sister's wishes, even if they have good intentions. \n\nBut then, is it the author's responsibility to enforce the sister's dietary rules? The author isn't the parent, so maybe they shouldn't be the enforcer. But they are in a position where they are the one feeding the child, so they might have a duty to follow the parent's instructions. If they agreed to take care of the nephew with a vegan diet, then allowing him to eat meat could be seen as a breach of that agreement. \n\nThe nephew is 10, so while he's old enough to have some autonomy, his parents are the ones who decide his diet. The author's decision to not inform the sister might be seen as respecting the nephew's autonomy but disregarding the parent's wishes. There's a conflict between respecting the parent's wishes and allowing the child some freedom. \n\nIn terms of ethics, respecting the parent's choices is important, especially if the parent has a strong ethical stance. The author's husband thinks they're in the wrong because they're being dishonest by not telling the sister. The author might be seen as being complicit in a situation that goes against the sister's beliefs. \n\nSo considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they are not honoring the sister's parenting decisions. Even if the nephew is choosing, the mother's rules should take precedence in her absence. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
