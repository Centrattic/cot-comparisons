He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The sister is raising her son vegan since birth, and the author is providing vegan snacks but the nephew is choosing the meat options. The author's husband thinks they're in the wrong for not telling the sister, while the author believes the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The sister's dietary choice is based on ethical beliefs, so she might be very strict. The nephew is 10, which is an age where they might start developing their own preferences. However, parents typically have the final say in their child's diet, especially for minors. The author is providing vegan options, which they're supposed to do since they're following the sister's wishes. But the nephew is choosing to eat the meat, which the author isn't stopping. \n\nIs the author allowed to let the child make that choice? The sister might feel betrayed if she finds out, especially if she thinks the author is undermining her parenting. On the other hand, the nephew is making his own choice, even if he's only 10. But legally and ethically, parents have the authority to decide their child's diet. The author isn't forcing the meat on the nephew, but by allowing him to choose, they might be complicit in not enforcing the vegan diet. \n\nThe author's husband thinks they're in the wrong for not telling the sister. The sister has a right to know if her child is eating non-vegan food against her wishes. The author is withholding that information, which could be seen as dishonest. But the author might argue that they're respecting the child's autonomy. However, since the child is under 18, the parents' decisions generally take precedence. \n\nSo, the key points are: the author didn't force the meat, but they didn't stop the child from choosing the meat either. The sister might feel the author should have prevented that or informed her. The author's decision not to inform could be seen as a breach of trust, even if they respect the sister's views. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author might be in the wrong because they're not upholding the sister's wishes regarding her child's diet. Even if the nephew is making a choice, the parents' dietary decisions should be respected. The author's intention to let the child choose could conflict with the sister's strict vegan ethics. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not informing the sister, as they're not respecting her parental authority.\n"
