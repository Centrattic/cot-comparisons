Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe guy and the author went on a date. At the end, they were making small talk. The guy showed her a fitness post about a woman lifting weights and mentioned her weight. Then he asked the author how much she weighs. The author felt uncomfortable but answered. The guy then said she weighed more than him, which made her angry. She asked why he asked, and he said it was just curiosity, adding that she's an okay weight. She told him she didn't like the personal question. He defended himself by talking about double standards, saying guys can be discriminatory about weight since it's something they can control. The author then asked him about his insecurities regarding his dick size, which embarrassed him. He didn't apologize, and his friends later called the author an overreacting bitch for using his insecurity against him.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author was wrong to ask about his dick size in response to his comment about her weight. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the guy asked a personal question about her weight. The author felt it was sensitive and uncomfortable. She answered but then got upset when he made a comment comparing their weights. She confronted him, and he responded with a defensive attitude, bringing up double standards. Then, the author used his own insecurity about his penis size to show him how she felt. The guy and his friends thought she was in the wrong because she used his insecurity, even though he didn't know she was insecure about her weight.\n\nNow, considering consent and mutual respect in conversations. When someone asks a personal question, it's generally expected to keep the conversation respectful. However, if the question makes the other person uncomfortable, they have the right to express that. The author did that, but the guy didn't back down and instead made a comparison that could be seen as hurtful.\n\nIn response, the author asked a question she knew would make him uncomfortable. The question about his penis size is also a personal and sensitive topic. However, using his own insecurity as a way to highlight the double standard might be seen as a form of retaliation. But is that wrong? If he brought up a sensitive topic first, then the author's response could be a way to illustrate the problem she had with the initial question. However, asking about his penis size might be crossing a boundary, especially if it's not necessary for the conversation. Even though he was the one who started by asking about her weight, the author's response could be seen as using his vulnerability against him, which might not be fair.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy's comments about her weight were also using her sensitive topic. He made a comment that could be interpreted as her being fat, even if he didn't mean it that way. His defense about double standards might be invalid, but he did bring up a personal topic first. The author's reaction could be about standing up for herself and showing the inconsistency in his behavior.\n\nSo, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the context. If she was trying to mirror his behavior to show him the issue, it might be a form of teaching a lesson, but it's possible she went too far by bringing up a sensitive topic he didn't ask about. However, if the guy's initial question was inappropriate, then the author's response might be justified as a way to highlight the problem. The friends' reaction is also questionable, as they blamed her without understanding her perspective.\n\nIn terms of social norms, asking about someone's weight is generally considered more personal and potentially offensive than asking about penis size, but both are sensitive topics. The key is whether the author's action was a proportionate response. Since the guy initiated the personal question and then made a comment that upset her, her response might be a way to demonstrate how his behavior made her feel. However, using his insecurity directly might be seen as exploiting his vulnerability, even if it's about a topic he's known to be insecure about in the friend group.\n\nAnother angle is consent. Did the guy ever ask about her weight in a way that implied he wanted a reciprocal question? Probably not. So, even if he's known to be insecure, bringing up his penis size without his consent might be crossing a line. But if the author's intention was to make him understand her perspective by putting him in her shoes, then it's a form of reciprocal behavior. However, this could be seen as unfair if the topics are not equivalent in terms of societal sensitivity or personal boundaries.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong because she was responding to the guy's initial inappropriate question and trying to show him the impact of his words. However, her method of using his insecurity might be seen as crossing a boundary, which is why her friends labeled her as the asshole. But the main issue lies in the guy's initial behavior and his lack of empathy. The author's response was a form of self-defense in communication, but the appropriateness of her method is debatable. Since the question is about whether she is in the wrong, the answer could lean towards her not being in the wrong (B) because she was reacting to his actions and trying to highlight the double standard, even if her method was questionable. However, some might argue that she shouldn't have taken the conversation further by asking about his penis size, making her equally at fault (A). The key is whether the response was a fair reaction to the initial transgression.\n"
