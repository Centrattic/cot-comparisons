Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy asking the author about her weight, which she found uncomfortable, and then she responded by asking about his penis size. The guy didn't apologize, and now her friends are calling her an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and mutual respect. The guy asked a personal question about her weight, which she didn't appreciate. She felt it was invasive and made her uncomfortable. Then, when he didn't apologize, she retaliated by asking about his penis size, which is another personal question. The friends are saying she used his insecurity against him, which might be a point.\n\nBut on the other hand, the guy's initial question about weight is also considered a personal topic that's often seen as taboo. He might not have realized how sensitive it was for her. However, his response when she challenged him was dismissive, calling her sensitive and bringing up double standards. That could be seen as invalidating her feelings.\n\nThe author's actions in asking about his penis size could be seen as using his insecurity to teach him a lesson. But is that fair? Maybe she thought it would make him understand her discomfort, but it's possible that her approach was inappropriate because it's another personal question. However, she did stop when he asked her to, so maybe she wasn't being malicious.\n\nThe key points are mutual respect and the nature of personal questions. Both topics are sensitive. The guy shouldn't have asked about her weight without considering her feelings, and she might have overreacted by reciprocating with a personal question. However, she did address his behavior and tried to make him see her perspective. The friends' reaction is also part of the context, as they're blaming her for overreacting.\n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. If the guy's question was rude, then the author's response might be justified as a form of self-defense in communication. But using someone else's insecurity could be seen as manipulative. However, she might have been trying to mirror his behavior to make a point. \n\nIn terms of social norms, both topics are considered private. So both parties might have crossed a line. But the initial question from the guy was the first transgression, and the author's response was a reaction to that. The question is whether her retaliation is worse or not. \n\nConsidering that she asked the question and then stopped when he was uncomfortable, maybe her actions were not malicious. But the friends are right in pointing out that she knew about his insecurity. Using that knowledge to ask a personal question could be seen as exploiting his vulnerability. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether retaliation is acceptable. If we consider that both should avoid personal questions, then both are at fault. However, the original question was more about the author's actions. If the author's intent was to teach him a lesson, but her method was also inappropriate, then she might share some responsibility. But if the guy started it, then she's justified in pushing back. \n\nIn conclusion, it's a bit of a toss-up. However, given that personal questions are generally off-limits, and she did reciprocate with another personal question, even if it was to make a point, it might place some of the responsibility on her. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong), but there's a strong case for B as well.\n"
