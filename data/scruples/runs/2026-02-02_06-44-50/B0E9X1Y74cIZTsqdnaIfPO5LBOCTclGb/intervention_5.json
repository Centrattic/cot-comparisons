Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after a situation where a guy asked her weight, and she then asked about his dick size in response. \n\nFirst, the guy initiated by asking her weight, which she found uncomfortable. He then made a comment that made her feel he was implying she was fat. She confronted him, and he didn't apologize. She used his insecurity about his dick size to ask him, which embarrassed him. His friends criticized her as overreacting.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The user thinks she is, but I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nThe guy's question about weight was personal and possibly insensitive. She had a right to feel uncomfortable, especially if it made her feel judged. However, her response was to ask about his dick size, which is also a personal and sensitive topic. While she might have been trying to illustrate the double standard (since he complained about girls being discriminatory over things like height, which he can't control, and then he asked about her weight, which he claims she can control), her approach might have been confrontational. \n\nThe key point is whether asking about his dick size was a proportionate response. By using his insecurity against him, she might have escalated the situation in a way that's unkind, even if her intention was to highlight hypocrisy. However, the initial question from him was the trigger, and she was responding to his hurtful behavior. \n\nAlso, the guy's friends' reactions suggest a double standard in how such topics are treated between genders. The guy felt he could ask about weight (something he can't control, according to his argument), but when she asked about his size (something he perceives as controllable), it was seen as cruel. This highlights societal differences in how these topics are addressed.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, both parties acted in ways that could be seen as inappropriate. The guy asked a personal question that made her uncomfortable, and she retaliated by asking a similarly personal question. However, the context is important: she was responding to his behavior. If the guy was genuinely insensitive, her action was a way to show the hypocrisy. But from the perspective of others, her response might be seen as taking advantage of his insecurity, especially since she was aware of it.\n\nThe debate here is about whether her response was justified. If the initial question was wrong, then her response might be a form of pointing out the inconsistency. However, the method could be problematic. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking the question in return. \n\nConsidering that the guy started the interaction with a question that led to uncomfortable comments, and the author was trying to make a point about double standards, it's possible she wasn't in the wrong. However, using his insecurity in a direct and personal way could be seen as crossing a line, even if her intent was to show hypocrisy. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the response was an appropriate form of confrontation. If the guy's actions were indeed insensitive, then the author's response could be a valid form of standing up for herself. But others might see her as overreacting and using his vulnerability against him. \n\nGiven the context, the author might not be in the wrong because she was responding to his insensitivity, but the method of her response could be questionable. However, the question is whether she is in the wrong. If the initial question by the guy was the problem, and her response was a way to highlight the double standard, then the fault isn't entirely hers. However, using a personal question in return might be seen as retaliating in kind, which could be seen as the wrong approach. \n\nIn the end, the answer is likely B (No), because the author was responding to the guy's inappropriate behavior, and her action was a way to point out the hypocrisy. However, the method might not be the best, but it doesn't make her the asshole if the initial question was the issue.\n"
