Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to understand the key points.\n\nSo, the guy asked the author how much she weighs during a date. She felt uncomfortable and responded with \"excuse me?\" before answering. He then made a comment about her weighing more than him, which she found offensive. She challenged him about the question's purpose, and he defended it, bringing up double standards about body issues. She then asked him about his dick size as a response, which he found embarrassing. His friends later called her an overreacting bitch.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author overstepped. The guy asked a personal question about weight, which is sensitive. The author felt uncomfortable and addressed it, which is valid. Her asking about his dick size was a direct response to his comment about weight being a controllable trait. She used his insecurity to highlight the difference in how such questions are received based on gender.\n\nNow, considering social norms: asking about someone's weight is often seen as intrusive, especially in a one-on-one conversation. The guy's comment about her weight made her defensive. His friends' reaction suggests they didn't see the issue with his initial question, but maybe they were biased in his favor. The author's use of his insecurity was a way to show the double standard, which is a valid point in discussions about gender and body image.\n\nBut was her approach appropriate? She did ask a personal question in return, which could be seen as retaliating. However, the context was that he initiated the sensitive topic. Her motivation was to make him understand her perspective. The key here is whether the author's response was a reasonable way to address the discomfort caused by his initial question. Since he brought up weight, which is sensitive, and then made a comparative comment, her asking a reciprocal question might be a way to highlight the gender disparity in such issues.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that she shouldn't have taken the conversation that direction, even if it was in response. But given the context, it seems like she was trying to draw attention to the hypocrisy or double standard he mentioned. The friends' judgment of her as the \"asshole\" might stem from not seeing the gendered aspects of the situation or being defensive of their friend.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the initial question from the guy was inappropriate, and the author's discomfort was valid. Her response, while personal, was a form of pointing out the double standard he was bringing up. So, maybe she isn't in the wrong because she was addressing the issue caused by his actions. The friends' reaction might be missing the point. The author's actions were a form of self-advocacy, which is important. So the answer is likely B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
