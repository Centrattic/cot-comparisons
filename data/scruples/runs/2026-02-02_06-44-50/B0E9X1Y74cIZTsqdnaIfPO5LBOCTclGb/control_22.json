Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The scenario involves a guy asking about the author's weight, which made her uncomfortable. She then asks him about his penis size in response, and her friends call her an asshole for it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the interactions. The guy asked about her weight, which is a sensitive topic for her. She felt uncomfortable, answered, and then he made a comment comparing his weight to hers. His response about her being an \"ok weight\" might have been dismissive or even condescending. She then confronts him, and he justifies it by bringing up a \"double standard\" regarding insecurities. \n\nThe author's response was to ask him about his penis size, which is a personal question too. He got embarrassed and didn't answer, and she stopped. The friends think she's in the wrong because she used his insecurity against him, even though he initially asked her a personal question.\n\nIs it a case of mutual respect? The guy's question about weight might be inappropriate, and then his comment about her weight could have been hurtful. The author's reaction might be seen as defending her boundaries by mirroring his approach, but perhaps she crossed a line by asking about his penis size. However, she did it to show him the impact of his words, which could be a form of teaching a lesson. But her friends argue that she knew his insecurity and used it, making her the asshole.\n\nLegal or ethical perspective isn't needed here, but more about social norms. Asking about someone's weight is generally considered rude and can be hurtful. He started the exchange with a personal question. She responded with another personal question to highlight the issue. The key is whether her response was justified. Since he was defensive and didn't apologize, maybe she was within her right to push back. However, using his insecurity might be seen as cruel, even if her intention was to show him the problem. \n\nThe friends' judgment is part of the question. They think she overreacted because she knew his insecurity and used it. But the initial question from him was the start of the problem. The author's actions were a direct response to his behavior, which he didn't take responsibility for. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong because she was asserting her boundaries in response to his inappropriate question and comments. However, some might argue that her method was unkind. But considering the context of his initial intrusion, her response could be seen as a valid reaction to his disrespect.\n"
