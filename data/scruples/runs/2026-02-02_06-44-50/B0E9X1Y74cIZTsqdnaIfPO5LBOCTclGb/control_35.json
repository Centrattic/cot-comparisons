Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong (AITA) after asking the guy how big his dick is in response to him asking her weight.\n\nFirst, the guy asked her how much she weighs, which made her uncomfortable. She then asked about his dick size. He didn't answer and got embarrassed. The guy's friends later called her an overreacting bitch because they thought she used his insecurity against him. The author is trying to figure out if she's the asshole here.\n\nSo, the key points are: mutual questions about personal attributes, the context of the conversation, and the reactions from both parties and their friends. \n\nAsking about weight can be sensitive, especially since it's often tied to body image issues. The guy's question might have been inappropriate, and the author felt uncomfortable. When he made a comment about her weight compared to his, that escalated things. She responded by asking about his dick size, which is also a personal and sensitive topic for many people. \n\nThe guy's friends argue that she took advantage of his insecurity. However, the author was trying to show him the double standard by reflecting his behavior. The guy didn't apologize, and his friends didn't support her. \n\nIn terms of social norms, both questions are personal, but the context matters. If the guy started by asking about her weight, which she found offensive, then her asking about his dick size is a form of pointing out the inconsistency. But some might see it as taking the situation too far. However, others might argue she was standing up for herself after being made uncomfortable. \n\nThe guy's response of not apologizing and the friends' judgment of her suggest that the dynamic was already tense. The author's action was an attempt to make him understand her perspective. \n\nConsidering all this, it's a situation where both parties have valid points. However, the initial question about weight was the catalyst. The author's response was a direct challenge to his behavior, which he found embarrassing. Whether it's justified depends on whose perspective you take. But since the question is about whether she's in the wrong, the answer hinges on whether her response was a fair reaction to his initial inappropriate question. \n\nIn many social contexts, pointing out double standards is a way to highlight unfair treatment. However, bringing up a sensitive topic like that could be seen as crossing a line. But given the context, she was responding to his actions. \n\nThe friends' reactions don't necessarily validate either side but show the social pressure on women to avoid such reactions. The author's friends might not understand the sensitivity around weight. \n\nOverall, the author's action was a form of self-advocacy after feeling disrespected. The guy's initial question was problematic, and her response, while personal, was an attempt to make him aware. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
