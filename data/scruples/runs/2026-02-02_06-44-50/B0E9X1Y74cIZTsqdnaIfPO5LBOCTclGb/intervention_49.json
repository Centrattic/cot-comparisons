Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is a bit complex. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the guy asked the author how much she weighed. The author felt uncomfortable with that question. Then the guy said he weighs less than her, which made her angry. She asked why he asked, and he defended himself, saying it's just a question and mentioning body image double standards. The author then retorted by asking about his dick size, which he found embarrassing. The friends later criticized her for overreacting and using his insecurity.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Hmm. Let me analyze. The guy asked a personal question about her weight. That's a sensitive topic and can be offensive. Then he made a comment about her weight being okay, which might be condescending. The author's response was to confront him with a personal question about his dick size. That seems like a direct retaliation, which could be seen as crossing the line. However, the guy's initial actions (asking about weight and making a comment) were probably inappropriate. \n\nBut the author's retort might have been a way to show him the double standard. However, using a personal and potentially offensive question in return could be considered the same behavior he criticized. The friends labeled her as the asshole because she used his insecurity against him. They might be right in that sense. She knew about his insecurity but used it to retaliate, which could be seen as manipulative. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy started the cycle by making her uncomfortable. The author had a right to feel offended and tried to make him see her perspective. But her method might have been inappropriate. The key here is whether her response was proportional and respectful. Asking about his genital size is a personal and sensitive question, similar to the one he asked. If the goal was to make him understand the discomfort of being asked such a question, then she mirrored his action, which might not be the best approach. But if she was trying to highlight the double standard, maybe it's a valid point. However, the execution might have been flawed. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's action was a form of retaliation. While the guy's initial behavior was wrong, her response could be seen as equally inappropriate. The friends' criticism might have merit because she used his insecurity in a way that's similar to how he used hers. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for responding in kind, even if the initial question was offensive. \n\nBut another angle is that she was trying to teach him a lesson, which could be a form of passive-aggressive communication. However, in public or in front of others, this might not be the best approach. The answer hinges on whether her response was a justified way to communicate her feelings or if it crossed the line into the same behavior she was objecting to. Given that the guy didn't apologize and the friends saw her as the problem, it's possible that her action, while understandable, was not the right approach. So, she might be in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
