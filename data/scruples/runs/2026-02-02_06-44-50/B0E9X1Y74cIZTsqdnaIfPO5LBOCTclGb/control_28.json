Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a guy asking the author about her weight, which made her uncomfortable, and then she asked him about his dick size in response. The guy didn't apologize, and her friends called her an asshole. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy asked her weight, which can be a sensitive topic. The author felt uncomfortable, which is valid because people have different sensitivities. She tried to handle it politely but then the guy made a comment about her weighing more than him, which she took as an insult. She questioned his motives, and he responded by saying she's part of a generation that's too sensitive and made a double standard argument about discrimination.\n\nThen she asked about his penis size, which he found embarrassing. The friends think she took advantage of his insecurity. The key here is whether her response was a fair retaliation or crossing a line.\n\nI think the guy initiated the sensitive conversation by asking her weight, which is a personal topic. The author's discomfort is reasonable. When he made the comment about her weight, it escalated the situation. She asked about his penis size as a way to show him how it felt to be asked a personal question. While using his known insecurity might be a bit of a low blow, her intention was to highlight the double standard he pointed out. \n\nHowever, asking about someone's penis size is also a personal and potentially hurtful question. Even if it's in the context of pointing out a double standard, it's a direct comparison. Friends labeled her as the asshole because they saw her using his insecurity against him. But the root issue is that the guy first asked a sensitive question and made her feel uncomfortable. His argument about double standards might be flawed, as weight and penis size are both sensitive topics, but that doesn't justify either party's behavior.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, maybe both acted inappropriately by bringing up sensitive topics. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. She was responding to his actions. If the guy started by making her feel uncomfortable, then her reaction, while perhaps not the best approach, was a reaction to his initial transgression. However, using his insecurity as a retort might be seen as manipulative. \n\nBut considering the context, the guy's comments about double standards and the fact that he didn't apologize, the author might have been trying to make a point. The friends' judgment is likely biased because they support the guy. So, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because the initial question was inappropriate, and her response was a reaction to that.\n"
