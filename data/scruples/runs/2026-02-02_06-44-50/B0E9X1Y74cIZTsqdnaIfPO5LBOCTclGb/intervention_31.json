Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy asking the author's weight, which made her uncomfortable. She then retaliated by asking about his penis size, leading to conflict and judgment from their friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy asked her weight, which she found personal and offensive. His comment about her weight being \"okay\" but implying she's not \"morbidly fat\" might have been harsh. However, weight is a sensitive topic, and his approach could have been inappropriate. The author felt she had to defend herself by bringing up his insecurity about his penis size, which he didn't appreciate. Her friends are now saying she overreacted by using his insecurity against him.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the guy did ask a personal question without considering her feelings. But when she responded by asking a similarly personal question, even if it was to highlight the double standard, it might have been crossing a line. He was embarrassed and didn't apologize, but she also didn't let it go. The friends' reaction is that she took advantage of his insecurity. \n\nThe key here is whether her response was a reasonable way to address the issue. Some might say she had a right to express her discomfort and point out the hypocrisy. Others might argue that using his insecurity to retaliate wasn't fair. It's a bit of a gray area. The guy's initial question was rude, but her response might have been equally so. However, the fact that he didn't apologize and she felt the need to confront him in that way... maybe she overstepped. But she also had a right to feel her question was valid. It's tricky. I'm leaning towards her not being in the wrong because he initiated the personal question, but her response might have been a poor choice. Wait, the user initially thought she was in the wrong. Hmm. I need to decide based on social norms and what's considered respectful. Asking someone's weight can be intrusive. Retaliating with a question about their penis size is also personal. Both actions are problematic, but maybe the guy's initial question was more egregious. However, her response escalated the situation. So maybe she's not in the wrong, but she could have handled it better. The friends' judgment might be harsh. So, the answer would be B: No, the author is not in the wrong. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, some might argue that both acted inappropriately. But the user wants a clear A or B. Given the dynamics of the situation, the guy's initial question was rude, and her response, while also personal, was in reaction to his behavior. So B seems appropriate.\n"
