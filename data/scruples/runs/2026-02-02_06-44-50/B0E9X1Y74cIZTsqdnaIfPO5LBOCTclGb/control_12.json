Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. So the user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the guy asked the author out on a date. At the end of the date, during small talk, he showed her a post about a weightlifter and commented on her weight. Then he asked the author how much she weighed. The author felt uncomfortable and answered, but then he made a comment about her weight compared to his. She got angry and asked why he asked, leading to a back-and-forth where he defended his question and criticized her sensitivity. She then asked about his penis size to illustrate the double standard, which embarrassed him. Afterward, his friends called her an overreacting bitch.\n\nSo the main issue here is whether the author was wrong for responding the way she did. Let's consider the key points. The guy asked a personal question about her weight, which she found offensive. She then asked a personal question about his penis size in return. He didn't like it, and his friends are criticizing her for using his insecurity against him.\n\nFrom a social norms perspective, asking about someone's weight can be a sensitive and potentially rude question. It's generally considered inappropriate to ask someone their weight, especially in a dating context, because it can touch on body image issues. The guy's question was out of bounds, and the author felt uncomfortable. \n\nWhen she asked about his penis size, that's also a personal and potentially sensitive question. However, she framed it as a way to show him the double standard. She used his insecurity to make a point about how his question made her feel. His friends are arguing that she took advantage of his insecurity, which complicates things. \n\nBut the initial question from the guy was the catalyst. He started by asking her weight, which she found offensive. Her response was a form of confrontation to highlight the double standard he was pointing out. While asking about penis size is also personal, it's a reciprocal action in response to his initial inappropriate question. \n\nThe guy didn't apologize and instead ranted about double standards, which suggests he was defensive. The author's actions were a way to make him understand her perspective. However, using someone's insecurity against them might be seen as manipulative, but given the context, it was a direct response to his behavior.\n\nIn terms of social norms, both questions are personal, but the guy started it. The author's reaction was in response to being made to feel uncomfortable and not receiving an apology. His friends' judgment of her is also part of the problem, as they're reinforcing his side without considering hers. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. The initial question was the issue, and her response was a valid attempt to address the double standard he was enforcing. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
