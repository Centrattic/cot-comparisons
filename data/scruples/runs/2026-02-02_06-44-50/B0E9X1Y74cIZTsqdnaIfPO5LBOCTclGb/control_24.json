Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me go through the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the guy asked the author how much she weighs. Weight can be a sensitive topic, and the author was uncomfortable. She responded, and he then made a comment that she weighs more than him. The author felt that was a jab at her weight, leading her to confront him. The guy defended himself by saying it's just a question and made a point about double standards regarding body image. Then the author asked him about his penis size, which made him embarrassed. The guy's friends labeled her as the asshole for using his insecurity against him.\n\nSo, the key points here: Did the author overreact? The initial question about weight was intrusive, and the guy's follow-up comment was hurtful. By asking about his penis size, the author tried to mirror his insecurity to show him her perspective. But his friends argue that she used his known insecurity, implying she's the one being unfair. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the guy initiated the personal question, which the author found offensive. His response was dismissive and even a bit derogatory. The author's retort was a direct response to his comment, using his insecurity to highlight the double standard. While it's a bit of a tit-for-tat, the initial fault might lie with the guy for bringing up weight in a way that made her uncomfortable. The friends' reaction seems to be about defending their friend's behavior, possibly ignoring his part in the conflict. \n\nHowever, the author's method of responding by asking about his penis size might not be the most constructive way to address the issue. But given that he was using weight as a point of comparison, her response could be seen as a way to illustrate the same kind of judgment applied to him. The key is whether the author overstepped. Since the guy started the conversation with a personal and potentially hurtful question, the author's reaction, while direct, is a response to his behavior. The friends' labeling her as the \"asshole\" seems misplaced because they're not considering his initial transgression. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for responding as she did. The guy's actions provoked the response, and the author was defending her feelings. The friends' judgment is more about maintaining their friend's image rather than assessing who was at fault. So, the author isn't the asshole here. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
