Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that a guy asked the author how much she weighs during a date. The author felt uncomfortable and then later asked the guy about his dick size to show him how it feels. The guy didn't like that and his friends called the author an overreacting bitch.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial question about weight. The guy asked her weight, and she found it personal and uncomfortable. That's a common issue because weight can be a sensitive topic, especially for women. The guy's response after she asked why he asked was pretty harsh, comparing it to how women are discriminated against for things they can't control, like height. That argument seems flawed because weight can be something people can control to some extent, and it's different from height, which is genetic. So the guy's reasoning is problematic, and maybe that's why the author felt justified in pushing back.\n\nThen the author asked him about his dick size as a way to show him how she felt. The guy was embarrassed and didn't respond, and his friends later criticized the author for taking advantage of his insecurity. The key question is whether the author's response was appropriate. Using someone else's vulnerability to teach a lesson can be seen as cruel, even if the initial question was inappropriate. The author could have explained her discomfort without reciprocating with a personal question, especially one as sensitive as that. So maybe the author went too far in her response, even if the guy's actions were wrong.\n\nHowever, the guy's behavior was also inappropriate. Asking someone's weight can be intrusive, and his justification about double standards doesn't hold up. The author's reaction might be a result of the guy's initial transgression. But the method she used to address it might have been unkind. So there's a bit of a back and forth here.\n\nBut according to the user's instruction, we need to answer A (author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. The main point is whether the author's action of asking about his dick size was justified. Even if the guy made her uncomfortable, using his insecurity against him might not be the right approach. It's possible that the author crossed a line by using his personal issue to make a point, which could be seen as bullying or exploiting his vulnerability. Therefore, even though the guy started it, the author's specific action of asking about his size might be where the wrongdoing occurred. So the answer might be A.\n"
