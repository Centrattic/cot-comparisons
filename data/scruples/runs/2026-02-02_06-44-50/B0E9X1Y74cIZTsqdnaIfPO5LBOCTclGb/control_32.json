Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. So, first, I need to understand the situation clearly.\n\nThe scenario is about a guy asking the author how much she weighs, which made her uncomfortable. She then responds by asking about his dick size in response. The guy didn't apologize, and her friends are calling her a bitch for it. The question is whether she was wrong to do that.\n\nFirst, let's look at the initial interaction. The guy asked about her weight, which she found intrusive. Weight is often a sensitive topic, especially for women, so his question could be seen as crossing a personal boundary. The author's discomfort is valid here. When he made a comment about her weighing more than him, that escalated things. His remark about her weight being okay but not morbidly fat still sounds judgmental and dismissive of her feelings.\n\nThen she asks about his dick size as a way to show him the harm in his question. This is a classic \"turning the question back\" tactic, which people often use to illustrate how personal and uncomfortable such inquiries can be. The guy became embarrassed and didn't apologize, which suggests he didn't take her point. His friends, however, are defending him, implying that she overreacted because she knew his insecurity and used it against him.\n\nNow, the key points here are about consent and mutual respect in personal questions. The guy didn't ask if it was okay to talk about her weight; he just asked. The author's response was a direct consequence to highlight the imbalance. However, some might argue that asking about his dick size is equally personal and could be seen as retaliating. But the context is important: she was trying to make a point about the discomfort he caused. \n\nIn terms of social norms, asking someone about their body in a way that makes them uncomfortable without consent is problematic. The guy's initial question was inappropriate, and the author's response, while perhaps not the most mature way to handle it, was a reaction to being made to feel uncomfortable. The friends' judgment that she's the asshole because she knew about his insecurity is a double standard. They're saying she shouldn't have done it because she knew it would hurt him, but they don't consider that he was the one who started with the personal question.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions were a reaction to the guy's breach of personal space. While her method might not be the best approach, the underlying issue is the guy's initial invasion of her privacy. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
