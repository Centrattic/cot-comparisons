Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking about the guy's dick size after he asked about her weight.\n\nFirst, the situation: The guy asked her weight, which made her uncomfortable. He then made a comment about her weight compared to his, which she found harsh. She responded by asking about his dick size, which he found embarrassing. Now, the friends are saying she overreacted.\n\nI need to consider social norms and mutual respect. Asking about someone's weight is a sensitive topic and can be seen as intrusive. The guy's comment about her weight being okay but not morbidly fat might come off as dismissive or judgmental. The author's response was to ask about his dick size, which is also a personal and potentially sensitive question.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was a proportionate and appropriate way to address the discomfort. By using his insecurity against him, she might have mirrored his behavior, which could be seen as hypocritical. Even if she was trying to make a point about the double standard, using a personal question in return might not be the best approach. It's possible that her action was meant to highlight the issue, but it could also be seen as taking advantage of his insecurity.\n\nThe friends' reaction suggests they view her as the one overstepping, which adds another layer. However, the initial question from the guy about her weight was inappropriate, which started the conflict. The author's response might not be in the wrong if she was trying to stand up for herself, but the method could be questionable.\n\nIn terms of social etiquette, both topics are private, and using one sensitive question to counter another might not be effective. It's important to address discomfort without retaliating in kind. The author might have been justified in feeling upset and trying to communicate her perspective, but the way she did it could be seen as unkind or unfair, especially if it was meant to shame him.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because her response was a personal attack rather than a respectful conversation. However, the initial question from him was also inappropriate, so there's nuance. But based on the friends' reactions and the standard of mutual respect, the author's actions might be viewed as crossing a line.\n"
