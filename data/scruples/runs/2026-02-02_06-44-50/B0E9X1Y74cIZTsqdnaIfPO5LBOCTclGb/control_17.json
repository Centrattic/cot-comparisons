Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe guy asked the author how much she weighs. She found that uncomfortable and later he made a comment about her weight compared to his. She got angry and asked why he asked, and he said it was just out of curiosity. Then he made a comment about her weight being \"ok\" and that she's not morbidly fat. She then asked him about his dick size, which made him embarrassed. His friends later called her an overreacting bitch for using his insecurity against him.\n\nFirst, I should consider the initial question about weight. Weight can be a sensitive topic, and asking someone how much they weigh can be intrusive. The guy's follow-up comment about her weight being \"ok\" but not morbidly fat sounds dismissive and possibly hurtful. He also brought up a double standard about insecurities, which might not be a valid comparison. \n\nThen the author responded by asking about his dick size, which is a personal question too. She used his insecurity to make him see her perspective. His friends are upset because she knew about his insecurity and used it against him, even though she had her own boundaries crossed.\n\nThe key points here are mutual sensitivity. The guy's question about weight was personal and made her uncomfortable. Her response was to ask a similarly personal question. But the context matters: she was trying to show him how his question made her feel. The friends are criticizing her for using his insecurity, but he was the one who first intruded on her personal space. \n\nIn terms of who's at fault, maybe both have some responsibility. However, the initial question from the guy was inappropriate, and his comments were hurtful. The author's response was a reaction to being made to feel uncomfortable. But asking about his dick size after he asked about her weight might be seen as using his insecurity in a way that's not fair. However, she was trying to make a point about how personal questions can be hurtful. \n\nThe friends' reaction is a bit of a red herring; their judgment doesn't necessarily determine who is right. The main issue is the exchange between the two. Since the guy's actions were the initial problem, and the author's response was a way to highlight the issue, she might not be in the wrong. However, some might argue that she escalated things by asking a personal question in return. But given that she was trying to show him her perspective, it's a form of empathy-building. \n\nSo considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The guy's initial question was the problem, and her response was a way to address the discomfort caused by his actions. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
