Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy asking the author about her weight, which made her uncomfortable. She then asked him about his dick size as a way to show him how his actions felt. The friends are saying she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy asked her weight, which she found personal and uncomfortable. He followed up with a comment that made her feel he was criticizing her weight. She confronted him, and he defended himself by bringing up a double standard. Then she used his own insecurity about his dick size to mirror his behavior. The friends are upset because she used his insecurity against him, even though he was the initial one to ask a personal question about her weight.\n\nSo, was the author wrong to ask about his dick size? Well, the guy asked a personal question that made her uncomfortable. She responded in kind, using his vulnerability to make a point. It's a form of reverse psychology or showing him how his actions affected her. But maybe the friends see it as taking advantage. However, the guy didn't apologize and continued to defend himself harshly. The author's action might be a way to highlight the double standard he pointed out. \n\nOn one hand, the guy initiated the personal question and made her feel judged. On the other, the author used his insecurity to teach him a lesson. While using someone's insecurity can be harsh, it's often a way to make them understand how it feels to be on the receiving end. The friends' reaction seems to be projecting the guy's behavior onto her, but they're not considering the context of how he treated her first.\n\nSo, considering the initial provocation and the lack of apology from the guy, the author's response might be justified as a form of self-defense in communication. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
