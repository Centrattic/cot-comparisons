Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy asking the author about her weight, which made her uncomfortable. She then asked him about his penis size in response, leading to conflict and judgment from their friend group.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key points. The guy asked about her weight, which she found personal and made her uncomfortable. He then made a comment about her weight compared to his own, which she interpreted as making her feel fat. She responded by asking about his penis size, which he found embarrassing, and the friend group criticized her for overreacting.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the guy was being intrusive with a sensitive topic, and she reciprocated with a question about his insecurity. The friend group's response is that she took advantage of his known insecurity. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my perspective.\n\nI need to consider social norms and what's appropriate. Asking someone about their weight can be intrusive and potentially hurtful, especially if the person is sensitive about it. However, the author's response of asking about his penis size might be seen as equally inappropriate, even if it's a reciprocal action. Reciprocating with a personal question in an argument might not be the best approach. It could escalate the situation and lead to embarrassment for both parties. Additionally, the friend group's criticism is that she used his known insecurity against him, which could be seen as taking advantage of a vulnerability.\n\nThe guy's comments about double standards and his own insecurities might not fully excuse his initial question, but they do provide context. However, his response to her discomfort by making a judgment about her weight is problematic. The author's main issue is that the question made her uncomfortable, and the guy didn't apologize, leading her to retaliate.\n\nIn terms of judgment, both parties might have overstepped. The guy asked a personal question inappropriately, and the author responded with a reciprocal question that was also personal. However, the friend group's response is more about defending the guy's actions, possibly because such topics are more socially accepted when men bring them up. The author's action might be seen as taking the conversation too far, even if her initial discomfort was valid.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's action of asking the penis size question as a form of retribution might be viewed as crossing a line, even if her initial discomfort was justified. It's possible that the author is in the wrong because she escalated the situation with a personal question, even if it was to make a point. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
