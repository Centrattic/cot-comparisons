Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a guy asked her how much she weighs, which made her uncomfortable. She then asked him about his dick size in response. Her friends are saying she's the asshole because they think she took advantage of his insecurity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around these kinds of questions. Weight is often considered a personal topic, and it's not uncommon for people to feel uncomfortable when asked. The guy's approach might have been insensitive, especially if he made a comment that implied she was overweight. But then, when she asked about his dick size, which is another sensitive topic, maybe that was crossing a line. \n\nThe key here is whether her response was a fair reaction. She felt it was a personal attack and tried to mirror his behavior to show the problem. However, using another person's insecurity in the same way they did might not be the best approach. It could come off as hypocritical, especially if the context isn't the same. Weight and body size are different from genital size, but both can be sensitive. \n\nAlso, the fact that the guy didn't apologize and that his friends are defending him might indicate that the social group has a different perspective. They see her as overreacting because she used his insecurity against him, even if he was wrong to bring up her weight. \n\nOn the other hand, if the guy was being rude and then she responded in kind, maybe she wasn't wrong to stand up for herself. But using the same tactic he used might not be effective and could be seen as equally problematic. \n\nI think the author's intention was to make him understand her discomfort by putting him in a similar position. However, this approach might not have been the best way to handle it. It's possible that her friends are right in seeing her as the asshole because she escalated the situation by bringing up a sensitive topic he was already insecure about. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is A: Yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
