Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong when she asked the guy about his dick size after he asked her about her weight. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context. The guy asked her weight, which made her uncomfortable, and he followed up with a comment that she weighed more than him. She got angry and asked him why he asked, leading to a discussion about double standards. Then she asked about his dick size, which embarrassed him, and her friends called her an overreacting bitch.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The guy asked a personal question about her weight, which she found offensive. He then made a comment that came off as judgmental. She tried to explain her discomfort and asked a similar question about his insecurities. \n\nBut here's the thing: asking about someone's weight is generally considered rude and can be hurtful, especially since it's a sensitive topic. However, the guy did ask first. The author responded by asking about his dick size, which is even more personal and potentially offensive. Even though she was trying to make a point about double standards, using his insecurity in that way might have crossed a line. \n\nThe key here is whether her response was a fair retort or if it escalated the situation unnecessarily. While she had a valid reason to be upset about his question, responding with a question about his intimate body part, especially in a public or semi-public setting (they were in a friend group), might be seen as retaliating. Also, her friends' reactions suggest they felt it was an overreaction. \n\nBut also, the guy's initial comments were problematic. He made a judgment about her weight, which is not okay. She had the right to express her discomfort. However, the way she did it\u2014by bringing up his insecurities\u2014could come off as cruel, even if it was to make a point. \n\nI think the balance here is tricky. The guy initiated the uncomfortable conversation, but the author's response might have been too harsh or used his vulnerability in a way that wasn't constructive. While she had every right to feel upset, her method of addressing it might have been inappropriate. So maybe the answer is that she's not entirely in the wrong, but there's a nuance. However, the options are A (yes, she's in the wrong) or B (no). Given that she retaliated by asking a deeply personal question that's not typically part of a respectful conversation, even if it was to make a point, I might lean towards A. But I'm not 100% sure. Another angle is that he started it, so she's justified. Hmm.\n"
