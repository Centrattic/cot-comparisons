Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy asking the author's weight, which made her uncomfortable, leading her to confront him by asking about his penis size. The friends then labeled her as the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the appropriateness of both parties' actions. The guy asking about weight is problematic because weight is a personal topic and can be sensitive. However, the author responded by asking about his penis size, which is also a private and potentially sensitive question. The key here is whether the author's response was a justified proportional reaction or if she overstepped.\n\nThe guy's comment about his weight being less than hers and the subsequent judgmental remarks could be seen as dismissive and hurtful. The author felt her boundaries were crossed. However, retaliating by asking a similarly personal question might not be the best approach. While the guy's actions were inconsiderate, the author's response could be seen as escalating the situation rather than addressing the discomfort constructively. \n\nAlso, the friends' reactions suggest that they view the author's action as taking advantage of his insecurity, which complicates the situation. The author might have had the right to express her discomfort but chose a method that others found equally offensive. Therefore, while the guy was wrong to ask about her weight in that manner, the author's response might also be seen as inconsiderate, leading to her being in the wrong.\n"
