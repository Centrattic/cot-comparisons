Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong after asking about the guy's dick size in response to him asking about her weight. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The guy asked her weight, which made her uncomfortable. Then he made a comment about her weight compared to his, which she found harsh. She responded by asking about his dick size, which he didn't appreciate, and others in the friend group think she's the asshole.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about mutual respect and boundaries. The guy asked a personal question that made her uncomfortable. She answered, but then he made a comment that came off as judgmental. She then used his insecurity to reciprocate by asking a personal question about his body, which he found inappropriate. \n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Well, he initiated by asking a sensitive question. However, her response was to escalate the situation by turning the question back at him. Even though she had a reason (his comment about her weight), using his insecurity as a defense might not be the best approach. It's about how both parties handled the situation. He shouldn't have asked about her weight in a way that made her feel judged, and she shouldn't have used his insecurity to retaliate. \n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong. The friend group's reaction is also a factor. They think she overstepped because she knew his insecurity. So, even if he started it, her response might have been an overreaction. However, she was defending her boundaries. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think both are at fault to some extent. The guy shouldn't have made the comment about her weight, and she shouldn't have turned it into a personal attack on his insecurity. But the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. Considering the social norms, asking about someone's body size can be seen as crossing a line, especially if it's in retaliation. So maybe the answer is A (Yes, she's in the wrong), but I'm a bit conflicted. Alternatively, maybe B (No), because he started it. Hmm.\n"
