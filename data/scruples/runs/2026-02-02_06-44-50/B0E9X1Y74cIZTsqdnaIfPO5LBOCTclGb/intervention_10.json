Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the author (the person telling the story) is in the wrong. The situation involves a date where the guy asked the woman about her weight, which made her uncomfortable. She then asked him about his dick size in response. The guy's friends are upset with her, saying she's overreacting and using his insecurity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of personal questions and how they can affect people differently. The guy asked about her weight, which is a sensitive topic for her. She felt uncomfortable and then asked him about his dick size. The guy reacted with embarrassment and didn't apologize. His friends are on his side, saying she took advantage of his insecurity.\n\nI should think about the social norms around body size questions. Both weight and dick size are personal topics, and it's generally considered rude to ask someone about their body dimensions. However, the context matters. The guy's question about her weight was probably inappropriate, and her response might be seen as retaliating. But she tried to make him understand her discomfort by asking a similar question that he's insecure about.\n\nThe key points here: Did the author overstep by asking about his dick size as a response to his question? Is there a double standard in how these questions are perceived? The guy's friends argue that she knew his insecurity and used it to shame him. On the other hand, the author might feel she was standing up for herself after being made uncomfortable.\n\nI need to consider if her response was justified. If someone asks a personal question that makes you uncomfortable, responding in kind can be a way to show how the question affected you. However, it's possible that her approach was confrontational and not the best way to communicate her feelings. The guy might not have realized how his question was hurtful, but she could have addressed it without using a personal question in return.\n\nAlso, the guy's defensiveness and his argument about double standards might indicate a lack of empathy. He was insecure about his own body and then criticized her for being sensitive. The author's friends think she's at fault for using his insecurity, but she might have been trying to illustrate the problem with his question by mirroring it.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit gray. Both parties could have handled it better. However, the user believes the author is in the wrong, so I need to weigh whether her response was an acceptable way to show him how his question affected her or if it crossed a line. Given that the guy's friends are upset and she used his insecurity to make a point, maybe the author did overstep, even if her intention was to teach a lesson. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong), but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if her actions were a justified response to his initial question.\n"
