Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B) based on the described situation. \n\nFirst, the guy asked the woman how much she weighs. Weight is a sensitive topic for many people, and the woman felt uncomfortable. She responded with surprise and then answered after hesitating. The guy then made a comment about her weighing more than him, which she found offensive. She asked him about the point of the question, and he defended himself by saying it's just a question and brought up a double standard regarding insecurities. \n\nThen, when the woman tried to show him her perspective by asking about his dick size, he was embarrassed and didn't respond. The friends later called her an overreacting bitch because she knew his insecurity and used it.\n\nSo, the key points are: the guy asked a personal question that made her uncomfortable, and she retaliated by asking a similarly personal question about him, which he found embarrassing. The friends think she's wrong because she used his insecurity against him.\n\nNow, considering social norms and mutual respect. Asking someone's weight can be intrusive, especially if it's done in a context that's perceived as judgmental. The guy's comment about her weighing more than him and the subsequent back-and-forth suggests he was being insensitive. However, the woman's response of asking about his dick size was a direct retaliation. While she had a right to express her discomfort, using a personal question as a counter could be seen as crossing the line, especially since the guy didn't want to answer and she continued. \n\nThe friends' criticism is that she took advantage of his insecurity. Even if she was justified in feeling hurt, her response might have been overly aggressive. The question is whether her reaction was proportionate. In many social settings, responding to a personal question with another personal question, especially one that's typically considered very private (like penis size), can be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy started by asking about her weight, which he might not realize is a sensitive topic. She could have set a boundary by saying she didn't feel comfortable sharing. Instead, she shared, and then felt the need to confront him, which led to the conflict. Her action of asking about his dick size was her way of showing him how it felt, but it might have been an overreaction. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The guy's initial question was inappropriate, but her retaliation was also crossing a line. The friends' perception that she took advantage of his insecurity might be valid. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because her response was an overreach, even if the guy's question was the initial issue. However, there's a case for B (not in the wrong) because she was responding to his insensitivity. But balancing both sides, the retaliation is more problematic. So, likely answer A.\n"
