Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy asking about her weight, which made her uncomfortable, and she then asked him about his dick size as a way to show him her perspective. The friends are saying she's the asshole because she knew he was insecure about that.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The guy asked her weight, which is a sensitive topic. She felt uncomfortable and responded by pointing out that his comment was harsh. Then, when he tried to defend himself and made a point about double standards, she used his insecurity to ask about his penis size. The friends argue that she used his insecurity against him, which is why she's the one at fault.\n\nFrom a social norms perspective, asking someone about their weight can be seen as intrusive. It's often considered a personal topic and can be triggering. The guy's follow-up comments about her not being morbidly fat might have been meant to be reassuring, but the way he phrased it could come off as dismissive or even critical. She then took the offensive by asking him about his size, which is another sensitive topic. Using his insecurity against him in a way that humiliated him might be crossing a line, even if it was to make a point about the double standard.\n\nBut she was trying to show him her perspective. However, the method she used might not be appropriate. Instead of responding with another personal question, maybe she could have explained her feelings without retaliating. The friends' reaction is that she overstepped because she knew his insecurity. Even if he initiated the topic, her response was a different level of personal invasion. \n\nOn the other hand, he started by asking her weight, which is already a personal question. She was within her rights to feel uncomfortable and to address it. But the way she addressed it by asking about his size might have been a poor choice. She could have stood up for herself without reciprocating with another sensitive question. The key point here is about mutual respect and how to handle sensitive topics without escalating the situation through personal attacks. \n\nSo, considering that she used his insecurity to make a point but in a way that caused him embarrassment, and given that both topics are sensitive, it's possible that she did overstep. The friends' criticism might be valid in that she used his vulnerability against him, even if her intention was to highlight the double standard. Therefore, the answer might lean towards her being in the wrong (A), but there's also a case to be made that he started it. However, the act of using his insecurity in a way that's hurtful is where she might have gone too far.\n"
