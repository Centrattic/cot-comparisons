Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the guy asked the author her weight, which made her uncomfortable. She responded, and then he made a comment that she interpreted as her being fat. She got angry and asked why he asked, leading to a discussion where he defended his question and brought up double standards. She then asked him about his penis size to illustrate the double standard, which embarrassed him. His friends later called her an \"overreacting bitch\" because she used his insecurity against him.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The guy asked a personal question that she found offensive. She had a right to feel uncomfortable and to express that. However, her response was to ask him a personal question about his anatomy, which he found embarrassing. His friends' reaction is that she took advantage of his insecurity.\n\nIn terms of social norms, asking about weight can be sensitive and intrusive. The guy's justification about a double standard doesn't excuse the question. However, the author's retort might have been a way to point out the hypocrisy, but it could be seen as unfair because she used his insecurity to make her point. It's possible that while his question was wrong, her response crossed a line by using his vulnerability.\n\nBut considering that she was trying to make him understand her perspective by mirroring his behavior, it's a form of pointing out the double standard. However, sometimes people react to being called out in a hurtful way, even if they had it coming. The key is whether her action was a proportionate response. Since she stopped after he asked her to, maybe it wasn't malicious. The friends' judgment of her as the asshole might be due to their own biases.\n\nIn conclusion, the guy's initial question was wrong, and the author had the right to respond. Her asking about his anatomy was a way to highlight the double standard, but it might have been too direct. However, given the context and her intent to make him see her perspective, it's a nuanced situation. She might not be in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
