Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy asking the author about her weight, which made her uncomfortable. She responded by asking about his penis size, and he got embarrassed. Now, his friends are calling her an asshole, but she's unsure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The guy asked about her weight, which is a sensitive topic. The author felt uncomfortable but answered because she didn't want to make him feel bad. Then he made a comment about her weight compared to his, which she found offensive. In response, she asked about his penis size, which is a personal and potentially embarrassing question for him. The guy didn't answer and became embarrassed, and the author's friends think she overreacted.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and boundaries. Asking someone about their weight can be intrusive, especially since weight is often a sensitive issue. The guy's comment about her weight being \"ok\" but not morbidly fat is dismissive and could be seen as minimizing her feelings. However, the author's response of asking about his penis size is a direct challenge to his insecurity, which she knows about. While she was trying to make him see her perspective, using his insecurity against him might not be the best approach. It's a tit-for-tat strategy that could be perceived as mean-spirited, even if she had her reasons. Additionally, the guy's friends' backlash might stem from the idea that she used his insecurity to make a point, which they see as exploiting him.\n\nHowever, the initial question about weight was the catalyst. The author's discomfort was valid, and she had a right to express it. The guy's comments about the double standard between height and weight are problematic and show a lack of empathy. But the author's method of responding by turning the question back on him might have been a mistake. It's possible she crossed a line by using his insecurity as a retort, even if she was trying to highlight the unfairness of personal questions.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while both weight and genital size are sensitive topics, the way the author used his insecurity against him might have been more hurtful than necessary. The guy didn't apologize, but his friends' reactions suggest that the author's approach was seen as overstepping. The question is whether her response was justified. If she was trying to make a point about mutual respect, but did so in a way that was hurtful, then she might be at fault. Alternatively, if the guy's initial comments were the real issue, then her response could be seen as a justified attempt to assert her boundaries.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions do cross into a gray area. While she had valid reasons to feel uncomfortable, using his insecurity against him might not be the best way to address the issue. It could be seen as escalating the situation unnecessarily. Therefore, the author might be partially at fault. However, the guy's initial comments and the double standard he mentioned also contribute to the problem. But given the social context and the friends' reactions, the author's method of response might be considered in the wrong.\n"
