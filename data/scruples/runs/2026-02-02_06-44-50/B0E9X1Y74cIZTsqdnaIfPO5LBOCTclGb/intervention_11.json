Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy asking the author about her weight, which she found uncomfortable. She then retaliates by asking about his penis size, leading to conflict and criticism from their friend group.\n\nFirst, the guy asked about her weight, which is a sensitive topic. The author felt it was a personal question and didn't like how it was framed. She responded by asking about his penis size, using his known insecurity. The friends criticized her for exploiting his insecurity, but she argued she was showing him the issue with his behavior.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The guy's question about weight was intrusive and potentially hurtful. The author had the right to express her discomfort. However, her response by asking about his penis size might be seen as using his vulnerability against him, even if it was to make a point. The friends' reactions suggest they saw her as overreacting and taking advantage of his insecurity. \n\nOn one hand, the guy shouldn't have made a personal comment about her weight. On the other, the author's retaliation, while perhaps well-intentioned, might be seen as hypocritical or manipulative. The question is whether her response was a valid form of teaching a lesson or crossing a boundary.\n\nThe friends' judgment of her as an \"asshole\" is based on her using his insecurity to make a point, even if she thought it was justified. The key here is the approach she took. Directly confronting the issue respectfully might have been better than a tit-for-tat approach. \n\nIn terms of ethics, while the guy was in the wrong to ask about her weight, the author's response might have been an overreaction that didn't address the root issue constructively. The intent was to show him the problem, but the method could have been more considerate. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility for the conflict escalation. So, the answer could lean towards her being in the wrong.\n"
