Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote that story (the author) is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the guy asked the author how much she weighs. The author felt uncomfortable because weight can be a sensitive topic. She answered, and then the guy made a comment about her weighing more than him. She got upset and asked why he asked, and he justified it by saying he was just curious and even made a comment about her weight being okay. She then asked him about his penis size to show her perspective, which made him embarrassed. After that, she got messages from his friends calling her an overreacting bitch because she used his insecurity against him.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the guy asked a question that made her uncomfortable. It's true that weight is a personal topic, and some people don't appreciate others bringing it up, especially in a way that could be perceived as judgmental. The guy's comment about her weight being \"ok\" might have come off as dismissive or hurtful. The author's response was to mirror the question back by asking about his penis size, which is also a personal and sensitive topic. Using his insecurity against him could be seen as unfair, especially since he didn't know about her sensitivity regarding weight. The friends' reaction suggests that they view her as in the wrong because she used his vulnerability, even if he wasn't aware of hers.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy initiated the conversation about weight, which led to the uncomfortable exchange. The author's intention was to show him her perspective by asking a similar question. However, the problem is that she used his insecurity in a way that he wasn't expecting, which might have been a form of emotional manipulation. The key here is whether her response was an appropriate way to communicate her feelings.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while both weight and penis size are sensitive topics, the context matters. The guy's question might have been intrusive, and the author's response, while perhaps intended to highlight the double standard, might have been a bit of a low blow since he was unaware of her sensitivity. The friends' criticism might stem from the idea that she took advantage of his known insecurity without considering that he didn't know about her own.\n\nBut then again, the guy's approach was problematic. He asked a personal question and then made a comment that hurt her feelings. She then tried to explain her discomfort but was met with defensiveness. Her asking about his penis size was a way to mirror the experience, but maybe not the most constructive way. It's possible that she overreacted in the moment, but it's also a reaction to his previous actions.\n\nI think the author's actions were a form of retaliation rather than a constructive response. She used his insecurity to make a point, which could be seen as unfair since he wasn't aware of her own. The friends' perspective is valid in that she took advantage of a situation where he was vulnerable, even if her intention was to highlight his behavior. However, his initial question and comments were also inappropriate, so there's fault on both sides.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If we consider that she used his known insecurity without considering that he didn't know about her sensitivity, then maybe she is. However, her motivation was to show him the impact of his words. It's a bit of a gray area. In the end, the answer might depend on whether her action was a justified response to his behavior or an overstep.\n"
