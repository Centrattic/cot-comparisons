Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy asking her weight and then making comments about it, leading her to ask him about his dick size. The friends are saying she's the asshole because she used his insecurity against him.\n\nFirst, I need to assess who started the problematic behavior. The guy asked her weight, which she found uncomfortable. Weight is a sensitive topic, and even if it's a simple question, it can make someone feel judged. Then he made a comment about her weight compared to his, which sounds like a backhanded compliment. That's where the issue arises because even if he didn't mean to be hurtful, his words came off harsh. \n\nShe responded by confronting him about the question and then asked about his dick size as a way to show him her perspective. Her friends think she's in the wrong because she used his insecurity. But the key here is whether his initial actions were inappropriate. Asking someone's weight can be seen as intrusive, especially if it's done in a way that makes them uncomfortable. His comment about her weight not being morbidly fat adds to the problem because it's a comparison that's hurtful.\n\nHer asking about his size was a direct response to his behavior, trying to mirror his actions to make a point. It's a form of showing him how his actions felt to her. While it might come off as using his insecurity, the root issue is his initial inappropriate question. \n\nSo, the guy's actions started the conflict. The author had the right to express her discomfort and used a reciprocal method to make her point. Her friends' judgment might not fully understand the context of his initial behavior. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
