Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy asking the author about her weight, which made her uncomfortable, and then she retaliated by asking about his dick size. The guy didn't apologize, and his friends are now calling her an asshole because she used his insecurity.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The guy's question about her weight was personal and possibly inappropriate. Weight can be a sensitive topic, and asking someone how much they weigh without a clear reason might be considered intrusive. The author felt uncomfortable and tried to handle it without confrontation, which some might see as being accommodating. However, when he made a comment about her weight compared to his own, it crossed a line. His justification about being curious and his subsequent rant about double standards complicates things.\n\nThen, the author's response was to ask about his dick size. This is also a personal question, especially since the guy is known to be insecure about it. By doing this, she's using his vulnerability as a counterpoint to his comment. While it might have been an attempt to show him how personal his question was, the method could be seen as manipulative. She didn't apologize for her question and continued despite his discomfort, which could be seen as retaliating rather than addressing the issue constructively.\n\nThe friends' reactions are also a factor. They argue that she knew about his insecurity and used it to her advantage, which implies a lack of empathy or fairness. It's important to consider if her response was a proportionate defense of her boundary or if it was an unfair strike. \n\nOn one hand, the guy initiated by asking a personal question that made her uncomfortable. On the other, her response might have been an overreaction or a way to shame him for his own behavior. The line between standing up for oneself and being confrontational can be blurry here. \n\nIn terms of social norms, both weight and body size can be sensitive topics. The guy's approach was inconsiderate, but the author's method of addressing it by reciprocating with a similarly personal question might not be the best approach. It could be seen as an escalation of the conflict rather than a resolution. \n\nConsidering all this, the author might be at fault for using a personal attack rather than addressing the issue directly and respectfully. However, the guy's initial question was also inappropriate. The key is whether her response was justified. If the goal was to make him understand her perspective, using his insecurity as a weapon might not be fair, especially if it's not a direct parallel. Weight and body size are different from other aspects, but both can be deeply personal. \n\nThe friends' criticism that she took advantage of his insecurity suggests that her method was flawed. Even if her intent was to teach a lesson, the approach might have been disrespectful. The author's decision to ask about his dick size could be seen as a tit-for-tat that's not fair, given that the original question was about weight, which is a different category. \n\nIn conclusion, while the guy's actions were wrong, the author's response might have been an inconsiderate way to address it, leading to her being labeled the asshole by her friends. So, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong), but there are nuances. However, the main point is whether her response was appropriate. Since she used his insecurity to retaliate, even if with a point, it's possible she's in the wrong.\n"
