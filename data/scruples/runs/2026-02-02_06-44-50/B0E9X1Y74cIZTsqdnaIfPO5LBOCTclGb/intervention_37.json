Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy asking the author about her weight, which made her uncomfortable. She then retaliated by asking about his penis size, leading to mixed reactions from their friends.\n\nFirst, the guy asked about her weight, which the author found personal and offensive. He justified it by comparing it to how men might be judged on things they can't control, like height. The author's response was to ask about his penis size, which is a very personal question. Even though she did this to show him her perspective, it's a sensitive topic and can be seen as retaliating. The guy felt embarrassed and didn't apologize, but the friends sided against her, calling her overreacting. \n\nThe key points here are mutual insecurity and the line between a fair question and a personal attack. While the guy's question about weight was inappropriate, the author's response with a similarly personal question about his body might be seen as going too far. The friends' reactions suggest they view her as the aggressor because she used his insecurity against him. Even if her intention was to teach him a lesson, the method was confrontational. \n\nHowever, the guy did start the conversation with a personal question, so there's some initiation of the uncomfortable topic. But the author's retaliation might have been excessive. It's a bit of a grey area, but generally, asking someone about their penis size in a public or even private setting is not considered appropriate, especially as a direct response to being asked about weight. The friends' judgment of her as the asshole might be harsh, but her action could be seen as the wrong move. So, leaning towards her being in the wrong.\n"
