Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after asking a guy about his dick size following him asking about her weight.\n\nFirst, the guy asked her weight, which she found uncomfortable. She answered, and then he made a comment about her weight. She felt he was being judgmental, so she confronted him. He defended himself by saying it was just a question and brought up a double standard about how women are sensitive about weight but men aren't about dick size. She then asked him about his dick size to show him his own insecurity, which made him embarrassed. His friends called her an overreacting bitch because she used his insecurity against him.\n\nSo, the key points here: the guy asked a personal question that made her uncomfortable. She responded by asking a similarly personal question about his insecurity. The friends think she's the asshole because she used his weakness against him. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, he initiated the personal question, and she was trying to highlight the double standard he was pointing out. He was already making her feel judged, so her retaliation was a way to show him how his behavior felt to her. However, some might argue that using his insecurity was unfair. But considering the context, she was reacting to his comments and trying to make him see her perspective. His friends are probably biased in his favor.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. She was defending her feelings and pointing out the hypocrisy he mentioned. He brought up the double standard, and she used that to make a point. So the answer is B.\n"
