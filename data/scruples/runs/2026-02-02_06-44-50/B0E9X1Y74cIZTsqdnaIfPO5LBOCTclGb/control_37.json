Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the guy asked her how much she weighs after she commented on a weightlifting post. She was uncomfortable because weight can be a sensitive topic. She answered, and then he made a comment that made her feel like he was calling her fat. She got angry and asked why he asked, and he said it was just curiosity, but his tone was harsh. She then asked him about his dick size to show him how it feels to be asked something personal, which made him embarrassed. His friends are now calling her an overreacting bitch.\n\nFirst, the guy asked a personal question about her weight, which she found uncomfortable. That's a red flag. People should be aware that weight is a sensitive topic for many. He then made a comment that came off as judgmental. His response when she confronted him was dismissive, calling her sensitive and bringing up a double standard about discrimination. That's not a good way to handle criticism. Then, when she asked about his insecurities (dick size) to mirror his behavior, he didn't apologize, and his friends are blaming her for using his insecurity against him.\n\nThe key points here are consent and respect. Asking someone's weight without them being comfortable is inappropriate. The guy's reaction was dismissive and hurtful. The author's response might be seen as retaliatory, but only because she felt her boundary was violated. She tried to make him understand how his actions affected her. However, using his own insecurity against him could be seen as crossing a line, even if it was to make a point. The friends' judgment is also problematic because they're taking his side without understanding her perspective.\n\nSo, the guy definitely overstepped by asking about her weight in a way that made her uncomfortable and then being defensive. The author's reaction was a way to show him how his actions felt, which is a form of empathy, but maybe the method was a bit harsh. However, the main issue was his initial behavior. The friends are wrong to label her as the asshole because he was the one who started it. So, the author isn't in the wrong because she was defending her boundaries. The answer is B.\n"
