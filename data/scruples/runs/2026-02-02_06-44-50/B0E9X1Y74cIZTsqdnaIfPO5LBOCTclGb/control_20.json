Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described. Let me start by breaking down the key points.\n\nFirst, the guy asked the author how much she weighs. Weight can be a sensitive topic, and the author felt uncomfortable. She didn't want to make him feel bad for asking, so she answered. Then he made a comment that she weighs more than him, which she took as an insult. She asked why he asked, and he justified it by saying she's an okay weight but not morbidly fat. The author then confronted him by asking about his penis size, which he was insecure about, as teased by their friends. He got embarrassed and didn't respond. He didn't apologize, and their friends called the author an overreacting bitch.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user wants a judgment based on the details provided. So, let's analyze both sides.\n\nOn the author's side: The guy initiated a personal question about her weight, which made her uncomfortable. She responded but then felt his comment was harsh. She tried to show him her perspective by asking a personal question about his penis size. She didn't want to escalate but wanted him to understand her feelings.\n\nOn the guy's side: He asked a question he perceived as neutral (weight), which he was interested in because of the context of weightlifting. He didn't realize it was making her uncomfortable. He thought commenting on her weight was acceptable since he considered her \"okay\" and not fat. He felt his question was just curiosity.\n\nThe friends criticized the author for using his insecurity about his penis size to make a point. They argue that since she knew about his insecurity, she took advantage. But the author's intention was to make him understand her perspective on being asked a personal question that made her uncomfortable.\n\nNow, considering social norms and respect. Asking someone's weight is generally considered a personal invasion. While it's a question, it's often seen as inappropriate. The guy's comment about her weighing more than him could be interpreted as a put-down, even if that wasn't his intent. The author's response was to mirror the same kind of personal question he asked. The friends might see this as hypocritical, but her intent was to highlight the discomfort of being asked such a question.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The guy shouldn't have asked such a personal question, and the author's reaction was a way to show how she felt. However, using his insecurity against him might not be the best approach, but it's a reaction to his inconsiderate question. The friends' judgment of her as the asshole seems harsh because they don't consider the initial transgression he made.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The guy started it by asking a personal question, and she was defending her boundaries. Her response, while maybe not perfect, was a way to make him see her perspective. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
