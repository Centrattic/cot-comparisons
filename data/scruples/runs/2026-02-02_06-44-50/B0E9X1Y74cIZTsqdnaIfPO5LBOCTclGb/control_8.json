Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for responding to a guy's question about her weight by asking about his penis size. \n\nFirst, the guy asked her weight, which she found uncomfortable. He then made a comment about her weight compared to his, which she perceived as harsh. She confronted him, and he defended his actions, bringing up a double standard regarding insecurity. The author then used his known insecurity about his penis size to mirror his question back at him, which embarrassed him. Now, her friends are calling her an asshole for taking advantage of his insecurity.\n\nI need to consider the social norms here. Asking about weight can be sensitive, especially for women, due to societal pressures. The guy's comment about her weight being \"ok\" but not morbidly fat might have been intended to be reassuring, but it came off as judgmental. The author's response of asking about his penis size is a form of reverse psychology to make him understand her discomfort. \n\nIs this fair? Well, the guy brought up a personal topic, and she reciprocated with another personal topic that he's insecure about. However, the friends' reactions suggest that they see this as taking advantage. But the author's intent was to highlight the double standard, not to humiliate. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the guy initiated the personal question, which was inappropriate. The author's response, while confrontational, was a way to show him the impact of his words. It's a form of empathy-building. However, some might argue that using someone's insecurity in return isn't the best approach, but given the context, it's a valid attempt to communicate her feelings. \n\nThe key point is that initiating the personal question was the first wrong, and the author's response was a reaction to that. So, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
