Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the question) is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy asking the author how much she weighs, which made her uncomfortable. She responds by asking him about his dick size to highlight the double standard he mentioned. The friends then call her an asshole for using his insecurity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the conversation. The guy asked her weight, which she found personal and uncomfortable. He then made a comment that she felt was dismissive and harsh. She asked him why he asked, and he defended his actions. She used his known insecurity about his body (dick size) to mirror his behavior, pointing out the inconsistency. The friends argue she overreacted by exploiting his insecurity, even though he didn't know hers.\n\nKey points:\n- The guy asked a personal question that made her uncomfortable. Weight is often a sensitive topic, even if it's a \"just a question\" defense.\n- He then made a comment that she interpreted as judgmental, which escalated her discomfort.\n- She responded by asking about his dick size to mirror his behavior, using his own double standard argument against him.\n- The friends criticized her for this, saying she knew his insecurities and used them.\n\nThe question is whether her reaction was justified. The author's intent was to show the double standard he pointed out, which he had just discussed. By asking about his size, she's highlighting that if he can ask about weight, why can't she reciprocate about something he's insecure about. However, some might see this as using his vulnerability to make a point, even if it's in response to his actions.\n\nBut, in the context of the conversation, she was reacting to his previous behavior. He started by asking a personal question, then justified it, and she used his own argument to point out the inconsistency. The friends' reaction suggests they see it as exploitation, but the author's action was a direct response to his behavior. \n\nThe line here is whether her response was a fair challenge to his double standard or if it crossed into using his insecurities. Since she was trying to mirror his actions and highlight the hypocrisy, it seems like a form of non-violent confrontation to address the issue he raised. However, some might argue that it's not appropriate to bring up another person's insecurities, even if they're known.\n\nBut considering that he brought up weight, and she asked about size in response to his argument about double standards, her action was a direct and proportional response. The friends' judgment that she's the asshole might be due to societal norms where women are expected to be more accommodating, but the author's actions were in self-defense against a personal attack.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong), as she was responding to his behavior and using his own logic against him. However, there's a nuance here that could depend on context. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described, and her actions were a direct response to his behavior and the double standard he mentioned, the answer leans towards B.\n"
