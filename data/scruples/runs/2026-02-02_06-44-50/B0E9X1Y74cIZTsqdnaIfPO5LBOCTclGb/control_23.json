Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy asking about the author's weight, which made her uncomfortable, and then she asked him about his dick size in response. The guy didn't like that, and her friends are now calling her an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The guy asked her weight, which she found uncomfortable. She answered but felt he was being judgmental when he said she weighed more than him. She challenged him about the question's intent, he defended himself and made some comments about double standards. She then asked about his dick size, which he found embarrassing. The friends are upset that she used his insecurity against him.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the actions and motivations.\n\n1. **Asking about Weight**: Weight can be a sensitive topic. The guy initiated it by asking her weight, which she found intrusive. She responded, but felt his follow-up comments were harsh. The fact that he made a comment about her weight being okay but not morbidly fat might sound backhanded. Her discomfort is valid here.\n\n2. **Her Response**: She asked about his dick size as a way to show him the perspective of being asked a personal question. The guy is insecure about that, so she used it to mirror his behavior. But the friends argue that she knew his insecurity and used it to retaliate, which they see as unfair.\n\n3. **Double Standards**: The guy argued that there's a double standard\u2014why can't men comment on women's weights if women can comment on men's size? But the author's point is that the contexts are different. Weight is a topic that people can control (to some extent), whereas height or other physical traits may be seen as less controllable. However, this is a common debate, and the guy's argument might be simplistic.\n\n4. **Intent and Impact**: The author's intent was to make him understand how his question felt. The impact was that it embarrassed him, and her friends saw it as exploiting his insecurity. The question is whether using his insecurity was justified. \n\nIn terms of social norms, asking someone about their body size (weight or otherwise) can be seen as personal and inappropriate without consent. The guy initiated the sensitive question, and the author's response was a form of reciprocation. However, the friends' reaction is that she took advantage of his known insecurity. The key here is whether the author overstepped by asking about his dick size, especially knowing he's insecure about it.\n\nThe author's actions were a reaction to being made uncomfortable. However, using the same tactic he used (asking a personal question) might be seen as equalizing the situation. But some might argue that she crossed a line by targeting his insecurity, which he didn't ask about. The guy's friends are critical because they see it as using his vulnerability to make a point, which could be seen as manipulative or cruel.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers both intent and impact. The author's intent was to communicate her feelings, but the impact caused embarrassment to him and led to her being labeled as the asshole by his friends. However, the initial question from the guy was also inappropriate. \n\nThe author might not be entirely in the wrong because she had a right to express her discomfort. However, using a personal question about his insecurity might have been a harsh response. It's a gray area, but the key is whether her actions were proportionate. Since the guy started the personal inquiry, and she used the same approach to show him the harm, some might side with her. Others might think she should have addressed it without reciprocating the personal question.\n\nConsidering all factors, the answer might hinge on whether reciprocating with a question about his insecurity was the right approach. The friends see it as exploiting, but the author saw it as a way to highlight the issue. In AITA contexts, actions that use someone's known vulnerabilities can be seen as the asshole behavior because they can be hurtful even if intended to make a point. Therefore, the author might be considered in the wrong (A), but it's close.\n"
