Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy asking the author about her weight after she was uncomfortable with it. Then, when he made a comment about her weight being more than his, she asked him about his dick size to mirror his insecurities. The guy didn't take it well, and her friends called her an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The guy asked a personal question about her weight, which she found uncomfortable. He justified it by saying it was just a question, and then made a comment that she found insensitive. She responded by asking about his dick size, which he found embarrassing. The friends think she took advantage of his insecurity.\n\nThe author's actions: She was hurt by his comment and tried to show him the difference in how personal certain questions are perceived. However, using a physical trait (dick size) as a parallel to weight, which he found uncomfortable, might not be the most effective approach. It could be seen as using his insecurity against him, even if her intention was to highlight the double standard.\n\nThe guy's actions: He asked a sensitive question and made a comment that came off as judgmental. His defense about double standards is a bit of a stretch because weight is a personal topic that people can control (to some extent), unlike height, which is not. His rant about double standards might not hold up, but that doesn't mean the author's response was justified.\n\nConsidering the response: The author's friends are upset because she used his insecurity against him. Even if her intention was to make a point, the method could be seen as retaliatory and not fair. The question is whether she overstepped by bringing up his body in a way that was personal to him, especially when he didn't want to answer. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a tricky balance. She had a right to feel uncomfortable and to express that. However, her method of retort might have been inappropriate. The key is whether her response was a reasonable way to address the issue or if it crossed into using his insecurity against him. The friends' reaction might be harsh, but the author's action could be seen as taking the interaction too far. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (she is in the wrong), but I need to be careful here. Alternatively, considering that she was responding to his initial inappropriate question, maybe she's not in the wrong. But given that she didn't apologize and used his insecurity, maybe she is. Hmm.\n"
