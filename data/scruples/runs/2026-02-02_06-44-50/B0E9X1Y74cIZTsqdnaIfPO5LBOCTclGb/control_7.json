Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy asking the woman about her weight, which made her uncomfortable. She then responded by asking about his dick size when he mentioned his insecurities. Her friends are calling her the asshole because she used his insecurity against him, even though he didn't apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The guy asked a personal question about her weight, which she found offensive, especially since he followed up with a comment that made her feel judged. His justification was that weight is something people can control, unlike height, which he's insecure about. She countered by asking about his penis size, which he found embarrassing and didn't respond to. Her friends argue that she knew about his insecurity and used it, making her the asshole.\n\nThe key points are about consent to ask personal questions and the appropriateness of reciprocating in kind. The guy initiated by asking about her weight, which is a sensitive topic. She felt it was an invasion of privacy and responded by asking a similarly personal question. However, her friends see this as exploiting his insecurity, even if he brought it up. \n\nLegally, there's no issue here, but socially and ethically, it's about mutual respect. By asking about his size, she's mirroring his behavior but in a way that he didn't expect. The problem is that he didn't ask her about her weight with the intention of her reciprocating. She used his vulnerability to make a point, which he found uncomfortable. \n\nThe friends' reaction is important too. They see her as the aggressor because she took his insecurity and turned it into a personal question. However, her initial discomfort was valid, and she was asserting her boundaries. The question is whether her response was justified in that context. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people often don't like to be asked about their body size, especially in a way that could be judgmental. The guy's comment about her weight being \"okay\" for her height and age implies a judgment, which she found hurtful. Her retort was a form of pushing back, but it might have crossed a line by making the conversation more about his insecurities rather than addressing his comment constructively.\n\nThe friends' labeling her as the asshole stems from the idea that she used his known insecurity against him, which they see as unfair. However, she was responding to a personal attack, albeit in a way that might not have been the most diplomatic. The balance here is between standing up for oneself and respecting others' boundaries. \n\nIn conclusion, while the guy's initial question was inappropriate, her response might have been a valid attempt to hold him accountable for making her uncomfortable. However, by asking about his size, she might have overstepped, especially if he didn't invite that question. The friends' judgment is harsh, but her actions could be seen as a reciprocal response to his personal question. So, she's not entirely in the wrong, but maybe there's room for improvement in how she handled it.\n"
