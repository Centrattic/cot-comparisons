Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong (AITA). The key points here are about mutual respect and boundaries in conversations.\n\nFirst, the guy asked the author how much she weighs. The author felt uncomfortable because weight can be a sensitive topic. She answered but then the guy made a comment about her weight compared to his. That's where she got upset and asked why he asked. He justified it by saying it's just a question and even made a double standard argument about how guys can be discriminatory about weight since it's something people can control, unlike height. \n\nThe author then asked him about his insecurities regarding his dick size as a way to show him her perspective. He didn't respond and became embarrassed. The friends from his group later called the author an overreacting bitch because she knew about his insecurities and used that against him.\n\nNow, evaluating who's in the wrong. The guy started by asking a personal question that made the author uncomfortable. He then made a comparison and defended his actions by bringing up a double standard. The author's response was to ask a personal question back about his insecurities. While the author's approach might be seen as using his vulnerability to make a point, the initial issue was the guy crossing a boundary by asking about her weight and making a judgment. \n\nThe friends' reactions don't validate his actions. The guy's behavior was the first transgression. The author's response, while perhaps confrontational, was in reaction to his previous comments. However, using his known insecurity might be seen as harsh, but it's a form of showing empathy for her own experience. \n\nThe key here is whether the author overstepped. While her action was a response to his actions, it's possible she could have addressed the issue without reciprocating with a personal question. But given the context, her intention was to make him understand her discomfort. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't entirely in the wrong. The guy initiated the problematic behavior, and her response, though maybe not the most tactful, was an attempt to highlight the issue. The friends' judgment isn't valid because they didn't consider the guy's initial transgression. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
