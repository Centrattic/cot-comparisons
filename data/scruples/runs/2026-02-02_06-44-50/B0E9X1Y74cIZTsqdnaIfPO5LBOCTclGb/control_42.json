Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe guy asked the author how much she weighs, which made her uncomfortable. She responded by asking about his dick size as a way to show him how it feels. Then, his friends are calling her the asshole because she used his insecurity against him. \n\nHmm, so the key points here are about mutual respect and boundaries. The guy asked a personal question that upset her. She then asked a similarly personal question in return, which is a classic \"you do it too\" argument. But the friends are saying she's the problem because she knew about his insecurity and used it. \n\nI think the main issue is that both parties crossed each other's boundaries. The guy shouldn't have asked about her weight in a way that made her uncomfortable. However, the author's response was to ask about his insecurities, which might have been a way to teach a lesson, but it's not the most respectful approach. \n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong, maybe both have some responsibility. But the question is specifically if the author is in the wrong. Her friends are calling her the asshole because she used his insecurity. But she was reacting to his prior behavior. \n\nI need to consider social norms here. People often feel that body-related questions are personal and can be hurtful. The guy's comment about his own insecurity might have been a defense mechanism, but that doesn't justify the question. However, the author's response could be seen as using his vulnerability to make a point, which might not be fair. \n\nBut I also think that the guy's initial question was inappropriate, and the author had the right to set a boundary. By asking the question about his insecurities, she was trying to mirror his behavior to show him how it feels. While that might not be the best approach, it's a form of communication. \n\nThe friends' judgment might be biased because they support their friend. The author's actions were a reaction to being treated poorly first. So, maybe she's not in the wrong because she was defending her boundaries. \n\nBut there's a nuance here. Using someone's insecurity to show them your perspective can be seen as manipulative. However, she did stop when he asked her to. So perhaps there's a balance. \n\nIn conclusion, I think the author isn't in the wrong because she was responding to an uncomfortable situation and trying to communicate her feelings. The guy's friends might be missing the point by blaming her instead of the initial inappropriate question from the guy.\n"
