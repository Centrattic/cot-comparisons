Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy asking the author's weight, and then she retaliates by asking about his penis size. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The guy asked her weight after showing a post about a weightlifter's weight. She felt uncomfortable and responded, then he made a comment about her weight compared to his. She got upset and asked why he asked, leading to a back-and-forth where he defends his questioning. She then asks him about his penis size to show her perspective, which he found embarrassing. His friends later called her an asshole for exploiting his insecurity.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let me think about social norms and boundaries. Asking someone's weight can be personal and sensitive, especially for women. The guy's comment \"you weigh more than me\" might have been a backhanded compliment, which could be hurtful. However, retaliating by asking about his penis size is a direct and personal question as well. Both sides are crossing each other's boundaries here.\n\nThe guy's friends argue that she knew about his insecurity and used it against him, which is a form of manipulation. However, she felt he was being discriminatory by commenting on her weight, so she tried to mirror his behavior to make a point. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, both parties are at fault. The guy shouldn't have asked her weight in a way that made her uncomfortable. She shouldn't have responded with a similarly personal question. But the question is about the author's actions. Did she go too far?\n\nIf she asked the question as a form of pointing out the double standard, it's a common debate\u2014men can't control things like height but can control weight, so why the different treatment. However, using his personal insecurity as a weapon might be seen as taking advantage. Her friends label her as the asshole because she used his insecurity, which is a common societal judgment.\n\nBut from another angle, she was reacting to his comment about her weight, which was hurtful. She tried to show him how his question was personal by asking a similar question. It's a classic \"do unto others\" approach. However, that approach can sometimes backfire and be seen as mean-spirited.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the author is not entirely in the wrong. Both parties had issues. The guy asked an inappropriate question and made a comment that upset her. She responded in kind, which is understandable but also crosses a boundary. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since the guy started with the personal question and his comment, her response was a form of self-defense or pointing out hypocrisy. However, using his known insecurity might be seen as taking advantage. \n\nBut in the context of trying to teach him about the double standard, maybe it's justified. However, the friends' reaction suggests that society might see her as the asshole here. So maybe the answer is A (yes, she's in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nHmm. The user thinks she is in the wrong. I need to decide. The key is whether her action was a reasonable response or crossing the line. If she used his insecurity to make a point, which he didn't appreciate, even if he was wrong, maybe she overstepped. So answer A. But if she was trying to highlight the double standard, then B. It's a bit tricky. \n\nAlternatively, both are wrong, but the question is specifically about the author. Since the guy started it, maybe she's not entirely wrong. But the act of asking about his penis size in response is a personal question, so maybe she is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
