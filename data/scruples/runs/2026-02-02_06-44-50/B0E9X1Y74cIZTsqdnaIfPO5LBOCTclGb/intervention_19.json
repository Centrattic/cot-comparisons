Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong here. The situation involves a guy asking the author's weight, making a comment about him weighing more than him, and then the author retaliating by asking about his penis size. The guy didn't apologize, and friends are now calling the author an overreacting bitch.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The guy asked about the author's weight, which she found uncomfortable. He made a comment that she interpreted as her being fat, then she asked why he asked. He defended himself by saying it's just a question and made a double standard argument. The author then used his insecurity about his penis size to ask about it, which he found embarrassing. Friends are now siding with the guy.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about mutual respect in personal questions. The guy asked a personal question about weight, which is sensitive. The author felt uncomfortable and responded by asking a personal question about his penis size. The guy was defensive and didn't apologize, but the author's action might be seen as using his insecurity against him, which the friends criticized as taking advantage.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate both sides. Was the guy's question about weight inappropriate? Maybe, but sometimes people ask such questions without realizing. The author's response was to ask about his penis size, which is equally personal. However, the guy had teased others about his insecurity, so maybe the author was trying to show him the double standard.\n\nBut using someone's insecurity as a counterargument might not be the healthiest approach. The author wanted to make a point about mutual respect but perhaps crossed a line by directly asking a personal question. The guy's friends argue that she knew his insecurity and used it, which could be seen as taking advantage. However, the author's main issue was the initial inappropriate question and the guy's defensiveness. Her retaliation might be a form of holding him accountable, but it's a bit of a tit-for-tat.\n\nIn terms of ethics, both parties made personal questions, but the author's action might have been more about making a point than just being rude. However, asking about someone's penis size is still a personal topic, and while it's a way to highlight hypocrisy, it might not be the best approach. The guy's friends are likely biased, but their criticism isn't entirely without merit.\n\nSo, the author's action could be seen as a response to being disrespected, but it's still a personal question. The guy's initial question was also problematic. It's a bit of a gray area, but the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because she was responding to an uncomfortable situation and trying to show the double standard, even if her method was a bit confrontational. But maybe the answer is A because both parties acted inappropriately, but the author's retaliation is more in the wrong. Hmm. Alternatively, since the guy was already defensive and the author tried to make a point, perhaps B. But the friends are against her, so maybe A. I'm a bit torn here. Let me think again. The key is whether the author's action was inappropriate. Asking about his penis size in response to his weight comment might be seen as using his insecurity, which is not fair. So maybe A is the answer.\n"
