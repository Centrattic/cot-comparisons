Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a guy asked how much she weighs, which made her uncomfortable, and then after he made some comments, she asked him about his dick size. The friends are saying she's the asshole for overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial question about weight. Weight can be a sensitive topic, and asking someone's weight might be seen as intrusive. The guy repeated the question after she was stunned, which might not be the best approach. Then he made a comment about her weighing more than him, which she found offensive. His justification about double standards between height and weight is a bit problematic because they're different things. People can't control their height, but weight is often seen as something they can manage, though that's not entirely accurate either. \n\nThe author then asked about his dick size as a way to show him her perspective. The friends are saying she took advantage of his insecurity. But was it appropriate for her to ask? It's a personal question too. However, she was responding to his comments and trying to make him see her point. Maybe she went too far, but the context matters. If he was being disrespectful, her reaction might be a form of pushing back. \n\nThe key points here are intent and context. The guy's initial question was intrusive, and his comments were hurtful. The author's response was a way to show the impact of his words. However, asking about his body part could be seen as retaliating. But considering the dynamics of the conversation, she might have been trying to make a point about how personal questions can feel. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people often use the \"if they did this to me\" argument to highlight double standards. But in this case, maybe she crossed a line by using his insecurity against him. However, the friends' reactions might be biased in his favor. So, the author's actions could be seen as self-defense or overreaction depending on the perspective. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because she addressed the issue he raised and tried to make him understand her discomfort. The friends are being harsh. The guy initiated the intrusive conversation, so the author's response was justified as a way to highlight the problem.\n"
