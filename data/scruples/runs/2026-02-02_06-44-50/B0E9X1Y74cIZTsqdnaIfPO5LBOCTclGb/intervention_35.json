Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" post) is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: The guy asked the author how much she weighs, which she found uncomfortable. Then he made a comment about her weighing more than him, which she took as her being fat. She got upset, asked for the point of the question, and he responded with a defensive comment about her weight. She then asked him about his penis size as a way to show her perspective, which made him embarrassed and angry. The guy's friends are calling her a bitch for exploiting his insecurity.\n\nSo, the key points here are about consent and respect in personal questions. The guy asked a personal question about her weight, which she found offensive. In response, she asked a similarly personal question about his penis size. The guy's friends argue that she used his known insecurity against him, which is unfair. The author's side is that he was being rude by asking about her weight and making her uncomfortable, so she mirrored his behavior to show him the problem.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. The guy asked a personal question that made her uncomfortable, and she responded in kind. But is it okay to retaliate with another personal question? Typically, when someone is asked a question that makes them uncomfortable, responding with a similar question can be seen as using their own insecurities against them, which is not considered a good approach. It can come off as mean or manipulative, even if the intention was to make a point. The guy's friends are upset because she took advantage of his insecurity, which they see as a double standard.\n\nHowever, the original question was about her weight, which is a sensitive topic. She tried to address the issue by pointing out the problem, but when he didn't take it seriously, she escalated. The problem is whether her method of retaliation was appropriate. In general, using someone else's personal insecurities to make a point, even if the initial question was inappropriate, is not considered a mature or respectful approach. It can be seen as crossing a line, especially if it's intended to make the other person feel the same discomfort they caused.\n\nSo, while the guy did ask an inappropriate question, the author's response of asking about his penis size could be seen as using his vulnerability against him, which is inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not handling the situation with more grace. She could have set boundaries without retaliating. The friends' reactions might be harsh, but her method of response wasn't the best. However, the guy's initial question was definitely problematic. So it's a bit of a gray area.\n\nBut since the question is whether she's in the wrong, the answer likely leans towards A (Yes) because she used a personal question to retaliate, which isn't considered respectful, even if the initial question was rude. The response could be seen as an overreaction that targeted his insecurities.\n"
