Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy asking the author how much she weighs after she asked him about his penis size in return. The guy was insecure about his penis size, which the author knew. The friends are blaming the author for overreacting.\n\nFirst, the guy asked about her weight, which she found personal and uncomfortable. He then made a comment about her weight compared to his, which she took as an insult. She responded by asking about his penis size to make him feel the same discomfort. The friends are saying she used his insecurity against him.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, asking about weight can be sensitive and is often considered personal. The guy's comments were hurtful and dismissive of her discomfort. On the other hand, the author retaliated by bringing up a topic she knew made him uncomfortable, using his insecurity to make a point. \n\nIs retaliating in this way appropriate? It's a form of emotional manipulation, using someone's insecurity to teach them a lesson. While the guy's initial question was problematic, the author's response might mirror his behavior, creating a cycle of hurt. The friends are criticizing her for overreacting, but maybe the core issue is that both topics are sensitive and shouldn't be discussed in that manner. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was justified. She had the right to express her discomfort, but using his insecurity to make him feel bad might not be the healthiest approach. However, she was trying to show him how his behavior affected her. It's a bit of a gray area, but the author's action might be seen as using the same tactics she criticized in him. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because she didn't address his behavior without reciprocating the hurtful behavior.\n"
