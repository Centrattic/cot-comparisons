Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong (ITA) or not (AITA). So the scenario is about a guy asking the author how much she weighs, which makes her uncomfortable. She then asks him about his penis size as a response, and he gets embarrassed but her friends call her an asshole for it.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The guy asked her weight, which she found personal and made her uncomfortable. She didn't want to confront him about his comment that she's not morbidly fat, so she just answered. Then he made a comment about her being an \"ok weight,\" which she took as an insult. She then asked about his penis size, which he didn't like, and their friends are on his side.\n\nThe key points here are about personal boundaries and reciprocity. The author felt that the guy overstepped by asking her weight, which is a sensitive topic for her. By asking his size, she was trying to show him how she felt about his question. However, some might argue that she escalated the situation by bringing up a different sensitive topic. But others might say she was just pointing out the double standard where he's allowed to ask about her weight (something she can control) but is upset when she asks about his body (something he can't control, per his argument).\n\nThe guy's friends called her an asshole because they thought she used his insecurity about his penis size. But the author's friends might not see their own double standard. The guy's argument about double standards is flawed because weight and body size are different from other attributes. Also, the guy's initial question was about her weight, which she found uncomfortable. His comment about her weight being \"ok\" was dismissive and possibly hurtful.\n\nIn terms of social norms, asking someone's weight is often seen as intrusive, especially for women. The guy might not realize the sensitivity around weight, but that doesn't make the question acceptable. The author's response was to mirror his behavior, which might be a teaching moment, but it could also be seen as retaliation. However, her intention was to show him the issue with his question.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting a boundary and pointing out the problem with his question. Her friends' reactions might be influenced by their own biases and the guy's insecurity. So the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
