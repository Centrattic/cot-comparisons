Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question) is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy asking the author about their weight after they went on a date, and then the author responding by asking about his penis size.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around personal questions. Weight can be a sensitive topic for many people. The guy asked a personal question, which made the author uncomfortable. The author then mirrored the question back to him regarding his penis size. Now, asking about someone's weight is often seen as intrusive, especially in a casual or early dating context. Penis size is similarly a private matter, and bringing it up can be considered inappropriate unless it's mutual and both parties are comfortable.\n\nThe guy's initial question about weight might have been inconsiderate. The author's response was to reciprocate with a question that the guy found embarrassing. The friends later criticized the author for using the guy's insecurity against him. The key here is whether the author's action was proportionate or manipulative. The author might have felt justified because the guy used their insecurity about weight, so they wanted to show him the other side. However, using someone's insecurity in this way could be seen as taking advantage of the situation for their own point, even if it's to highlight a double standard.\n\nAnother angle is consent and mutual respect. The guy's question was inappropriate, and the author's response, while perhaps intended to teach a lesson, might also be crossing a boundary. The author could have addressed the issue without reciprocating in kind. Also, the guy didn't apologize, but the author's action might have been a form of retaliation, which could be seen as inconsiderate in its own right.\n\nSocial norms often frown upon using someone's insecurities as a form of comeuppance, even if the initial action was wrong. The author's approach might have been a way to demonstrate the harm of making personal comments, but it could also be viewed as escalating the situation unnecessarily. The friends' reaction suggests that the community or social group has a different perspective, considering the author's action as overstepping.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, there's the idea of \"do unto others,\" but when both actions are negative, it's a bit of a dilemma. The author might not be in the wrong because they were defending their own boundaries after being made uncomfortable. However, the method they chose could be problematic. The guy's actions were definitely inconsiderate, but the author's response might have been a form of tit-for-tat, which isn't always the best approach.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's action was a reaction to a personal question that made them uncomfortable. While the guy's initial question was inappropriate, the author's response might have been equally so, even if their intent was to highlight the double standard. Therefore, the author could be considered in the wrong for using the same type of personal question as a form of retaliation, even if they felt justified.\n"
