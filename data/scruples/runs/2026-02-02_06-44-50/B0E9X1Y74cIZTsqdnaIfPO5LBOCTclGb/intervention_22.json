Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a guy asking the author's weight, which made her uncomfortable, leading her to ask about his dick size to show her point. The friends are calling her the asshole for that.\n\nFirst, the guy asked a personal question about weight. Weight can be a sensitive topic, so it's understandable that the author felt uncomfortable. When he asked how much she weighs, she answered, but then he made a comment about her weight compared to his, which she found harsh. She confronts him, he defends himself, and then she asks about his dick size to mirror his behavior. \n\nNow, the key points here: The guy's actions were inappropriate by bringing up weight, which is a personal topic. The author's response was to use his own insecurity (about his dick size) to highlight the double standard. The friends are criticizing her for using his insecurity against him, even though the guy initiated the sensitive topic. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, she responded in kind, which might be seen as using his insecurity to teach a lesson. On the other hand, she was defending her own boundaries after being made uncomfortable. \n\nThe guy's behavior included asking about her weight and then making a comparative comment, which could be seen as discriminatory or body-shaming. The author's response was a direct challenge to that behavior by flipping the script. However, asking about his dick size might be seen as crossing a line, even if it's to make a point. But considering the context of the conversation and the guy's own comments, her action could be a valid form of showing how his comments affected her. \n\nThe friends' reaction is also relevant. They think she's overstepping because she used his insecurity, but she had a reason to feel uncomfortable. The guy didn't apologize, which suggests he didn't acknowledge her perspective. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the initial problem was the guy's inappropriate question and comment. The author's response was a way to confront that, even if her method might be seen as harsh. However, using someone's insecurity as a response could be perceived as manipulative or retaliatory. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's action was a proportional response. Since the guy started the conversation with a sensitive topic and made her feel judged, her asking about his dick size was an attempt to mirror his behavior and show the double standard. While it's a bold move, it's not inherently wrong if it's to highlight the issue. The friends are wrong to label her as the asshole because the guy's initial behavior was the problem. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
