Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: the guy asked the author how much she weighs. She found it uncomfortable and then he made a comment about her weight compared to his. She got angry and asked him about his dick size to show her perspective. He didn't respond, but others in their friend group called her an overreacting bitch. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my take.\n\nHmm. So, the guy's question about weight was personal. Weight can be a sensitive topic, and it's generally considered inappropriate to ask someone else's weight. Then he made a comment that made her feel judged. She responded by asking about his dick size, which is also a personal and sensitive topic. The friends are upset because she used his insecurity against him.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and boundaries. The guy overstepped by asking a personal question and then making a comment. The author responded in kind, bringing up his insecurity. Both parties crossed lines, perhaps. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe user's friend group is defending the guy, saying she took advantage of his insecurity. But he didn't apologize. The author tried to show him the perspective by mirroring his behavior. Is that justified? Maybe not. Using someone's insecurity as a retort isn't the healthiest approach. However, the initial act of asking about weight was also wrong. \n\nSo, the author was in a defensive position. She might have felt justified in pushing back, but the method she used was also personal. The guy had the first wrong by asking about weight. However, when she confronted him and asked about his dick size, that escalated things. \n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong, both made mistakes. But the question is about the author specifically. The user says they think she is in the wrong. I need to decide if her response was appropriate. \n\nHer asking about his dick size as a retort might have been crossing a line, even if she was reacting to his comment. It's possible she took the conversation into a place that was equally disrespectful. The friends' reactions suggest they saw her as the aggressor. \n\nBut the key here is whether the author was wrong. The guy started it with the personal question, but her response was also personal. It's a mutual issue. However, in terms of who is more in the wrong, perhaps the guy started it, but the author's response could be seen as equally wrong. \n\nBut the question is about the author. So if the author's response was inappropriate, then yes, she's in the wrong. If she was just mirroring his behavior in a way to make a point, maybe not. But generally, asking someone about their body size in a personal context is not appropriate regardless of the situation. So the answer might be A (Yes, she's in the wrong) because she retaliated with a personal question. Even if her intention was to show him the perspective, the action was still inappropriate. However, if the guy was the initial aggressor, that complicates things. But the question is about her specifically. \n\nAlternatively, maybe B (No, she's not in the wrong) because she was responding to his initial transgression. But the problem is that both acted inappropriately. The answer might depend on cultural context or social norms. In some views, both are wrong. But the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nConsidering that, I think the answer is A, because she crossed a line by asking about his body part. Even if he started it, her response was also a personal attack. So she's in the wrong. But I might be biased towards the idea that both are wrong. However, the user is asking specifically about the author. So if the answer is A, then the author is in the wrong. But maybe B, because she was reacting to his behavior. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe B because the guy was the one who started it, and she was just showing him the same treatment. But in reality, both behaved inappropriately, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user's friends think she is. The answer might depend on the perspective. If the author's action was a justified response, then B. If it's an overreaction, then A. \n\nI think in this case, even though the guy was wrong first, the author's response was also wrong. So she is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
