Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy asking the author about her weight, which made her uncomfortable. She then asked about his dick size in response, leading to some backlash from his friends.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The guy asked a personal question about her weight, which is a sensitive topic. His comment about her weighing more than him and making a judgment about her weight could be seen as insensitive. The author felt she had to respond in kind by asking about his dick size, which is also a personal topic. His friends are saying she overstepped because she knew about his insecurity and used it to make a point.\n\nNow, considering social norms. Both weight and genital size are topics that many people find personal. The guy initiated by asking about her weight, which is generally considered a private matter. His justification that it's a \"double standard\" because men can't change their height but can their weight is a flawed argument. The author's response was to mirror his behavior by asking about his dick size. While she might have been trying to show the inappropriateness of his question, using his insecurity against him could be seen as taking the situation too far, especially since he didn't ask her about his size first. However, he did make her feel uncomfortable, so her reaction might be understandable in that context.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's action was a proportionate response. By asking the question, she escalated the situation instead of addressing the discomfort directly. His friends felt she was being a bitch because she used his insecurity, which might imply that her response was more about retaliation than standing up for herself. But on the other hand, he started by asking a personal question that hurt her feelings. \n\nIn many social situations, responding in kind to someone's personal question with another personal question can be seen as a tit-for-tat approach. However, since the guy didn't ask her about his size first, her response might be considered an overreaction. She could have addressed his comment about weight by expressing her discomfort without reciprocating with a question about his body. \n\nTherefore, while the guy's initial question was inappropriate, the author's choice to mirror that behavior by asking a personal question about his body might make her complicit in the inappropriateness. Her friends' reaction suggests that they see her response as crossing a boundary, even if her intention was to highlight the issue. So, considering the context and the responses from both sides, the author's action might be seen as in the wrong because she escalated the situation in a way that others found disrespectful.\n"
