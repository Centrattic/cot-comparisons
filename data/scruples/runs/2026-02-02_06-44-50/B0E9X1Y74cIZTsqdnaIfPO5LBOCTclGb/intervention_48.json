Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy asking the woman about her weight after she asked him about his fitness, and then she responds by asking him about his penis size. The guy didn't apologize, and his friends called her an overreacting bitch. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation step by step. The guy asked her weight, which made her uncomfortable. She answered, and then he made a comment about her weight compared to his. She got angry and asked him why he asked, leading to a discussion where he defends his question. She then asks him about his penis size to make him feel the same discomfort. The friends side with him, saying she took advantage of his insecurity.\n\nSo the key points here: the guy asked a personal question, she felt uncomfortable but answered. He then made a comment that she felt was disrespectful. She retaliated by asking a similarly personal question about his insecurities. The friends think she overreacted.\n\nNow, considering social norms, asking someone's weight can be seen as invasive, especially since weight is a sensitive topic. The guy's comment about her weight being \"ok\" but not morbidly fat could be dismissive. However, her response was to ask about his penis size, which is also a personal and potentially embarrassing question. Using his known insecurity to mirror his behavior might be seen as hypocritical, even if she's trying to make a point. \n\nThe guy didn't apologize, but she also didn't let the matter rest in a respectful way. Instead of addressing the issue calmly, she escalated it by asking him a question that he found embarrassing. This could be seen as a tit-for-tat approach, which might not resolve the issue and could be viewed as inconsiderate, even if she was trying to highlight the double standard. \n\nThe friends' reactions suggest that in their group, they find it acceptable for men to ask about weight but not for women to reciprocate. The author's response might be seen as crossing a line because it's using his insecurity against him, especially when he didn't apologize. Even if she was pointing out a double standard, her method might be considered inconsiderate or manipulative.\n\nHowever, the initial question from the guy was problematic. He asked a personal question that made her uncomfortable, then made a comment she found hurtful. She had the right to express her discomfort, but her response of asking about his penis size might have been too direct and could be seen as the wrong way to handle it. There's a balance between standing up for oneself and escalating the conflict in a way that's equally hurtful.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions might be seen as in the wrong because she retaliated in a way that was perceived as taking advantage of his insecurity, even if her intention was to make a point about the double standard. Her friends' reaction supports that. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
