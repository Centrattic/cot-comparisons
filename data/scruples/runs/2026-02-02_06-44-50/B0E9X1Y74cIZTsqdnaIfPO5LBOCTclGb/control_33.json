Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy asking the author about her weight, then making a comment that made her uncomfortable, leading her to ask about his dick size. His friends are saying she's the asshole because she used his insecurity against him.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The guy asked her weight, which she found personal and uncomfortable. He then made a comment about her weight compared to his, which she took as harsh. She asked him about his dick size to show her perspective, which embarrassed him, and his friends are upset with her for using his insecurity.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, weight is a sensitive topic, and asking about someone's weight can be considered personal and invasive. The guy's approach was inappropriate, especially since it led to a comment that made her feel judged. The author's response was to ask a similarly personal question about his body part, which he found embarrassing. His friends argue that she used his known insecurity, but the author was trying to mirror the way he had used her sensitivity.\n\nI think the main issue is whether the author's response was justified. She felt wronged by his initial question and his comments. Her question about his dick size was a way to highlight the double standard he was pointing out. However, using someone's insecurity directly might not be the best approach, but it's a reaction to his actions. The guy was in the wrong for making her feel uncomfortable, and the author's response, while perhaps not the most mature, was an attempt to make him see her side. His friends' judgment of her as the asshole might be because they didn't consider her perspective. So, the author isn't in the wrong because the initial issue was the guy's inappropriate behavior. Answer B.\n"
