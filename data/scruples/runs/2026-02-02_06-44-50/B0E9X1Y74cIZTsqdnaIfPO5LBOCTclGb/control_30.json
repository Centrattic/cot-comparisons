Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation: The guy asked the author how much she weighs, which made her uncomfortable. She answered, but he then made a comment implying she weighed more than him. She got angry and asked why he asked, leading to a discussion where he made her feel judged. She then asked about his insecurities regarding his dick size, which made him embarrassed. His friends later called her an overreacting bitch because she used his insecurity against him, even though he didn't know about her weight insecurities.\n\nSo, the key points here are about boundaries and mutual respect. The guy asked a personal question that made her uncomfortable. She answered but then he made a comment that felt judgmental. She tried to explain her discomfort and used his own vulnerability to make him see her perspective. The friends are upset because she used his known insecurity against him, even though he didn't know she had a weight issue.\n\nNow, considering social norms and consent. Asking someone's weight can be a sensitive topic, especially if it's not mutually agreed upon. The guy asked first, which is problematic because it's not a neutral question. The author then asked about his body part, which is equally personal. The friends think she's the asshole because she used his insecurity, but the guy didn't apologize for his comments. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, both parties might have crossed lines. The guy shouldn't have asked about her weight and made a comparative comment. The author responded in a way that highlighted his insecurity, which could be seen as using his vulnerability. However, she was reacting to his initial inappropriate question and comments. The friends' judgment is also a factor here, as they're using a double standard. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the guy's actions started the conflict. He asked a personal question and then made her feel judged. The author's response was a reaction to that, trying to make him understand her perspective. Her asking about his insecurities might be seen as tit-for-tat, but in the context of the conversation, it was a way to show him how his actions affected her. \n\nThe friends' reactions are also important. They're quick to label her as the asshole without considering the dynamics of the situation. They're focusing on her using his insecurity, but not on his initial transgression. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for responding to his inappropriate question, but her method might be debatable. However, the main issue is that the guy opened the door by asking a personal question and making her feel judged. The author's response was a way to communicate her boundaries, which is valid. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
