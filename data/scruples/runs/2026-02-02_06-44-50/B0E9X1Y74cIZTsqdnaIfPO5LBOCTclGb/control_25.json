Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy asking the author's weight, making a comment that the author felt was offensive, and then the author responding by asking about his penis size. The friends are saying the author was in the wrong for using his insecurity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy asked about the author's weight, which the author found uncomfortable. Weight can be a sensitive topic, and even if it's a straightforward question, it's rude to ask someone's weight. The guy then made a comment about her weight being okay, which could come off as dismissive or even judgmental. The author felt offended and tried to explain her discomfort, but he defended himself and brought up a \"double standard\" argument.\n\nThe author then asked about his penis size as a way to show him how it feels to be asked a personal question. This seems like a form of reverse psychology or trying to put him in her shoes. However, this might not have been fair because while weight was the immediate issue, the guy's insecurity about his penis size was known through teasing from friends. The author used that to highlight the problem, but the friends are now calling her an overreactor for using his vulnerability against him.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, asking someone's weight is generally considered impolite. The guy shouldn't have asked, and the author was within her rights to feel uncomfortable and set boundaries. However, her response of asking about his penis size might be seen as crossing a line, especially if she knew he was insecure about it. While her intention was to make him understand her perspective, using his insecurity in that way could be seen as exploiting it, which is why the friends are criticizing her. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of consent and mutual respect. If the guy made her feel uncomfortable, she had the right to respond in a way that communicated that. However, directly asking about his penis size might not be the most effective or respectful way to do that. It could be argued that she escalated the situation by using his personal insecurity as a countermeasure, which led to his embarrassment. The friends' reaction probably stems from the idea that she took advantage of his known insecurities to make a point, which they see as unfair.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy's initial question and comments were the root of the problem. He asked a personal question, made a comment that was dismissive, and then didn't apologize. The author's response was an attempt to make him understand her feelings, which is a valid form of self-advocacy. However, the method she used might have been inappropriate because it involved a personal question about him that he's known to be sensitive about. \n\nIn terms of social norms, both parties did something that's generally considered impolite. But the key issue is who initiated the inappropriate behavior. The guy asked the question first, which started the problem. The author's response was a reaction to his actions, but perhaps not the best way to handle it. However, given that the guy didn't apologize and continued to defend himself, her frustration is understandable. \n\nThe friends' criticism might be influenced by their own biases and the way they view the situation. They might not understand the weight sensitivity as much as they do the guy's insecurity about his penis size. This could lead them to label her as the problem, even if the guy's actions were the initial issue.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's response might not have been the most appropriate, the root problem was the guy's initial question and comments. However, by using his insecurity in a way that embarrassed him, she might be seen as retaliating in a way that's not respectful, which could place some blame on her. But considering the context of his actions, it's a nuanced situation. The answer would depend on whether the retaliation was justified. Since the guy's actions were first, but her response might be seen as crossing a line, the answer might lean towards her being in the wrong. However, there's a strong argument that the guy's initial behavior was worse. The friends' judgment might not fully account for the initial transgression.\n"
