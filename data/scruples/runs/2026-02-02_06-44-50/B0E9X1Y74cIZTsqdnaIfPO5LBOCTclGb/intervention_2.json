Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a guy asked the author how much she weighs during a date, which made her uncomfortable. She responded by asking about his dick size, and then the friend group thinks she's the asshole. \n\nFirst, I need to break this down. The guy asked a personal question about her weight. Weight can be a sensitive topic for many people, so her discomfort makes sense. He then made a comment that she weighs more than him, which she took as an insult. She challenges him about why he asked, and he gets defensive, bringing up double standards about how guys can be discriminatory about weight since they can control it, unlike height. \n\nThen she asks him about his dick size, which he's insecure about. The friends say she exploited his insecurity. The question is whether she was wrong to ask that. \n\nOn one hand, the guy initiated by asking a personal question. If he was okay with that, maybe he shouldn't be surprised when she reciprocated. But on the other hand, asking about someone's body, especially in a sensitive way, can be seen as crossing a line. The key here is whether the author's response was a proportional reaction. \n\nThe guy's behavior was inappropriate by bringing up her weight in a way that made her feel targeted. The author's response was to flip the script and ask about his dick size. While it's a personal question, maybe she was trying to show him the hurtfulness of his comment. However, using his insecurity against him might not be the best approach. \n\nThe friends' reaction suggests that they see her as the overreacting party because she knew about his insecurity. But the original issue was his inappropriate question. It's possible that he crossed a boundary first, so her reaction, while maybe not the best method, was about addressing that boundary issue. \n\nBut then, asking about his body in response could be seen as equally inappropriate. However, it's also about mutual respect and understanding that certain topics are off-limits. The guy's comment about double standards is problematic because weight is a sensitive topic regardless of control. \n\nUltimately, the guy started the exchange with an uncomfortable question. The author then mirrored the question to highlight the issue. While her approach might not have been the most effective, the initial wrongdoing was his. The friends' judgment of her as the asshole might be because they don't see the context of his behavior. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If the question was meant to show him how his behavior affected her, then maybe she's not in the wrong. But if she should have handled it differently, perhaps a \"B\" answer. But the key is whether her action was a reasonable response to his initial inappropriate question. Since he started it, maybe she's not in the wrong.\n"
