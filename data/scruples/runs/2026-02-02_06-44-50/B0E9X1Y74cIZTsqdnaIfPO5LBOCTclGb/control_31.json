Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a guy asked the author's weight, which made her uncomfortable. She then asked about his dick size as a response, and now the friend group is calling her the asshole. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The guy asked her weight, which she found uncomfortable. He then made a comment about her weight being higher than his, which she interpreted as her being fat. She got angry and asked him why he asked, leading to an argument. She then used his insecurity about his dick size to counter, which embarrassed him. The friends are saying she overreacted because she knew his insecurity but didn't know his about weight.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether her response was justified. Weight is a sensitive topic, and asking someone's weight can be intrusive. The guy's comment about her weight being higher than his might have crossed a line. Her asking about his dick size was a direct response to his comment, using his own insecurity. But the friends are saying it's a double standard because she took advantage of his insecurity.\n\nIn terms of social norms, both weight and body size can be sensitive. However, the guy's approach was to comment on her weight in a way that made her feel judged. Her response was a form of tit-for-tat, which might be seen as fair by some, but others might think it's not appropriate. The key here is mutual respect and understanding sensitivities.\n\nThe author did acknowledge his insecurity but felt his actions were disrespectful. Her action was to mirror his behavior, which could be seen as fair if she felt he was being discriminatory. However, using his insecurity in a public or semi-public setting (even if it was between them) could be seen as cruel, especially if it made him embarrassed. \n\nBut considering that the guy was dismissive of her discomfort and even made a defensive comment about double standards between genders, her response might be a justified way to highlight that. The friends' reaction might stem from not understanding the context of his comments and her discomfort.\n\nIn conclusion, she wasn't in the wrong for responding as she did because she was defending her boundaries after he overstepped. The friends are incorrect in labeling her as the asshole. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
