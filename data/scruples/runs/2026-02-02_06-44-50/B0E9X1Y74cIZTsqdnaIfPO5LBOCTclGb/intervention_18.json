Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong after asking a guy about his dick size following a question about her weight. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy asked her how much she weighs, which she found uncomfortable. He then made a comment that she perceived as critical, and she responded by questioning his motivation. After he started defending himself and making a rant about double standards, she asked about his dick size to mirror his insecurity. \n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and boundaries. The guy's initial question about her weight was personal and made her uncomfortable. Her response was to ask about his body size, which he found embarrassing and didn't answer. The friends labeled her as the asshole because she knew his insecurity and used it against him. \n\nI think the guy had no right to ask about her weight in the first place, especially in a casual setting where it's not relevant. However, the author's retaliation by asking about his dick size, while understandable as a form of showing him his own behavior, might be crossing a boundary she wouldn't want to be crossed herself. Even if it's to make a point, it's a personal question that can be hurtful. The friends' reaction suggests that they see it as an unfair advantage, exploiting his insecurity. \n\nSo, while the guy's behavior was inconsiderate, the author's response, though possibly intended to teach a lesson, might have been equally disrespectful. The question is whether her actions were justified. If the goal was to make him understand her perspective, using his insecurity as a tool might be seen as manipulative rather than constructive. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting his boundaries in a way that's similar to how he didn't respect hers. \n\nBut there's a nuance here. The guy's comment about weight was harsh, and her response was a form of mirroring. However, the appropriateness of such a response depends on the cultural context and the expectations within their friend group. If the friends are male and more comfortable with body-related teasing, maybe the author's approach was seen as harsh. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's action might not be the outright wrong, but she could be in the wrong for not considering the social dynamics and the potential impact of her question. However, the initial question from the guy was also inconsiderate. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards her being in the wrong because she used his insecurity in a way that could be seen as retaliatory rather than constructive.\n"
