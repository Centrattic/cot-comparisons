Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a guy asking the author's weight, which made her uncomfortable. She then retaliates by asking about his penis size, leading to conflict and judgment from his friends.\n\nFirst, the guy asked a personal question about her weight. While weight can be sensitive, it's a common topic of awkward conversation. However, his follow-up comment about her weighing more than him and his insensitivity when she challenged him were problematic. His justification about a double standard and the harsh comments about her weight were definitely inappropriate and could be seen as cruel.\n\nThe author felt uncomfortable and tried to address the issue by asking a similarly personal question about his dick size. While she might have felt justified in responding in kind, using his insecurity as a point to highlight her perspective could be seen as exploiting his vulnerability. However, considering the context\u2014his offensive remarks and lack of empathy\u2014her response might be a reaction to being treated unfairly.\n\nThe friends' reaction to her as the \"bitch\" seems to miss the point. The guy initiated the offensive behavior, and her response, while confrontational, was a form of pushing back against his inconsiderate comments. The friends are focusing on the method rather than the initial insensitivity.\n\nIn terms of accountability, both parties have issues. The guy shouldn't have asked personal questions and made hurtful remarks. The author reacted defensively, which might not be the best approach, but it's a response to being put on the spot and feeling disrespected. The key is whether the author had the right to ask the question. Since personal topics are subjective, and he started with a sensitive question, her response could be seen as a fair pushback. However, using his insecurity in a public or semi-public setting might have been unkind, but given the context, it's a complex situation.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't entirely in the wrong. The guy's actions were more offensive, and her response was a reaction to his behavior. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
