Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) question is in the wrong. The scenario involves a guy asking the author how much she weighs, which makes her uncomfortable. The author then asks him about his dick size in response, leading to some backlash from his friends.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The guy asked the author's weight, which she found personal and uncomfortable. He followed up by saying she weighs more than him, which she took as an insult. She confronted him, leading to an argument where he defended his questions and accused her of being overly sensitive. She then asked about his dick size, which made him embarrassed, and his friends called her an asshole for using his insecurity against him.\n\nThe key points here are about personal boundaries and mutual respect. The guy asked a personal question that made her uncomfortable. His comment about her weight and the subsequent defense might have crossed a line. The author's response was to ask a question she knew he was sensitive about. \n\nIs it fair to ask a personal question in return if someone else asks one? It's a classic tit-for-tat scenario. However, the context matters. If the initial question was intrusive, the author's response might be seen as a way to teach a lesson, but it's a tricky approach. She might be in the right for standing up for herself, but maybe the method was not the best. However, the guy's behavior in asking a personal question and then being defensive could be the main issue here.\n\nThe friends' reaction also points out that they think using his insecurity against him is wrong. But if he was the one who started by making her uncomfortable, their judgment might be biased. The author is trying to show him the hurt he caused by mirroring her experience with his. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people often don't like to be asked about their weight or body size, and it's generally considered rude. The guy's initial question was inappropriate, and his follow-up comments were harsh. The author's response, while confrontational, was an attempt to highlight the double standard. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? She was responding to his inappropriate behavior. If he had apologized or acknowledged her discomfort, maybe a different approach would have been better. But given his defensiveness and the context, her reaction might be justified. The friends' criticism might be missing the point that the guy started the issue. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
