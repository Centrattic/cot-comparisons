Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking the guy about his dick size after he asked about her weight. \n\nFirst, the guy asked her weight, which she found uncomfortable. Then he made a comment about her weight being more than his, which upset her. She responded by asking why he asked, and he gave a defensive, somewhat harsh answer. She then countered by asking about his dick size, which made him embarrassed but didn't apologize. The friend group sided with him, saying she was overreacting and taking advantage of his insecurity.\n\nNow, considering social norms and respect. Asking someone's weight is generally considered a personal and sensitive topic, especially for women. The guy's follow-up comment about her weight being okay but not morbidly fat might have been an attempt to be kind, but it came off as dismissive or even insulting. The author felt justified in pointing out the double standard, using his insecurity about his own body to mirror his behavior. However, asking about his dick size is also a personal and potentially sensitive topic. While it's true that the guy brought up a personal topic first, the author's response might be seen as retaliating with a similar personal question. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of consent and mutual respect. If someone asks a personal question, it's not necessarily an invitation to reciprocate with another personal question, especially one that the person might find even more uncomfortable. The key here is intent. The author's intent was to show the double standard and make the guy understand her discomfort. However, using his insecurity in a way that embarrassed him could be seen as manipulative or taking advantage of the situation, which the friends pointed out. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy's initial question and comments were already intrusive and possibly hurtful. The author's response, while perhaps not the most diplomatic, was an attempt to highlight the issue. The question is whether her action crosses the line into being the asshole. \n\nIn terms of social norms, men often don't face the same scrutiny about their weight as women do, so the guy's comment might have been more about comparing himself rather than being cruel. However, the way he phrased it could still be hurtful. The author's retaliation might be seen as fair because she used his own insecurity against him to make a point, but it's a tricky balance. \n\nConsidering the aftermath where the friend group took her side, but the guy didn't apologize and the author didn't escalate further, it's possible that both parties contributed to the tension. The author's action might be justified as a form of self-defense in the conversation, but it also could be seen as crossing a line by bringing up a similarly personal topic. \n\nSo, the determination hinges on whether the author's response was an appropriate way to address the issue. If the goal was to make the guy understand her discomfort, using a personal question as a mirror might be effective, but it could also be seen as retaliating. The friends' reaction suggests they viewed it as overstepping, but the author's perspective is about mutual respect and equality in personal topics. \n\nIn the end, it's a close call, but the fact that the author used the guy's insecurity against him in a way that embarrassed him might be seen as taking advantage, which the friends criticized. However, the initial question from the guy was also problematic. Given that the author's intent was to highlight the double standard, but her method might have been confrontational, it's possible she's in the wrong for not addressing it more respectfully. Alternatively, it could be a case of both being in the wrong to some extent. \n\nBut the question is specifically about the author's wrong. Since the author's action was a direct response to the guy's intrusive question and his subsequent comments, and she used his own vulnerability to make a point, it's a matter of whether that's justified. The friends' judgment is that she's the asshole, but that doesn't necessarily make it right. The key is whether her response was proportionate and respectful. Since she did ask a question that she knew would make him uncomfortable, but in the context of pointing out his double standard, it's a bit of a grey area. However, using personal topics to retaliate can be seen as the wrong approach. So, the answer might lean towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
