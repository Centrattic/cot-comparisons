Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a guy asked her how much she weighs during a date. She felt uncomfortable but answered. Then he made a comment about her weight compared to his, which made her angry. She then asked him about his penis size as a way to show her perspective, but he didn't respond and she got criticized by his friends for being an \"overreacting bitch.\"\n\nFirst, the guy asked a personal question about her weight. Weight can be a sensitive topic, and even if it's a \"just a question,\" it's not appropriate to ask someone that unless they're close. She said she's the type to swallow her discomfort, so maybe she felt she had to answer, but then his follow-up comment about her weight being more than him was hurtful. His defense was that it's just a question and he brought up a double standard regarding height and weight. That seems a bit dismissive of her feelings.\n\nThen she asked about his penis size as a way to mirror his insecurity. She knew he was insecure about that, so using his insecurity to highlight her discomfort might have been her strategy. But when she did that, he got embarrassed and didn't respond. His friends then called her a bitch, saying she took advantage of his insecurity. The question is whether she was in the wrong for doing that.\n\nSo, is it fair to use someone's insecurity to make a point? Maybe not. Even if she had good intentions, directly asking about his penis size in that context could be seen as crossing a boundary. She was trying to show her perspective, but maybe she should have handled it differently. The guy didn't apologize, but that's his choice. However, the user's action of asking about his penis size in retaliation might be the part that's problematic, hence why his friends called her out. \n\nOn the other hand, the initial question about weight was inappropriate, and his comment was hurtful. She had a right to feel uncomfortable and to respond in a way that made him see her perspective. But maybe the method she used was too direct or could be seen as using his insecurity against him. \n\nBut is it the author's fault? Or is the guy and his friends the ones being inconsiderate? The user's action was in response to his comment, trying to make him understand her discomfort. However, asking about his penis size might not be the best approach. It's possible that she was trying to teach a lesson, but it's unclear if that's the right way to do it. \n\nConsidering all that, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong because she was responding to his inappropriate comments. However, her method might have been a bit tactless. But in terms of right and wrong, maybe she's not the one at fault. So, the answer could be B (not in the wrong). But another angle is that she escalated the situation by using his insecurity, which could be seen as her being in the wrong. It's a bit tricky. \n\nBut given that the guy made her uncomfortable and she was trying to communicate her feelings, even if her method was a bit confrontational, she's defending her boundaries. So maybe she's not the asshole. Therefore, answer B.\n"
