Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy asking about the author's weight after she asked about his penis size. The key points here are the context of the conversation, the intentions behind the questions, and the reactions from both parties.\n\nFirst, the guy asked the author how much she weighed during a date. The author felt uncomfortable because weight can be a sensitive topic. She responded and then the guy made a comment about her weight relative to his, which upset her. She then asked him about his penis size, which made him embarrassed, and his friends later called her an overreacting bitch because she used his insecurity against him.\n\nThe author's friends argue that since she knew his insecurity, she took advantage by asking about his penis size. However, the author's main issue was the guy's comment about her weight, which made her feel judged. She tried to mirror his behavior to show him how it felt. \n\nIn terms of social norms, asking someone's weight can be considered intrusive, especially if it's not a mutual topic of discussion. The guy's comment about her weight being \"ok\" but not \"morbidly fat\" might have been meant to reassure, but it came off as dismissive. The author's response was to reciprocate by asking about his penis size, which is also a personal question. However, doing this to highlight the double standard might be seen as using his insecurity to make a point. \n\nBut considering that the initial question from the guy was the catalyst, and the author's reaction was a form of showing the double standard, it's a bit of a gray area. The friends' reaction suggests they see it as the author being the asshole because she used his insecurity, but others might argue it's about the initial invasive question. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was a proportionate and justified way to address the discomfort caused. Since the guy's question was personal and made her uncomfortable, her response might be seen as a way to illustrate the issue. However, using his specific insecurity might be seen as cruel. \n\nBut the main question is if the author is in the wrong. Given that the guy initiated the personal question and made her uncomfortable, the author's response might be a valid form of highlighting the double standard, even if it was a bit harsh. So the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). However, some might argue that her response was also inappropriate, hence A. \n\nBut given the context, the initial question was the main issue. The author's friends are being judgmental. The author tried to make a point, which could be seen as fair. So probably the answer is B.\n"
