Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after a series of events involving a guy asking her weight and her responding by asking about his penis size.\n\nFirst, the guy asked how much she weighs. Weight can be a sensitive topic, and the user felt uncomfortable. She answered, but then he made a comment about her weight compared to his, which made her feel he was calling her fat. She confronted him, and he made a defensive comment about double standards. She then asked about his penis size, which made him embarrassed, and his friends called her an overreacting bitch.\n\nI need to assess if her response was appropriate. The guy's initial question about weight was intrusive, and his follow-up comments were dismissive and possibly hurtful. The user's reaction was to mirror his behavior by asking a personal question about his insecurities. While using his own insecurities to make him see her point might be a tactic, it's important to consider whether that's a fair approach.\n\nIn terms of social norms, both weight and penis size are sensitive topics. The guy initiated the personal question, which caused discomfort. The user's response could be seen as a form of retaliation to make him understand her feelings. However, some might argue that she escalated the situation by bringing up another sensitive topic, even if it was to highlight a double standard.\n\nThe friends' reactions suggest they see her as the asshole because she used his known insecurity against him, implying she knew how it would make him feel. But the user's main issue was the initial invasion of privacy and the harsh comment. Her response might be a way to assert boundaries, but it's a bit of a tit-for-tat approach.\n\nLegally and ethically, there's no right or wrong, but socially, the dynamics are tricky. The guy started by asking a personal question that made her uncomfortable. She felt attacked and tried to show him the same treatment. While it's a common technique in arguments to put the other person in the same position, it's not always effective and can be seen as underhanded. However, if the guy was truly being insensitive, her response could be a way to teach him empathy.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If she knew he was insecure about his size and used that to make him feel embarrassed, that could be seen as exploiting his vulnerability. On the other hand, if he was being dismissive and making her uncomfortable first, her response might be a justified attempt to hold him accountable. The friends' reactions might be biased since they're on his side.\n\nIn conclusion, the situation involves both parties acting from their own insecurities. The user's response was a direct challenge to his behavior, which might be seen as fair in a way, but using his insecurity against him without his knowledge could be considered underhanded. However, given that he initiated the intrusive question and made a harsh comment, her response might be a way to set a boundary. So, the answer could be a bit situational, but I'm leaning towards her not being in the wrong because she was responding to his initial intrusion and harshness.\n"
