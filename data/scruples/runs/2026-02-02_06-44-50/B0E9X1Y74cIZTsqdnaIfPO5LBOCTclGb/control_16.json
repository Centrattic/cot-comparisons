Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a guy asked her how much she weighs, which made her uncomfortable. She then asked him about his dick size as a way to show him how his question made her feel. Now, her friends are saying she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy asked about her weight, which is a personal topic. Even if he didn't mean to be offensive, bringing up someone's weight can be sensitive. She felt uncomfortable and tried to handle it by telling him she didn't like the question. When he didn't apologize and made a comment about her weight, she responded by asking about his dick size. Her friends argue that she knew about his insecurity and used it against him.\n\nOn one hand, asking about someone's weight is a personal question and can be seen as intrusive. It's generally considered polite not to ask about someone's body unless they offer the information. The guy's comment about her weight also seems to minimize her feelings by stating she isn't \"morbidly fat,\" which might have come off as dismissive or even backhanded.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's response of asking about his dick size is a direct comparison to his insecurity. She used his known insecurity to highlight how his question made her feel. While that might be a clever way to make a point, some might see it as using his vulnerability against him. However, she did stop when he asked her to, so she didn't push it further.\n\nThe friends are saying she was overreacting because he didn't know about her insecurities, but he did know about his own. The key here is whether asking about weight is inherently more offensive than asking about genital size, even if both are personal. Cultural norms often allow for more leeway in certain topics, but both can be sensitive. The guy's initial question was the catalyst, so his actions might have been the first wrong, and her response was a reaction to that. However, retaliating with a personal question might not be the best approach, but it's also a form of showing empathy or understanding.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties might have missteps. He asked a personal question without considering the sensitivity. She responded in kind, which might have been a way to communicate her feelings. But societal expectations might differ on what's acceptable. The guy's defensiveness and lack of apology could be part of the issue too.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's action was a response to being made uncomfortable by a personal question. While her method might be seen as a bit sharp, it's a form of highlighting the double standard he mentioned. However, since she did stop when he asked and her intention was to show his own vulnerability, maybe she isn't entirely in the wrong. The friends' judgment that she's the asshole might stem from their own biases about the topics, but the initial question from the guy was the problem. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
