Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that this guy asked her how much she weighs after she commented on a female weightlifter's post. She felt uncomfortable and then responded by asking about his dick size. The guy didn't apologize, and her friends are saying she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and what's considered appropriate. Asking someone's weight can be very personal and potentially hurtful, especially since weight is a sensitive topic for many people. The guy's approach here might have been crossing a line, even if he didn't mean to be offensive. He followed up by making a comment about her not being morbidly fat, which could come off as dismissive or condescending. \n\nThen, the author, feeling that her boundaries were crossed, asked him about his insecurities regarding his dick size. This is a common tactic in arguments where people mirror the behavior of the other person to highlight the hypocrisy. By doing so, she's trying to show him that what he did to her is similar to what he might perceive as an insult if the situation were reversed. \n\nThe key points here are about consent and mutual respect. The guy initiated a personal question without considering her comfort. The author then used his own known insecurity to make a point. Whether this is justified depends on whether the author had a right to respond in kind. In some perspectives, using the same personal question is a form of holding the other accountable, but others might see it as escalating the conflict.\n\nThe friends' reaction suggests they think she overstepped, but their perspective might be influenced by the guy's side and the fact that he didn't apologize. However, the author's actions were a direct response to what she perceived as an invasion of privacy and an insensitive comment. \n\nI think the main issue is that the initial question from the guy was inappropriate, and the author's response, while maybe not the best approach, was an attempt to make him realize his mistake. Since the guy didn't apologize and the friends are judging her harshly, it's possible the author isn't in the wrong. Her actions were a reaction to his behavior, which was first. So, the answer might be B (No).\n"
