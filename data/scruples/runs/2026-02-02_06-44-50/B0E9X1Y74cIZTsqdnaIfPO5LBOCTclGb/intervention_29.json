Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person in the original situation) is in the wrong. They want to know if the author's response was justified.\n\nFirst, let's recap the situation. The guy asked the author's weight, which made her uncomfortable. She answered, and then he made a comment about her weighing more than him. She asked why he asked, and he gave a defense about it being a double standard. She then asked about his dick size to show his insecurity, which he found embarrassing. The author received messages from his friends calling her the asshole because she used his insecurity against him.\n\nSo, the key points here are mutual insecurities and the way they handled them. The guy asked a personal question (weight) which is sensitive for the author. She felt uncomfortable but answered, and then he made a comment that made her feel called out. She tried to mirror his insecurity about his size, which he didn't like, and others saw her as the asshole for doing that.\n\nNow, considering social norms: asking someone's weight is generally considered a personal or sensitive topic, especially for women. However, the guy might not have realized that. The author felt it was inappropriate, and he didn't apologize. Then she countered by asking about his insecurity, which he found embarrassing. His friends think she used his vulnerability against him, which is why they labeled her as the asshole.\n\nBut is she in the wrong? Well, she was the one who asked the question first. If he asked about her weight, which she found uncomfortable, and he didn't apologize, maybe she had a valid reason to want to point out the hypocrisy. However, using his insecurity in the same way might be seen as taking advantage. The friends' reactions suggest they see it that way. But the author's intention was to show him her perspective. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if someone is asked a personal question that makes them uncomfortable, they have the right to express that. However, when the author asked about his insecurities, it could be seen as retaliating and using his vulnerability. The guy didn't apologize, which is part of the issue. But the author's response might have been a way to highlight the double standard he mentioned. \n\nIn terms of social appropriateness, asking someone about their body size can be a sensitive topic for either gender. The guy's initial question was inappropriate, and the author's response was a way to show him the same. However, others might see the author's question as going too far because it's a private matter. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's response was an appropriate way to address the issue. If the guy was being insensitive by asking her weight and not apologizing, she might feel justified in pointing out the double standard. But using his specific insecurity in a public or confrontational way might be seen as taking it too far, hence why his friends called her the asshole. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because she took his personal insecurity and used it against him, even if her intention was to show him her perspective. However, others might argue she was standing up for herself. It's a bit of a gray area, but based on the friends' reactions and the general social norms, the answer is likely A.\n"
