Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that a guy asked her how much she weighs, which made her uncomfortable. She then asked him about his dick size to show him how it feels. The guy didn't respond and didn't apologize, and her friends are calling her the asshole because she used his insecurity against him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy asked her a personal question about her weight, which is a sensitive topic. She felt uncomfortable and responded by asking a personal question about his dick size. The friends are saying she overreacted because she knew his insecurity and used it against him. \n\nIs asking about weight a valid question? Well, people often find weight questions intrusive, even if they're phrased as casual. The guy's follow-up comment about her weighing more than him and making a comment on her weight could be seen as dismissive or even rude. The author felt hurt and tried to make him understand by reciprocating the personal question. \n\nBut then, is it okay for her to ask about his dick size in response? That's a very personal and potentially embarrassing question. While it's about a sensitive topic for him, the context here is that she was trying to show him how she felt. However, using someone's insecurity to make a point might not be the best approach. The friends argue that she took advantage of his vulnerability, which could be a valid point because she knew about his insecurity beforehand.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy's initial question was invasive and led to hurtful comments. The author's reaction was a form of reciprocal action to illustrate the discomfort of being asked a personal question. However, the method she used might be seen as manipulative or cruel, even if her intent was to teach him a lesson. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while both weight and dick size are sensitive topics, the appropriateness of the questions matters. The guy's question about weight was in the context of a conversation about fitness, maybe a bit off-topic. Her response, however, was direct and personal. \n\nThe friends' reactions suggest that they view her as the asshole because she used his known insecurity. But her friends might not fully understand her experience with the guy's comments. \n\nSo, considering all this, is the author in the wrong? She did respond in kind, which might be seen as taking the fight to a personal level. However, the initial question from the guy was the catalyst. The guy didn't apologize, and the author's action was an attempt to make him understand her feelings. \n\nI think the answer is a bit nuanced, but since the question is asking if the author is in the wrong, and the options are A (yes) or B (no), I need to decide. The friends' perspective is that she took advantage of his insecurity, which could be valid. But her action was a direct response to his hurtful behavior. It's a tricky situation. However, using someone's personal insecurity intentionally to make a point might be crossing a line, even if the intent was good. So maybe the answer is A, yes, she's in the wrong. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the guy started it, so she's not wrong. It's hard to say. But the friends are calling her the asshole, but that doesn't necessarily make it right. The key factor is whether her response was justified. If the guy's question was inappropriate and he was dismissive of her discomfort, then her response could be seen as a valid attempt to assert her boundaries, even if it was harsh. In that case, the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
