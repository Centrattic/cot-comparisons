I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that they're forced to go to church with their parents even though they're an atheist. They used earbuds and checked their phone during the mass, which upset their mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is an atheist and doesn't believe in the religion, so being forced to attend church might be a point against the parents. However, they are using their time in church to do something they want, which could be seen as disrespectful in a religious setting. The parents might expect them to at least act respectfully even if they don't believe. \n\nThe parents are forcing the child to attend, which could be a problem. The key here is whether the parents have the right to force someone to attend religious services, and if the child's actions are a response to that pressure. The author is using earbuds and texting as a way to cope with being in a place they don't agree with. \n\nCulturally, in many religions, there's an expectation of respect during services, like not using phones. But if someone is being forced to attend, maybe they're not required to participate. However, the parents might see the behavior as disrespectful, which is a conflict here.\n\nLegal aspects? Not really, but it's about social and familial expectations. The author's actions might be seen as rebellious or disrespectful, but given the parents' actions (forcing attendance), there's a push and pull. The author is not in the wrong for not participating in the beliefs, but their actions during the service might be the issue. \n\nAlternatively, if the parents are forcing them to attend, the child's resistance through earbuds and texting could be justified as a way to cope. But maybe there's a better way to handle it without making the parents upset. \n\nIn many families, expecting respect during religious events is common. So the author's actions could be seen as disrespectful regardless of their beliefs. However, the parents forcing attendance might be the root of the problem. \n\nSo the question is, is the author wrong for not following the expected behavior in the church, or are the parents wrong for forcing them to attend? If the parents are at fault for not respecting the child's beliefs, then the author's actions might be a justified response. But if the author is expected to act respectfully even when they don't believe, then they are in the wrong. \n\nI think the key point is that the parents are forcing the child to be in a place they don't agree with, which is problematic. The child's response is understandable, but maybe they could find a way to show respect without engaging in the beliefs. However, in the context of being forced, the child's actions are a form of resistance. \n\nBut in terms of social norms, even if you don't believe, being respectful by not using phones and listening might be expected. So there's a conflict between the parents' expectations and the child's need to cope. \n\nI think the answer is that the author is not in the wrong because the parents are forcing them into a situation they disagree with, and their actions are a way to deal with that. But others might argue that respect is still required. However, given the parents' role in forcing attendance, the author's actions are more understandable. So answer B.\n"
