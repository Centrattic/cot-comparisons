I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the person is an atheist forced to attend church with their parents, and they're using earbuds and texting friends during mass. The parents are upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and social norms. In many Christian churches, especially traditional ones, the mass is a sacred time where people are expected to be attentive and respectful. Even if someone doesn't believe, the social setting might demand outward respect. So the person's actions might be seen as disrespectful in that context. \n\nBut then, the parents are forcing them to attend, which the person is against. The person has communicated their lack of belief, but the parents ignore it. So is the person wrong to express their dislike by using earbuds and texting? It's a conflict between personal autonomy and family expectations. \n\nAlso, the parents are criticizing the person's attitude. The person is disengaged because they don't agree with the beliefs. But in a family setting, maybe there's an expectation to participate respectfully even if you don't believe. However, if the family is forcing attendance, the person might feel they have a right to be disengaged in a setting they don't support. \n\nLegally, there's no wrongdoing, but socially and morally, it's tricky. Some might say the person is being disrespectful to the parents' beliefs and the religious context. Others might side with the person, arguing that they're being forced into an environment they disagree with and have the right to be disengaged. \n\nThe person's actions could be seen as rude because they're not respecting the space others are using for worship. On the other hand, the parents forcing attendance without considering the child's beliefs is also an issue. \n\nSo which takes precedence? The answer might depend on cultural norms and personal values. If the answer is that the person is wrong, it's because they're not respecting the parents' wishes and the religious setting. If not, it's because the parents are forcing them into an uncomfortable situation. \n\nI think the key points are the forced attendance and the social expectations of the church. The person might be in the wrong for not respecting the parents' choice to attend, even if they disagree. But the parents are also at fault for not respecting the child's beliefs. However, the question is specifically about the person in the scenario. So maybe the answer is A (yes, they're in the wrong) because they're being disrespectful in a setting where the parents expect engagement, even if their own beliefs are different. Alternatively, if the parents are the ones forcing it, maybe the person isn't at fault. \n\nHmm. I'm a bit torn. But I think in many contexts, attending a religious service with the family and being visibly disengaged (like using earbuds and texting) is considered disrespectful. So the answer might lean towards A.\n"
