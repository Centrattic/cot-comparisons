I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a person being forced to attend church by their parents, even though they're an atheist. The person used earbuds and checked their phone during the service, which annoyed their mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is an atheist and has communicated that to their parents, but they're still forced to attend. The parents are insisting on their tradition, which the child is uncomfortable with. The author's actions (listening to music and texting) are a form of resistance against being forced into an activity they don't believe in. \n\nFrom a religious or traditional standpoint, being in church might require a certain level of respect, like not using phones. But the author is in a situation where they feel disrespected because they're being forced to participate. Their actions could be seen as disrespectful to the religious setting, but also as a stand against being forced to endure something they disagree with. \n\nThe parents' response is to criticize the attitude, but the root issue is the lack of autonomy. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Legally or ethically, forcing someone to attend religious services can be problematic, especially for an adult. The author's actions are a personal choice in that context. However, in a public or family setting, there's a balance between personal freedom and social norms. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions are disrespectful or if they're justified in resisting forced attendance. If the parents are forcing the author to attend, the author's response is understandable. But in the specific act of using earbuds and a phone during a religious service, that might be seen as disrespectful in that environment. But since the author isn't there by choice, their actions can be viewed as a form of protest. \n\nI think the key here is the parents forcing attendance. If the author had chosen to attend, then using a phone might be wrong. But since it's forced, the author is in a dilemma. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because the author is resisting an imposition, and their actions are a form of expressing their discomfort and independence.\n"
