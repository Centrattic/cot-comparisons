I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is an atheist being forced to attend church by their parents. They used earbuds and texted during the mass, and their mom gave them dirty looks and criticized their attitude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents are forcing their child to attend church, which the child doesn't believe in. The child is an adult, I assume, since they're making their own choices. The parents are not respecting the child's beliefs and are forcing them into a place of worship they don't agree with. The child is reacting by disengaging from the service, which is understandable given the circumstances.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, being forced to attend religious services can be seen as a form of pressure, especially if the individual doesn't share the beliefs. The child's actions\u2014listening to music and texting\u2014are a way to cope with being in an environment they find uncomfortable or meaningless. The parents' reaction, giving dirty looks and criticizing the child's attitude, seems harsh, especially since they are the ones forcing the child to be there in the first place.\n\nHowever, there's a cultural aspect to consider. In some religious communities, using earbuds or phones during a service might be seen as disrespectful, regardless of the individual's personal beliefs. The parents might view the child's actions as a lack of respect for the church, the service, and their own beliefs. But the root issue is the parents' insistence on making the child attend, which could be the main problem here.\n\nThe question is whether the child is in the wrong. If the parents are forcing them to attend, the child's disengagement is a reaction to being forced into a situation they don't agree with. The parents are at fault for not respecting the child's autonomy and beliefs. The child's actions, while perhaps seen as disrespectful in a cultural context, are a result of the parents' actions. Therefore, the child isn't in the wrong.\n"
