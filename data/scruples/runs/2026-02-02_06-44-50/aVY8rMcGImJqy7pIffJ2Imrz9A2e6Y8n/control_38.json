I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that they're an atheist forced to go to church with their parents, and they're using earbuds and texting during mass. Their mom is upset, calling them negative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is being forced to attend a religious service they don't believe in. They've communicated their lack of belief multiple times. The parents are insisting they come anyway. The author's response is to listen to music and text friends. \n\nNow, the question is whether they're in the wrong. From a religious perspective, disrupting or not participating in a service might be seen as disrespectful. But the author isn't trying to disrupt; they're just coping with an unwanted situation. They're not causing a scene, just using earbuds and texting. \n\nAlso, the parents are the ones enforcing attendance despite the child's beliefs. The author's actions are a form of passive resistance, not active disrespect. The parents might view it as disrespectful, but the root issue is the forced participation. \n\nIn terms of ethics, respecting someone's autonomy and their beliefs is important. The parents aren't respecting the child's autonomy by forcing them to attend. The child's actions are a way to manage their own discomfort in a situation they're not compelled to be part of. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The parents are forcing them into a situation, so the child's actions are a reaction to that. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
