I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is that the person is an atheist, forced to attend church with their parents, and they're using earbuds and texting during mass. The parents are upset, giving dirty looks and criticizing the attitude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is being forced to attend a religious service they don't believe in. They've communicated their lack of belief multiple times. The parents are insisting they come along. The author's response is to use earbuds and text friends. The key points here are consent, respect, and cultural expectations.\n\nFrom a parental perspective, they might see attending church as a family tradition or a moral duty, so they might expect participation. The author, however, feels coerced and uninterested, leading to their disengagement. The question is whether the author's actions are disrespectful or if the parents are overstepping.\n\nCulturally, in many religious settings, especially during a mass, there's an expectation of attentiveness and respect. Using earbuds and texting could be seen as disruptive or disrespectful. However, the author is there against their will, which complicates things. They're not participating in the religious aspects but are present because forced by parents.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, even if they don't believe, being present in a religious setting might require some level of respect for the environment, regardless of personal beliefs. Texting and listening to music could be seen as showing disrespect towards the parents' beliefs and the setting. However, the parents forcing attendance might be the root issue here. The author is reacting to being forced to attend something they find meaningless.\n\nThe parents might have the right to want family traditions, but forcing a child to attend a service they're uncomfortable with could be oppressive. The author's actions might be a form of resistance. However, the way they're resisting (using earbuds and texting) could be seen as disrespectful. It's a balance between the parents' wishes and the child's autonomy.\n\nIn some cultures, attending religious services is a family affair, and disengaging during the service might be frowned upon. But the author is clear about their atheism and has tried to communicate that. The parents not listening might be the bigger issue here. The author's actions are a result of being forced into a situation they don't agree with. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? They might not be in the wrong for disengaging if they're forced there, but their method could be seen as disrespectful. However, the parents' insistence on forcing attendance despite the child's clear discomfort is problematic. The answer might depend on whether the focus is on the author's respect for the setting or the parents' infringement on the child's autonomy. Given the options, the answer might be B (author not in the wrong) because the parents forced attendance, and the author is reacting to that coercion, but there's nuance here.\n"
