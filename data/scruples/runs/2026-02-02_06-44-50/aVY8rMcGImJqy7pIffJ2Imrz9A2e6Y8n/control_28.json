I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the person is forced to go to church by their parents despite being an atheist. They start using earbuds and texting during the service, which upsets their mom. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user is an atheist and doesn't believe in their parents' religion. They've communicated this multiple times but are still forced to attend. That seems like a problem of parental pressure, maybe even coercion. The parents are making them go to a religious event they don't agree with, which could be a form of disrespect towards the child's beliefs. \n\nThen, the user's actions: wearing earbuds and checking their phone. In a church setting, especially during a mass, people generally expect attendees to be respectful and attentive. Using earbuds might be seen as disrespectful because it's a place for communal worship and reflection. Texting during the service would likely be considered inconsiderate, as it's a distraction and shows a lack of respect for the ceremony. \n\nBut the key point here is the forced attendance. If the user is being forced to attend against their will, does that change the perspective? The parents might see the church attendance as a family tradition or a moral duty, but the child is being coerced, which can create a conflict. The parents' approach of \"brushing off\" the child's beliefs and forcing participation might be the root issue. \n\nHowever, regardless of the reason, the act of using earbuds and texting during a religious service is generally seen as disrespectful in many cultures and religious contexts. Even if the person doesn't believe in the religion, being in a place of worship often expects a certain level of decorum. The parents might be right in feeling that the child's behavior is inappropriate for the setting, regardless of the child's personal beliefs. \n\nOn the other hand, the parents should respect their child's autonomy and beliefs. Forcing someone to attend a religious service they disagree with can be harmful and may not be the best approach. The child's actions could be a form of protest against the forced attendance, which adds another layer. If the parents are not respecting the child's beliefs, the child might feel justified in their behavior as a way to cope with the situation. \n\nBut from a social standpoint, the immediate issue is the behavior during the service. Even if the child is in a situation they dislike, the act of using earbuds and texting might still be considered inconsiderate. The parents have the right to expect their child to behave respectfully in a place they consider important. The child's actions could be seen as a breach of that respect, even if the underlying reason is being forced to attend. \n\nIn summary, while the parents' approach of forcing attendance is questionable, the author's actions during the service could be seen as inconsiderate. The key is whether the behavior is disrespectful regardless of the reason. So, the answer might depend on whether the focus is on the forced attendance or the behavior itself.\n"
