I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person is wrong for using earbuds and texting during church mass when they're forced to go despite being an atheist. The parents are making them attend, and the person is rebelling by listening to music and texting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is an atheist and doesn't believe in the religion, so attending church is against their beliefs. They've told their parents, but the parents still force them to come. The person is using earbuds and texting as a way to cope with the situation. \n\nNow, the parents' actions are questionable. Forcing someone to attend religious services they don't believe in can be seen as oppressive. The child's response is a form of resistance. However, the act of using earbuds and texting during a religious service might be considered disrespectful in the context of that service, regardless of the person's beliefs. \n\nBut the key here is the coercion. The person is being forced into an environment where they are expected to participate. Their actions are a way to maintain their autonomy. From the parents' perspective, they might see it as disrespectful, but from the child's side, they're trying to handle a situation they're uncomfortable with. \n\nThe question is whether the person is in the wrong. The answer depends on whose rules are being broken. In the church setting, there are social norms about respecting the service. However, if the person is being forced to attend, their actions might be seen as a form of self-preservation. \n\nI think the parents are at fault for forcing their child to attend against their will, and the child's actions are a reasonable response to being in an unwanted situation. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
