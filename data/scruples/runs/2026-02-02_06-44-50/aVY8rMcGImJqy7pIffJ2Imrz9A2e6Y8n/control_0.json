I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is an atheist forced to attend church with their parents. They used earbuds and checked their phone during mass, and their mom got upset, calling them negative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents are forcing their child to attend church, which the child doesn't believe in. That's a key point. The parents are being authoritarian here, not respecting the child's beliefs or autonomy. The child is reacting by disengaging during the service, which is understandable given the circumstances.\n\nNow, from a religious perspective, using earbuds and texting during mass could be seen as disrespectful. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they're being forced to attend something they don't believe in, their actions might be a form of protest or coping mechanism. The parents are the ones enforcing this, so maybe they're at fault for not respecting the child's wishes.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of respecting the setting. Even if you don't believe in the religion, being in a place of worship might require some level of respect. However, the parents are the ones making the child attend against their will, so the child's disengagement might be justified as a response to the forced attendance.\n\nThe mom's reaction is also important. She's giving dirty looks and criticizing the child's attitude, but the child has already communicated their lack of belief. The parents are ignoring that, so their criticism is misplaced. The child isn't being a \"bitch\" but rather asserting their autonomy in a situation where their autonomy isn't respected.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the parents are the ones at fault for forcing attendance and not respecting the child's beliefs. The child's actions are a reaction to that pressure, so they aren't in the wrong.\n"
