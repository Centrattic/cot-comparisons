I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is an atheist forced to attend church with their parents. They wear earbuds and check their phone during mass, leading to their mom giving them dirty looks and criticizing their attitude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents are forcing the author to attend church despite the author's disbelief. The author is using earbuds and texting to cope with the discomfort. The parents are upset because of the perceived attitude.\n\nSo, is the author at fault? Well, from a religious perspective, in church, one is expected to be respectful and attentive. Using earbuds and texting might be seen as disrespectful. However, the author is being forced to attend against their beliefs, which adds context. The question is whether the parents' actions (forcing attendance) negate the author's responsibility to be respectful in that environment.\n\nOn one hand, the parents are enforcing their beliefs and expecting the child to participate, even though the child doesn't believe. On the other hand, the child is expressing disengagement through their actions. The parents' criticism of the child's attitude seems to ignore the child's lack of belief and the coercion involved.\n\nBut in terms of right and wrong, if we look at societal norms or religious expectations, the author might be seen as disrespectful. However, given the context of being forced to attend, there's a counterargument that the parents are at fault for not respecting the child's beliefs and autonomy. The author's actions could be a form of coping against an unwelcome environment.\n\nThe AITA community often looks at both sides. The parents are enforcing their beliefs without considering the child's autonomy, which is problematic. The author's response is a reaction to that pressure. While the actions during church might be seen as disrespectful in a religious context, the underlying issue is the parents' insistence on attending against the child's wishes.\n\nSo, maybe the answer isn't clear-cut. But the user is asking for a choice between A or B. If the question is whether the author is in the wrong, considering the parents' role in forcing attendance, perhaps the answer is B (not in the wrong). However, if the focus is strictly on the actions during church (using earbuds, texting), then A (in the wrong). But the parents' actions are part of the context. The AITA format often considers the situation holistically. The author's actions might be a response to being forced into a situation they don't believe in. Therefore, the parents are more at fault for not respecting the child's autonomy. So the answer would be B.\n"
