I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about someone who's an atheist being forced by their parents to attend church every Sunday. They're wearing earbuds, listening to music, and texting during the service. The parents are upset, especially the mom, who gave dirty looks and later criticized the attitude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is an atheist and doesn't believe in the religion they're attending. They've told their parents multiple times they don't believe, but the parents still force them to go. So, the author is in a situation where they're compelled to participate in a religious activity they don't agree with. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for using earbuds and texting during mass. From a religious perspective, church services are considered sacred times for worship and reflection. Distractions like listening to music or texting might be seen as disrespectful, especially in a space where others are there to pray. The author's actions could be viewed as dismissive of the environment, even if they don't share the beliefs.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the parents forcing their child to attend against their beliefs. The parents' actions might infringe on the child's autonomy and freedom of religion. The author's response could be seen as a way to cope with being in an uncomfortable, forced situation. However, the method they chose\u2014using earbuds and texting\u2014might be seen as inappropriate in that setting regardless of their reasons.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to their beliefs and might feel the situation is unjust. On the other hand, they're in a place where others are there for worship, and their actions could be seen as disrespectful to the congregation and the parents' beliefs. The parents are upset because they view the behavior as negative and disrespectful, which complicates the situation.\n\nI think the key points are the author's right to autonomy versus the expectations of the religious setting. While the parents are forcing the attendance, the author's actions in the church might still be considered disrespectful. So, even if the parents are wrong for forcing the attendance, the author's choice to act disrespectfully in that setting could make them partially at fault. However, if the parents are forcing the child to attend a religion they don't practice, that's a separate issue. The question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong for their behavior during mass. In that case, listening to music and texting could be seen as inconsiderate and disrespectful in a place meant for worship, so the answer might lean towards A.\n"
