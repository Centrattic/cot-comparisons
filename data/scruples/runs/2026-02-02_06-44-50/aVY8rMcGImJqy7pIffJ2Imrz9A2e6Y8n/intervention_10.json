I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is an atheist being forced to attend church with their parents. They wear earbuds and check their phone during mass, which upsets their mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents are forcing the author to attend church, even though they're an atheist. The author has communicated their lack of belief multiple times. The parents ignore this and still take them. So the author is in a situation where they're being compelled to participate in a religious activity they don't believe in.\n\nNow, the author's actions: using earbuds to listen to music and texting during mass. From the parents' perspective, this might be seen as disrespectful. Churches often expect attendees to be attentive during services, so the parents might feel the author isn't showing respect. But the author is there against their will and is using the time to do something they find more meaningful (listening to music, socializing). \n\nLegally, there's no wrong here. The author isn't breaking any laws. Morally, it's more complex. In a religious setting, expectations of behavior can vary. If the author's actions are seen as disrespectful by the parents, maybe they could have chosen a different way to cope. For example, maybe listening to music quietly without visible earbuds, or not texting during the service. But the author's perspective is that they're being forced into a situation they don't agree with, so their actions might be a form of protest or coping.\n\nThe parents are at fault for forcing the author to attend, which is a problem. However, the author's choice to use earbuds and phone during the service might be seen as disrespectful in that context. But since the parents are the ones forcing the attendance, the author's actions could be a reasonable way to handle the situation. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be in the wrong if they should respect the setting they're in, regardless of their beliefs. Even if they don't believe, being in a church during a mass might require some level of decorum. But the parents are forcing them, so the author isn't there by choice. It's a tough balance between respecting the parents' wishes and the author's autonomy.\n\nThe key points: the parents are forcing attendance, the author is an atheist, and their actions in the church are a response to that coercion. The parents are likely at fault for not respecting the author's beliefs. The author's actions, while perhaps disrespectful in a religious context, are a reaction to being forced into a situation they find objectionable. So maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. However, they could have chosen a less disruptive way to handle it. But given the context, the parents are more at fault.\n"
