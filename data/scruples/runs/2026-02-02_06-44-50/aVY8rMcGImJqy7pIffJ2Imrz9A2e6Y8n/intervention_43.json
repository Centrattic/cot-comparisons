I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong. So the situation is that they're an atheist being forced to attend church with their parents who have recently become more religious. The author is wearing earbuds and texting during mass, and their mom is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions they were forced to attend church, which might be a key point. If the parents are making them go, maybe the author feels it's a violation of their beliefs. But then, they're choosing to use earbuds and text. Even if they don't believe, maybe there's an expectation of respect for the environment, even if they don't share the beliefs. Like, even in a place they don't agree with, maybe being disruptive or showing disinterest could be seen as rude.\n\nThe parents' perspective: they want to practice their religion and bring the whole family along. The author has communicated that they don't believe, but the parents still force them. The author's response is to disengage with music and texting. The mom's reaction is about the attitude, not necessarily the religious aspect. So maybe the parents feel disrespected, even if the child isn't religious. \n\nIs it wrong to not show respect in a religious setting if you don't believe? That's debatable. Some might say you can attend out of respect for the parents without engaging in the practices, but using earbuds and texting could be seen as disrespectful. Others might say if you're forced to go, you have the right to make the time more bearable without causing a scene.\n\nAlso, the author's actions could be a form of passive resistance. But from the parents' side, they might expect the child to at least pretend to be respectful. The mom's comment about having a negative attitude suggests she sees the behavior as disrespectful. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the parents are forcing them to attend, maybe the parents have some responsibility here. But the author's actions during the service could be seen as disrespectful regardless of the parents' actions. It's a bit of a gray area. The author might not be entirely wrong, but their actions could be considered disrespectful in the context of attending a family event, even if they don't share the beliefs. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
