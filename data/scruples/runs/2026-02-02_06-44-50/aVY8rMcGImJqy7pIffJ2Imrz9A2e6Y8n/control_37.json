I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about an atheist being forced to attend a church mass with their parents and deciding to wear earbuds and text during the service. The parents are upset, saying the child has a negative attitude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user is an atheist and doesn't believe in the religion their parents follow. They've communicated their lack of belief multiple times but are still forced to attend church. That's a key point because it shows the child is under pressure from their parents. \n\nThe action taken is wearing earbuds and texting. Wearing earbuds to block out the service makes sense if they don't want to participate, but in a religious setting, that might be seen as disrespectful. However, the parents are forcing them to attend, so the child's resistance might be a way to cope. \n\nFrom the parents' perspective, they expect family members to attend church together, and the child's behavior during the service is causing tension. They might feel that the child is being disrespectful or ungrateful, hence the dirty looks and the comment about having a negative attitude.\n\nLegally or ethically, there's no law against wearing earbuds in a church, but in many cultural or religious contexts, using earbuds or phones during a service is considered disrespectful. However, the child's right to their own beliefs and the pressure from parents to conform to their religious practices is a significant factor here.\n\nThe parents are forcing attendance, which could be seen as infringing on the child's autonomy, especially since the child has made their atheism clear. The child's actions might be a form of protest against being forced into an environment they find uncomfortable or conflicting with their beliefs.\n\nOn the other hand, the child could be seen as not respecting the parents' wishes or the environment they're in. But given that the child is not the one initiating the attendance and is being compelled against their will, their response might be justified as a way to maintain their own comfort and beliefs.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the parents are forcing the child into a situation they don't believe in, and the child is trying to cope in their own way. While the child's actions might be seen as disrespectful in a religious context, the root issue is the parents' insistence on mandatory attendance despite the child's expressed disinterest. Therefore, the fault isn't solely on the child. The answer might lean towards the child not being in the wrong because the parents are forcing them into a situation where they feel compelled to act in a way they find tolerable.\n"
