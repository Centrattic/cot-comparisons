I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's see. They're an atheist, forced to go to church by their parents. They wear earbuds and text during mass. The mom gets upset, says they have a negative attitude. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author is being forced to attend church. They've told their parents they're an atheist and don't believe, but the parents don't listen. So the author is trying to cope by listening to music and texting. Is that appropriate?\n\nFrom the author's perspective, being forced to attend a religious event that they don't believe in is a problem. They might feel it's a violation of their personal beliefs. Using earbuds and texting could be their way of dealing with the anxiety or discomfort of being in a place where they don't belong. They might not see it as disrespectful because they don't hold the same beliefs as the church.\n\nOn the other hand, from the parents' side, they might see the church as a sacred place where everyone should be respectful. Even if the author is an atheist, the act of being in church might require a certain decorum. Wearing earbuds and texting could be seen as disrespectful, not just to the parents but to the religious environment. The parents might feel that the author is showing a lack of respect for their beliefs and the traditions of the church.\n\nLegally and ethically, in some places, there might be laws about minors being forced to attend religious services, but that's more of a separate issue. The main question here is about personal responsibility and respect. The author is an adult, or at least a teenager if they're in a situation where they're going with their parents. If they're an adult, they might have more autonomy. If they're a minor, their parents have more authority, but that doesn't mean the child can't express their discomfort.\n\nThe key points are respect and the parents' expectations. Even if the author doesn't believe, being in a place where others are trying to worship might require some level of respect. However, the parents forcing them to attend without considering their feelings is also problematic. The author's actions might be seen as disrespectful by others in the church, but the parents' insistence on forcing attendance is also an issue.\n\nI think the author is in the wrong because they are in a setting that others consider important and are choosing to engage in behavior that's disrespectful to that setting, regardless of their personal beliefs. But the parents also have some fault for forcing attendance. However, the question is specifically about the author's actions. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they could have found a more respectful way to cope, like sitting quietly or listening to music without the earbuds being visible. Texting during mass is generally discouraged even in secular settings, but in a religious context, it's more about respect.\n"
