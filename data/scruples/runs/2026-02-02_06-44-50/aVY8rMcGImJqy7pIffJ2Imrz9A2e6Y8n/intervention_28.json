I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is an atheist who's forced to attend church with their parents. They're using earbuds and texting during mass. The parents are upset because of their behavior.\n\nFirst, the author is being dragged to church against their will. They've expressed their lack of belief before. Using earbuds and texting is probably seen as disrespectful in a religious setting. But the parents are forcing them to attend, which is an issue. So there's a conflict between the parents' expectations and the child's comfort.\n\nThe author might feel frustrated and disrespected, leading them to act out. However, even if they're uncomfortable, their actions during the service could be seen as rude. Parents might expect some level of respect regardless of personal beliefs. But forcing a child to attend a place where they don't believe could also be problematic.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Maybe partially. They could have communicated their discomfort better or found another way to handle it without distracting themselves with their phone. On the other hand, the parents are forcing them to attend, which is a problem too. So maybe the fault isn't entirely on one side. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they're in a place they don't agree with, but their actions are disrespectful, it's a bit of both. But the answer options are A or B. The user says they think the author is in the wrong. I need to decide. Considering social norms, even in a place of worship, if you're there, you should be respectful. So A might be the answer. But the parents are forcing them, which complicates it. Hmm.\n"
