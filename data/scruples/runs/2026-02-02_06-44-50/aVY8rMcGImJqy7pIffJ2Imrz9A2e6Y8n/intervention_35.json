I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a person being forced to attend church by their parents, even though they're an atheist. The author decided to wear earbuds and check their phone during the mass. Mom gave them dirty looks and criticized their attitude.\n\nFirst, the core issue is about respecting parents' wishes versus personal beliefs. The parents want to attend church, so they bring the author along. The author doesn't agree with the beliefs but is being forced to attend. The question is whether the author's actions are wrong.\n\nThe author's actions are listening to music and texting. In a church setting, which is typically a place of worship and quiet, such behavior could be seen as disrespectful. Even if the person doesn't believe, disrupting the service isn't considered respectful. The parents might see the behavior as rude or inconsiderate, especially since they're trying to participate in their religious practice.\n\nHowever, the parents are forcing the author to attend, which could be a problem. The author might feel they have no choice but to make the time bearable. But in public spaces like a church, there are social norms about behavior. Listening to music with earbuds might be acceptable, but texting during mass, especially in a visible way, could be seen as disruptive. \n\nAlso, the parents' response\u2014giving dirty looks and criticizing the author's attitude\u2014might be harsh. But the author's actions could have contributed to that reaction. The key here is whether the author's actions were disrespectful. If they were, then the author is in the wrong. If they were just trying to cope in a difficult situation without being disruptive, maybe not.\n\nBut in many religious contexts, even if you don't believe, being present without showing disrespect is expected. Texting and listening to music might cross that line. So the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong. But the parents forcing attendance is also an issue. However, the question specifically is about whether the author is in the wrong in their actions. So focusing on their behavior during the mass, the answer is likely A.\n"
