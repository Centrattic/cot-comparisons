I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a teenager forced to attend church with their parents, being an atheist. They used earbuds and texted a friend during the service, which upset their mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is an atheist, so they don't believe in the religion their parents follow. The parents are forcing them to attend church despite the child's beliefs and protests. The child is using earbuds and texting as a way to cope with the situation they find uncomfortable or unwanted.\n\nNow, looking at the parents' side. They might view attending church as important for family unity or religious observance. They might see the child's behavior as disrespectful, especially since they're in a place of worship. The child's actions of listening to music and texting could be seen as distracting or showing lack of respect in a sacred setting.\n\nBut the key point here is consent and autonomy. The child is being forced to attend, which might not be the best approach. Parents have the right to guide their children's upbringing, but if the child is an adult or old enough to make their own decisions, being forced could be an issue. However, in many cases, parents can set family expectations, even if the child disagrees.\n\nThe child's response is understandable given the pressure. However, acting out by using earbuds and texting might not be the best way to handle it. It could be seen as disrespectful in the context of the church service. The parents might feel that the child isn't adhering to family traditions or showing respect for their religious practices, even if the child doesn't share the beliefs.\n\nBut the parents are also at fault for not respecting the child's autonomy and beliefs. Forcing someone to attend religious services against their will can lead to resentment and conflict. The child's actions are a form of protest against that pressure. So, it's a mutual issue where both parties have valid points but are not fully respecting each other's perspectives.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the answer depends on cultural and family dynamics. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The parents are forcing the child to attend, which is a form of pressure. The child's actions are a reaction to that pressure. While the child's behavior might be seen as disrespectful in the context of the church, the root issue is the lack of mutual respect and understanding. Therefore, the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but the situation is complex. The parents are also at fault for not accommodating the child's beliefs more respectfully.\n"
