I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is an atheist forced to attend church with their parents. They wear earbuds and text during mass, which leads to their mom giving them dirty looks and criticizing their attitude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and familial context. In many religious settings, especially during a mass, there's an expectation of attentiveness and respect, regardless of one's personal beliefs. Wearing earbuds and using a phone might be seen as disrespectful because it's a communal activity where participants are expected to follow certain norms. The author is an adult, so they have the autonomy to refuse attending, but they're also part of a family tradition. However, the parents are forcing them to attend despite their atheism, which could be seen as controlling or dismissive of the author's beliefs.\n\nThe author's actions\u2014using earbuds and texting\u2014might be their way of coping with the situation since they find the mass unpleasant. But in a social context, especially in a religious gathering, such actions could be perceived as rude or inattentive. The parents might feel that the author isn't respecting their wishes or the event itself, leading to the mom's criticism about attitude.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents are forcing the author to attend a religious event that they don't believe in, which could be considered an imposition. The author might be asserting their personal boundaries by engaging in their own activities during the mass. However, even if the parents are at fault for forcing attendance, the author's response might still be seen as disrespectful in that specific setting.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. While the parents are definitely not respecting the author's beliefs by forcing them to attend, the author's actions during the mass could be considered disrespectful to the parents' beliefs and the event itself. The conflict arises from clashing values and expectations. The author might not be entirely wrong, but their actions do contribute to the tension. Therefore, they might share some responsibility.\n"
