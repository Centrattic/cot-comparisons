I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The user is asking if they are the asshole (AITA) for wearing earbuds and texting during a church service they were forced to attend, even though they're an atheist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is an atheist and doesn't believe in the religion their parents practice. They've told their parents multiple times they don't believe, but the parents still force them to attend. That's a key point. The parents are making them go to a place where they're expected to participate in a religion they don't believe in. \n\nNow, the person took earbuds and listened to music, and also texted a friend. From the parent's perspective, attending church together might be a family tradition or a way to practice their faith. They see their child being disrespectful, maybe even causing tension by not engaging. The mom's reaction with dirty looks and criticism suggests that she feels disrespected. \n\nBut from the child's perspective, they're being forced to attend a religious service they don't agree with. Using earbuds and texting is a way to cope with the situation. They might feel that since they're not there by choice, they need to pass the time as they see fit. Also, they've communicated their lack of belief before, so the parents might be ignoring their wishes, leading the child to act out.\n\nThe question is whether the child's actions are wrong. On one hand, the parents are forcing their child to attend a service they don't believe in, which could be seen as infringing on the child's autonomy. On the other hand, the child is reacting to being forced into an environment they find disagreeable by disengaging, which might be seen as disrespectful in that context. \n\nIn many religious settings, there's an expectation of attentiveness and respect during services. Using earbuds and texting could be seen as disrespectful not just to the parents but to the congregation. However, the parents are the ones enforcing attendance, which could be the root issue. \n\nBut the user's own opinion is that they think the author is in the wrong. They want to see if others agree. So I need to weigh whether the child's actions are disrespectful in a public setting versus the parents forcing them into a situation they're uncomfortable with. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong because they chose to disengage in a way that's disrespectful to the setting their parents value. Even if they're forced to attend, there are ways to be respectful without participating in the religious aspects, like sitting quietly. However, using earbuds and texting might be seen as showing contempt for the parents' wishes and the religious environment. The parents are at fault for forcing attendance, but the child's actions also contribute to the conflict. So the author might be in the wrong.\n"
