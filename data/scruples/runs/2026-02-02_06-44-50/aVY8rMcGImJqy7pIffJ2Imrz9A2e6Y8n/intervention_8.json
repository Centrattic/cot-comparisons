I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that they're forced to attend church by their parents despite being an atheist. They wear earbuds and check their phone during mass, which upsets their mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents are forcing the author to attend church, which the author doesn't believe in. The author is an atheist and has communicated that to the parents already. However, the parents still make them go. The author's response is to use earbuds and text a friend, leading to conflict with the mom.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the parents are making the author attend religious services against their beliefs. That's a form of coercion, which is problematic. The author's actions\u2014using earbuds and texting\u2014are their way of coping with an uncomfortable situation. But the parents see this as disrespectful, hence the dirty looks and criticism about attitude.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, parents can require their children to attend church, depending on the country, but ethically, it's a different matter. The author's actions are a form of non-compliance without outright defiance. They're not causing a scene but trying to pass time in a way that's acceptable to themselves. However, it's possible that the parents view this as disrespect towards the church and their values.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents' insistence on attending church against the child's beliefs could be seen as imposing their religion on someone else, which is ethically questionable. The author's behavior is a response to that pressure. However, the author's use of earbuds and texting might be seen as disrespectful in a religious setting, regardless of personal beliefs. The parents might feel that the author is not showing respect for the ceremony, even if they don't share the beliefs.\n\nBut the key point is that the author is being forced to attend a place where their presence is expected to be respectful. Even if they don't believe, they might be expected to at least act respectfully. So, wearing earbuds and texting could be seen as disrespectful behavior in that context. However, if the parents are forcing them to attend, the responsibility also lies with the parents for not respecting the author's beliefs and autonomy.\n\nIn terms of who is more in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The parents are forcing the author into a situation where the author feels compelled to act disrespectfully. But the author's actions could be seen as a way to assert their own autonomy. So maybe both parties have some fault here, but the question is specifically about the author.\n\nThe answer depends on the perspective. If we consider the parents' actions as the root issue, then the author isn't entirely in the wrong. But if the author's actions are objectively disrespectful regardless of their beliefs, then they might share some responsibility. However, since the parents are the ones forcing the author into the situation, the primary responsibility might lie with them. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
