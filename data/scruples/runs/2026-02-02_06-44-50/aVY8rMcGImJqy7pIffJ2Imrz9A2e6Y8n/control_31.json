I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person (AITA) is in the wrong for wearing earbuds and checking their phone during a church mass they're forced to attend, even though they're an atheist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is an atheist, so they don't believe in the religion their parents are practicing. They've been forced to attend church every Sunday, which they clearly don't want to do. They mention they've told their parents multiple times they don't believe, but the parents keep forcing them. The person's actions\u2014using earbuds and texting\u2014are about trying to cope with a situation they find unpleasant and are required to participate in.\n\nNow, the key here is whether the person is in the wrong. From a religious or cultural perspective, church is a sacred place with certain expectations of behavior, like not using phones or headphones. So, in that context, their actions might be seen as disrespectful. However, the person is there against their will and their beliefs. So there's a conflict between respecting the religious setting and the individual's right to not participate in something they disagree with.\n\nThe parents might be at fault for forcing their child to attend a service they don't believe in. In many places, children are not required to attend religious services unless it's part of a cultural or family tradition, but the parents have a responsibility to consider their child's well-being. However, the line between parental authority and a child's autonomy is tricky. If the child is an adult, the situation might be different, but the question doesn't specify the age. If the person is a minor, the parents might have more authority, but they could still be overstepping by forcing attendance against the child's beliefs.\n\nThe person's actions\u2014listening to music and texting\u2014could be seen as a form of protest or coping mechanism. But in the context of the church, they might be perceived as disrespectful, especially if the parents and congregation value active participation and respect during the service. The mom's reaction about having a negative attitude might be valid from the parents' perspective, but the root issue is the child being forced into a setting they find objectionable.\n\nI need to balance the respect for religious practices against the individual's right to not participate. If the person is being forced to attend, their actions might be a way to maintain their autonomy. However, from the parents' side, they might feel that attending the service together is important for family cohesion or their own beliefs.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, using earbuds and phones in church is generally frowned upon, regardless of the individual's beliefs. So, the person might be in the wrong for not respecting the setting, even if they are there against their will. But if the parents are forcing a non-believer to attend, that could be seen as the parents' fault for not respecting the child's beliefs.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whose perspective you take. The parents might be wrong for forcing attendance, and the child might be wrong for the actions in the church. However, given that the question is about the author's wrongness, the answer could be A (they are in the wrong) because they are disrupting the service and not respecting the setting, even if the parents are also at fault. But some might argue that the parents' actions are more at fault, so the author isn't wrong. It's a bit of a gray area. However, in most societal contexts, the expectation is to at least show some respect in a religious setting, even if you don't believe, so the author might be in the wrong.\n"
