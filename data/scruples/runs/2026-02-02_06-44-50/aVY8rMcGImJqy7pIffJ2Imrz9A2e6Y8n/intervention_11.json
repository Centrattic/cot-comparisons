I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that they're an atheist forced to go to church with their parents, and during the service, they use earbuds and text their friend. Their mom gives them dirty looks and criticizes their attitude. The person is asking if they're the one at fault.\n\nFirst, I should consider the parents' perspective. They believe in attending church and are including their child, maybe thinking it's a family tradition or important for their faith. They might feel that bringing the child is part of their role as parents, even if the child doesn't believe. However, the child has clearly communicated their disbelief and dislike for attending, so the parents might still be forcing them, which could be seen as disregarding the child's autonomy and feelings.\n\nNow, the child's actions: wearing earbuds and texting during the mass. In a church setting, especially if the family is attending regularly, there's an expectation of participation and respect. The church is a place where the family is practicing their faith, and the child's use of earbuds and phone might be seen as disrespectful or dismissive. Even if the child doesn't share the beliefs, being physically present often comes with social expectations to behave respectfully, not out of belief but out of courtesy.\n\nBut the child is an atheist and has expressed that they don't believe and dislike being there. So their actions could be a form of protest or coping mechanism. However, the question is about whether they're in the wrong. From a social standpoint, even in a place of worship, there's usually an expectation of not disrupting others. If the earbuds are loud or the texting is visible, it might disturb others. But if the volume is low and texting is discreet, maybe not. Still, the parents might view any disengagement as disrespectful, especially if they see the church as a family activity.\n\nThe key points here are respect for others' beliefs and social norms. Even if the child doesn't believe, they might still need to respect the family's religious practices during the time they're attending together. The parents, on the other hand, might need to respect the child's autonomy and not force them to attend if they're not comfortable. The child's actions could be seen as a way to handle the situation personally, but they might not consider how it affects the parents' feelings or the overall family dynamic.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of \"forced attendance.\" If the parents are making the child go against their will, that's a problem. However, once there, the child's behavior might be seen as a way to cope, but it's important to balance personal comfort with respect for the environment. If the child is being disruptive, then they might be at fault, but if they're just trying to pass the time without interfering with the service, maybe not.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the child's actions are disruptive and disrespectful. If they're using earbuds without disturbing others and texting discreetly, then maybe not. However, the fact that the mom is upset and the child is being criticized for their attitude suggests that the parents expect more participation or respect. Even without belief, showing respect for the family's wishes could be important in a family setting.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because their actions could be seen as disrespectful in a context where the family is practicing their faith together. Even if they don't share the beliefs, the social norm is to participate respectfully when attending as a family member. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
