I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about attending a church mass they don't believe in and using earbuds and texting during it. The parents are forcing them to go because they're religious, and the kid is doing these things to cope.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of both sides. The parents want their child to participate in their religious practices, which is common in many families. They might see attending mass as important for family unity or spiritual reasons. The child, being an atheist, doesn't believe and finds the experience unpleasant. Using earbuds and texting is their way of dealing with the situation, but the parents are upset by this.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, there's no issue here. Morally, it's more complex. In many cultures, showing respect for family traditions is valued. Disrespecting the setting (church) by using earbuds and texting could be seen as rude, especially in a place where people expect attention and participation. However, the child is being forced to attend against their beliefs, which could be seen as a form of coercion. \n\nThe parents might feel that the child's actions during mass are disrespectful, but the child's actions are a response to being forced to attend something they don't believe in. There's a balance between respecting family wishes and personal autonomy. The key points are consent and respect. If the child is forced to attend, their ability to fully respect the setting is compromised. However, using earbuds and texting is a form of disengagement that could be seen as disrespectful in that context.\n\nBut then again, the parents are the ones imposing the situation. If the child is in an environment they don't agree with, their actions are a way to cope. However, they could also choose to sit quietly or engage in respectful ways. Texting and listening to music might be seen as disruptive or disrespectful. The parents are upset because they want the child to participate respectfully, even if they don't believe. The child's behavior might be causing tension and hurt feelings.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the parents are forcing the child to attend, which might be the root issue. But the child's response could also be seen as not making an effort to be respectful. It's a bit of a both sides situation, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes), it's because the child is disrespectful despite being forced. If B (no), it's because the parents are forcing them into a situation they don't agree with, so the child's actions are a reaction to that.\n\nI think the answer might depend on cultural expectations. In some cultures, attending family religious events is expected regardless of personal beliefs, and disengaging is disrespectful. In others, personal autonomy is prioritized. The parents might see the child's behavior as disrespectful, but the child is acting out of discomfort. The author's actions are a form of protest against being forced into a belief system they don't have. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), because the parents are the ones forcing the situation, and the child is reacting to that. However, the act of using earbuds and texting could still be seen as disrespectful in a religious setting, regardless of their beliefs. It's a tough call, but considering the context of being forced, perhaps the author is not in the wrong. But I'm a bit conflicted here. Maybe the right answer is A because they're being disrespectful in a place where respect is expected, even if they don't agree. But then again, if they're forced, their ability to show respect is compromised. Hmm.\n"
