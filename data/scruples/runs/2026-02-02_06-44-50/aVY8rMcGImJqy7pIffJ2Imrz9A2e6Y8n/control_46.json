I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for wearing earbuds and texting during church when they're forced to go by their parents. They're an atheist and don't believe in their parents' religion. The parents started going to church recently and made the kid come along.\n\nSo first, the main points here. The parents are forcing their child to attend a religious service they don't believe in. That seems like a problem. The child is using earbuds and texting as a way to cope or show disinterest. The parents are upset about the behavior, but the kid is being forced into a situation they don't want to be in.\n\nNow, the question is whether the kid is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, if you're being forced to attend something you disagree with, it's understandable to want to pass the time in your own way. However, in a public setting like church, especially if it's a family event, others might see the earbuds and texting as disrespectful. But the root issue is the parents forcing attendance on their child who doesn't believe. That seems like the bigger problem here. The kid's actions are a response to being forced into an unwanted situation. So, maybe the parents are at fault for forcing the child to attend, making the kid's actions a form of passive resistance. But some might argue that the kid should respect the family's wishes even if they don't believe. But given that the kid has communicated their disbelief and is still forced to go, their actions are a way to cope. So the answer is probably B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because the parents are forcing them to attend something they don't believe in, and the kid's actions are a reasonable response to being put in that situation.\n"
