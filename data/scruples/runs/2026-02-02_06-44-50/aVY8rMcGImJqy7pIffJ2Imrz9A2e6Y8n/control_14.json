I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author being an atheist but forced to attend church with their parents. They used earbuds and checked their phone during the service, leading to their mom giving dirty looks and criticizing their attitude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is an atheist, so they don't believe in the religion their parents follow. They've told their parents multiple times about their disbelief, but the parents still make them attend. That's a key point\u2014compulsory attendance despite the child's beliefs. \n\nNow, the parents are enforcing their religious practices on the child. The author is using earbuds and texting to cope with the situation. The parents then criticize their attitude. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nFrom a standpoint of personal rights and autonomy, forcing someone to attend religious services against their will, especially when they don't believe, can be problematic. The parents might argue that they're upholding family traditions, but the child's right to express their beliefs (or lack thereof) is important. The author's actions\u2014listening to music and using their phone\u2014are ways to cope with an uncomfortable situation they're being forced into. \n\nHowever, culturally, in some religions, being physically present in services is considered respectful even if one doesn't believe. But the author is an atheist, so their perspective is different. The parents might see the use of earbuds and texting as disrespectful or disengaged, but from the author's perspective, it's a way to manage their time in a setting they find meaningless. \n\nThe parents' reaction is about the author's attitude, but the root issue is the forced attendance. The author isn't wrong for trying to make the best of a situation they're not choosing to be in. Plus, the parents haven't respected the author's expressed beliefs, which could be seen as the parents' fault. \n\nSo, the author's actions are a response to being forced into a practice they disagree with. The parents are forcing their child into something against their beliefs, which is more of the core issue. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
