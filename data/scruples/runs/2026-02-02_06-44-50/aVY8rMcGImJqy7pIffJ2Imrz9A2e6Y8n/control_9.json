I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person is an atheist but is forced to attend church with their parents every Sunday. They bring earbuds and listen to music, text a friend during the service, and their mom gives them dirty looks and criticizes their attitude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user is an atheist and doesn't believe in their parents' religion. They've tried to communicate their disbelief and dislike for attending church, but the parents are still making them go. The user is using earbuds and texting as a way to cope with the situation they find uncomfortable. \n\nNow, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. From a traditional or religious perspective, attending church is often seen as a communal activity where one is supposed to participate respectfully. Using earbuds and texting might be seen as disrespectful because they're not engaging in the service with the congregation. However, the user is in a position where they are forced to attend against their beliefs, which complicates things. \n\nLegally, parents can require their children to attend religious services if they are minors, depending on the country. But ethically, it's another matter. The user's actions could be a form of passive resistance against a situation they find oppressive. The parents, on the other hand, might view the behavior as disrespectful and a sign of a bad attitude, not realizing the underlying reason.\n\nSo, who's at fault? The user isn't necessarily wrong because they are under pressure from their parents and using the time to cope. However, their actions might be seen as disrespectful in the context of the church setting. But considering the coercion and the user's prior explanations about their disbelief, the fault might lie more with the parents for forcing attendance and not respecting the user's beliefs. The user's actions are a reaction to that pressure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user could have found a more respectful way to handle it, but given the circumstances, their actions are understandable. The key points are the coercion and the clash between personal belief and religious expectations. So, the answer might lean towards the user not being in the wrong because the parents are forcing them into a situation that conflicts with their beliefs, and the user is acting within their right to find a way to cope.\n"
