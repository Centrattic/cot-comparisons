I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author is an atheist forced to attend church by their parents. They used earbuds and checked their phone during the mass. The parents are upset, saying the author has a negative attitude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is being forced to attend church, which they don't believe in. They've communicated their disbelief multiple times, but the parents ignore it. The author's actions\u2014using earbuds and texting\u2014are forms of coping. From a religious perspective, church is a sacred space where distractions might be seen as disrespectful. However, the author's parents are forcing them to attend, which is a conflict of values. \n\nThe parents' argument is about respect and attitude, but the root issue is the forced attendance. The author isn't in the wrong for resisting a situation that's against their beliefs. However, maybe the method of resistance (using earbuds and texting) could be seen as disrespectful in that setting. But given the coercion, the author's actions are a form of passive resistance. \n\nOn the other hand, if the family is attending together, the author's behavior might disrupt the parents' experience. But the parents are the ones enforcing the attendance. The author's right to autonomy and freedom of belief might outweigh the parents' expectations in this case. So, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong because they're being forced into a situation they don't agree with. However, there's a cultural aspect where certain behaviors in church are expected, but that's more about the parents' perspective.\n"
