I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author going to church with their parents, even though they're an atheist. They wear earbuds and check their phone during the service, which makes their mom upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents are forcing the author to attend church, which they don't believe in. The author has communicated their atheism multiple times, but the parents still drag them along. The author uses earbuds to listen to music and texts a friend during the mass. The mom is upset, calling the author's attitude negative.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's autonomy, the parents' insistence despite the author's beliefs, and the author's response to being forced into a situation they disagree with. The question is about whether the author is wrong for their actions.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the parents are forcing the child to participate in religious activities against their beliefs. That's a form of coercion, which is problematic. The author's actions (using earbuds, texting) could be seen as a way to cope with or resist an imposed situation they find uncomfortable or meaningless. The parents, however, might view this as disrespectful, especially in a religious setting. But since the author isn't religious, the expectation of respect might not align with their perspective.\n\nIn some cultures, attending church together is a family tradition, and children are expected to participate. However, the author's right to personal beliefs and autonomy is important. The parents are not respecting the author's expressed views, which could be harmful in the long run. The author's actions might be a way to assert their independence in a situation where they feel forced into something they don't believe in.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of family dynamics. The author's behavior could be seen as disrespectful in the eyes of the parents, leading to conflict. However, if the parents are the ones forcing attendance, the author's response is a form of self-protection against that pressure. The question is whether the author is wrong for resisting coercion through passive means like using earbuds and texting.\n\nLegally and ethically, forcing someone to attend religious services could be a form of emotional coercion. The author's actions are a way to maintain their own comfort and mental health in a situation they find oppressive. So, the author might not be in the wrong because they're responding to an unjust situation. However, depending on cultural norms, the parents might see the behavior as disrespectful regardless of the author's reasons.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions are a reaction to being forced into an environment they find uncomfortable. While they might be seen as disrespectful in the context of the family's expectations, the parents are also at fault for not respecting the author's beliefs. The core issue is the parents' insistence on participation despite the author's clear objections. Therefore, the author's actions are a form of self-advocacy rather than being in the wrong.\n"
