So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they're an atheist forced to attend church with their parents, who have recently started going to church. The author is wearing earbuds and checking their phone during mass, which their mom disapproves of. The author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for doing this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents are forcing the author to attend church even though they don't believe. The author is an atheist, so they don't have any religious beliefs to begin with. The parents are ignoring the author's repeated statements about not believing. So the author is brought along against their will. In that situation, they're trying to cope by listening to music and texting friends. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. From the parents' perspective, they're taking their child to church, which they see as a family activity or a religious duty. They might view the author's behavior as disrespectful, especially during a service. The mom's dirty looks and comments about the author's attitude suggest she's upset. But from the author's side, they're being forced to attend something they don't believe in and are trying to make the time more bearable by engaging with their own interests. \n\nIs it the author's fault? Well, the parents are forcing them to attend, so the author is in a position where they have no choice. If they're being forced to be there, it's understandable they might try to pass the time. However, in a religious setting, even if you don't share the beliefs, there's an expectation of certain behavior, like not using phones or headphones. The author might be seen as being disrespectful to the environment and the parents' beliefs. But the parents are also forcing them to attend, which could be a bigger issue. \n\nSo is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, they're in a situation they didn't choose, and the parents are the ones making them attend. On the other hand, the author's actions during the service could be seen as disrespectful to the parents' beliefs and the setting. However, since the author is being forced to attend against their beliefs, their reaction might be justified. The parents have a responsibility to respect their child's beliefs and not force them into activities they find objectionable. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, being in a place of worship usually expects a certain level of decorum. The author's actions might be seen as violating that, but the parents are also at fault for not respecting the author's autonomy. So maybe both sides have some responsibility here. But the question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong. If the parents are forcing the author to attend, the author's actions are a response to that. So perhaps the author isn't in the wrong, because they're reacting to being forced into a situation they don't want to be in. The parents are the ones who are not respecting the author's beliefs by forcing them to attend. Therefore, the answer might be B (No).\n"
