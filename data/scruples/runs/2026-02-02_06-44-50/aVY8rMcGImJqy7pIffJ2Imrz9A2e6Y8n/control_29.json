I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they're an atheist being forced to attend church with their parents. They brought earbuds and listened to music, also texting a friend. Their mom gave them dirty looks and said they have a negative attitude. The user is asking if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, the parents are making the kid go to church even though they don't believe. The kid has clearly communicated their atheism, but the parents ignore it. So the parents are forcing participation in a religious activity that the child doesn't agree with. That's a problem. The parents might be overstepping here, especially if the child is an adult. But if the child is a minor, parents have some authority, but that's a different angle.\n\nThe kid responds by using earbuds and texting. Is that disrespectful? Well, in a church setting, people usually expect attendees to be attentive and respectful. Using earbuds might be seen as ignoring the service, which could be considered rude. But the kid is there against their will. The parents forced them to go, so the kid is in a bind. They might feel justified in trying to make the time pass more enjoyably, but from the parents' perspective, it's disrespectful.\n\nThe mom's reaction is to say the kid has a negative attitude. The kid is being forced to attend something they dislike, so their attitude isn't really the issue. The parents' insistence on forcing attendance without respecting the kid's beliefs is the core problem. The kid's actions are a form of passive resistance or coping mechanism. However, in a public setting like church, even if you're forced to attend, there's an expectation of decorum. But the parents are the ones creating the conflict by not respecting the kid's beliefs.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? If they're an adult, they might have the right to choose, but if they're a minor, they might be expected to comply with parental decisions, which is complicated. But the parents are the ones forcing the attendance, which is problematic. The author's actions could be seen as a reasonable response to being forced into an environment they don't respect. But in terms of respect for the setting, maybe they should have found another way to cope without using earbuds and texting, which might disrupt others or be seen as disrespectful. But the main issue is the parents' actions. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong because the parents are forcing attendance and not respecting the child's beliefs.\n"
