I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using earbuds and texting during a church mass they're forced to attend. The key points here are the author's reasons, the parents' actions, and the cultural context of attending church.\n\nFirst, the author is an atheist, which means they don't believe in the religion their parents are practicing. They've communicated their lack of belief, but the parents are forcing them to attend. This raises the issue of parental authority versus personal autonomy. If the parents are forcing the child to attend, then the child's actions might be seen as a form of resistance against something they find meaningless. However, in many cultures, showing respect in such settings is important, even if one doesn't share the beliefs.\n\nNext, the specific actions: wearing earbuds and checking the phone. In a church setting, especially during a mass, it's generally expected that attendees participate respectfully. Using earbuds to listen to secular music could be seen as disrespectful to those around them who are trying to worship. Similarly, texting during the service might be viewed as distracted and impolite. The mother's reaction, with dirty looks and criticism, suggests that the family values respect for the church environment, even if the child doesn't share the beliefs.\n\nBut the author is being forced to attend, which complicates things. They're not going by choice, so their participation is coerced. In such a case, the child might feel that their actions are justified as a way to cope with an uncomfortable situation. However, even if forced to attend, the expectation in most social settings is to maintain a respectful demeanor to avoid disrupting others or being rude.\n\nAnother angle is the parents' role. If they insist on attending church, they might also be responsible for explaining the reasons behind their choice and respecting the child's boundaries. However, the parents here seem to dismiss the child's beliefs and continue forcing attendance, which is problematic. That said, the child's behavior during the service still has the potential to be seen as disrespectful, regardless of their personal beliefs.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They might not be entirely wrong, given the forced attendance and their lack of belief. But from a social etiquette perspective, their actions could be seen as disrespectful. The answer hinges on whether one prioritizes the child's autonomy and the parents' enforcement of religious practices versus social norms of respect in communal settings. Considering all factors, I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong, because respectful behavior is expected in such environments, even if they don't share the beliefs.\n"
