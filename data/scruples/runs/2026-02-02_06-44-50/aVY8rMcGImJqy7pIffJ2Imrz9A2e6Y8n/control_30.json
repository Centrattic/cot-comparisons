I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a teenager being forced to attend church with their parents, despite being an atheist. The author admits to wearing earbuds and texting during the service, which led to their mom giving them dirty looks and criticizing their attitude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents are making the child attend church, which the child doesn't believe in. The child has communicated their lack of belief multiple times but is still forced to go. The response from the parents is to criticize the child's attitude instead of respecting their beliefs. \n\nThe key points are about autonomy and respect. The parents are imposing their religious practices on the child without considering the child's feelings or beliefs. The child's actions\u2014listening to music and texting\u2014could be seen as defiant, but they might also be a way to cope with being in an uncomfortable or unwanted situation. \n\nHowever, the parents' approach of forcing attendance might be problematic. If the child is not allowed to opt out, then their actions during the service could be a reaction to that pressure. The parents' criticism of the child's attitude without addressing their own actions (forcing attendance) seems to shift the blame unfairly.\n\nSo, is the child at fault? Well, they are following their parents' rules by attending, but they're using earbuds and texting to pass the time. While that could be seen as disrespectful in a religious setting, the root issue is the parents forcing attendance against the child's beliefs. The parents have a responsibility to respect their child's autonomy, especially regarding religious practices. \n\nIn many contexts, parents do have the right to raise their children in a certain religion, but forcing them to attend services when the child is an adult or old enough to form their own beliefs might cross a line. The child's actions might be a form of passive resistance. However, in a family dynamic, the parents' authority might be expected to be respected, even if the child disagrees.\n\nBut considering the parents are ignoring the child's expressed beliefs and continuing to force participation, that's where the parents might be at fault. The child's behavior could be a consequence of that pressure. Therefore, the main issue lies with the parents not respecting the child's autonomy, not the child for trying to manage their own discomfort in the situation.\n"
