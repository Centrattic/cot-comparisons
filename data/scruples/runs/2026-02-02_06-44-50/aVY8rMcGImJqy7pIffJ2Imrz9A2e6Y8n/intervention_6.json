I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author, an atheist, being forced to attend church with their parents. They listen to music and text friends during the service, leading to their mom criticizing them for having a negative attitude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is an atheist, so they don't believe in the religion of the church they're attending. Their parents are making them go every Sunday, which the author clearly doesn't want to do. As a result, they use earbuds and text friends to pass the time. Now, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for these actions.\n\nOn one hand, the author is being respectful in their own way. Since they don't believe, they might find the service boring or meaningless. Using earbuds to avoid being distracted by the service could be seen as a way to cope. Texting friends might be a way to keep themselves occupied, but that could be disruptive depending on how they're doing it. However, in a church setting, there's usually an expectation to be quiet and attentive, even if you don't believe. So, texting during a formal event where people expect silence might be considered disrespectful or rude.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's parents are forcing them to attend a place of worship they don't agree with. The author has communicated their lack of belief multiple times, yet the parents continue to enforce attendance. This could lead to the author feeling resentful and acting out as a form of protest. In that case, the parents might bear some responsibility for creating a situation where the author feels they must act inappropriately.\n\nBut the key issue here is whether the author's actions are wrong regardless of the circumstances. In public or shared spaces, there are social norms to follow. Using earbuds and listening to music is generally acceptable, but using a phone to text during a formal service might be seen as disrespectful, especially if it's distracting to others. The author's mom is upset, so from her perspective, the author isn't showing proper respect to the setting, even if they don't believe in it.\n\nHowever, the author is being forced to attend a place of worship they don't adhere to. There's a difference between attending a service where you don't believe and being forced to attend. In some cultures or families, attending religious services is a social or family obligation, and not participating fully might be frowned upon, even if you don't personally believe.\n\nAnother angle is the intent behind the author's actions. They aren't attending the service of their own free will but are being coerced. Their actions might be a form of rebellion against the pressure from their parents. But in that case, using earbuds and texting is a passive-aggressive way of showing disapproval, which isn't the healthiest approach.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author's actions could be seen as disrespectful because they're not participating in the service and are using their phone, which might disturb others. However, the underlying issue is the parents forcing attendance despite the author's beliefs. The author might not be in the wrong if we consider the context of being forced to attend a place they don't believe in, but the actions themselves might still be seen as inappropriate. The answer could depend on whether the focus is on the action itself or the circumstances leading to it.\n\nI think the majority might lean towards the author being in the wrong because they are in a public service where respect for the environment is expected, regardless of personal beliefs. Even if they don't believe, causing disruption through phone use could be seen as rude. However, there's also a case to be made that the parents are at fault for forcing attendance. But the question specifically asks if the author is in the wrong, so maybe the answer is A.\n"
