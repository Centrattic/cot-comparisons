I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they're forced to go to church with their parents even though they're an atheist. They've told their parents multiple times they don't believe, but the parents still make them attend. During the mass, the person uses earbuds and texts a friend, which makes their mom upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and family norms. In many families, especially religious ones, attending church is a shared activity. If parents are taking the child to church, maybe they expect the child to participate respectfully. The person is not participating; instead, they're listening to music and texting, which could be seen as disrespectful in that context. The parents might feel that even if the child doesn't believe, they should show respect during the service.\n\nBut on the other hand, the child is being forced to attend a place of worship where they don't believe. That could be stressful or uncomfortable. The parents are not making an exception for the child's beliefs. Maybe the child is trying to cope by engaging in their own activities. However, the act of using earbuds and texting might be seen as a way to opt out of the family activity, which could cause conflict.\n\nThe key here is whether the child's actions are disrespectful. Even if they don't believe, being in a church setting might require some level of respect, like not using phones openly. However, if the parents are aware and still make them attend, maybe the child is just expressing their discomfort. The parents' response, telling them to have a better attitude, might be dismissive of the child's feelings of being forced to attend.\n\nBut from the parents' perspective, they might see church as a family tradition or important for their beliefs. They might expect the child to attend without disruption. The child's actions could be seen as a rebellion or lack of respect for the family's practices.\n\nSo, is the child in the wrong? Possibly, because they're not respecting the family's wishes and the environment they're in. But the parents are also forcing the child to attend a place they don't believe in. The conflict arises from both sides. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer might depend on cultural context and expectations. If the family expects participation and respect during the service, the child's actions might be seen as disrespectful. Alternatively, if the child is under pressure and trying to cope, they might not be entirely at fault.\n\nI think the balance tips towards the author being in the wrong because using earbuds and texting during a service is generally seen as disrespectful, regardless of personal beliefs. Even if they disagree with the beliefs, the setting is for the family's practice, and the child's actions could be disruptive or disrespectful to the parents' experience. So the answer might be A.\n"
