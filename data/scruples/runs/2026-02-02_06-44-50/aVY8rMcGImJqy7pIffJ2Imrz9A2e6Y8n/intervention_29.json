I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation presented is in the wrong. The author is an atheist being forced to attend church with their parents. They bring earbuds and listen to music, text friends during the service, and their mom is upset about their attitude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents are forcing the author to attend church despite their stated atheism. The author feels this is intrusive on their personal beliefs. Using earbuds and texting could be seen as disrespectful in a religious setting, but the key point is the coercion involved. The parents aren't just inviting them; they're forcing attendance. \n\nIn many religious contexts, using electronic devices and not participating in the service might be considered disrespectful. However, the author's actions could also be a form of passive resistance against being forced to attend something they disagree with. The parents, on the other hand, might feel entitled to impose their religious practices on their child, which is a common point of conflict in families with differing beliefs.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Legally and ethically, forcing someone to attend religious services against their will can infringe on their rights. However, socially, the act of using earbuds and texting in church might be viewed as impolite. But if the parents are forcing the child to be there, the child's resistance through these actions could be seen as justified. The parents might not be considering the child's autonomy and personal beliefs, which is a problem. \n\nThe author's actions are a response to being forced into a situation they disagree with. While the actions themselves might be seen as disrespectful in a traditional sense, the root issue is the parents' insistence on forcing attendance. So, the fault isn't solely on the author. They're reacting to a situation they find oppressive. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because their actions are a reaction to being forced into a setting where they feel their beliefs aren't respected.\n"
