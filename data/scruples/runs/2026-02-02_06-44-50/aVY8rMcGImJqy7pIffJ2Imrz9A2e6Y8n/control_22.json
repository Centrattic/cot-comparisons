I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about attending a church mass against their will, being an atheist, and using earbuds and texting during the service.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is being forced by their parents to attend church, which they don't believe in. They've communicated their lack of belief multiple times. Now, they're using earbuds and texting as a way to cope with the uncomfortable situation. The parents are upset, giving dirty looks and criticizing the attitude.\n\nThe key points here are consent and respect. The author is not attending the church willingly; they're being forced. In that case, their actions could be seen as a form of protest against being compelled to participate in activities they disagree with. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. \n\nFrom a social perspective, attending a religious service typically expects certain behaviors, like quiet participation. Disruptive behavior could be seen as disrespectful. But in this case, the author is using earbuds and texting, which are personal actions that don't necessarily disrupt the service. The main issue is the forced attendance. If the parents are forcing them to attend, the author's actions might be a way to maintain their autonomy. \n\nOn the other hand, even if forced, the author might still have a responsibility to behave respectfully in a public setting. However, since they don't believe and are there against their will, the expectation of respect might be different. The parents' response of criticizing the attitude could also be problematic, as they're not respecting the child's beliefs and autonomy.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions are a response to being forced into a situation they disagree with. The primary fault might lie with the parents for not respecting their child's autonomy and beliefs. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
