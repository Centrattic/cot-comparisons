I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being forced to attend church with their parents as an atheist, using earbuds and texting during the service, and their mom being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is an atheist but is being forced to attend church by their parents. They've communicated their lack of belief before, but the parents still insist. The author is using earbuds and texting as a way to cope with the situation. \n\nNow, from a religious standpoint, attending church is a sacred activity, and using electronics during the service could be seen as disrespectful. The parents might feel that the author is being dismissive of their religious practices and their authority. On the other hand, the author is in a position of being coerced into participating in something they don't believe in, which can be stressful. Using earbuds and texting might be their way of dealing with that discomfort. \n\nHowever, even if the author is being forced, the act of visibly ignoring the service (through earbuds and texting) could be seen as being disrespectful, especially in a public setting like a church. The parents might feel that their religious environment is being disrespected, which could lead to conflict. \n\nThe author's actions might be a form of passive resistance against being forced to attend something they don't believe in. But from the parents' perspective, this resistance is happening in their sacred space, which they might find offensive. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they are in a public space where certain social norms are expected. Even if they are there against their will, they might be expected to maintain a level of respect for the environment. Using earbuds and texting could be seen as not adhering to those norms, hence being disrespectful. But the parents are also forcing the author to attend, which is a form of pressure. \n\nIt's a bit of a grey area. The author might be justified in feeling frustrated and using coping mechanisms, but their actions could be perceived as disrespectful. The parents, on the other hand, are enforcing their beliefs on their child, which might not be appropriate. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author might be in the wrong in terms of respecting the religious practices of their parents and the setting. However, the parents' insistence on forcing attendance without respecting the child's beliefs is also problematic. \n\nBut the question is specifically about the author's actions. The key point is whether using earbuds and texting is disrespectful in that context. If the author is in a space where others are participating respectfully, their actions could be seen as disruptive or disrespectful, regardless of their personal beliefs. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
