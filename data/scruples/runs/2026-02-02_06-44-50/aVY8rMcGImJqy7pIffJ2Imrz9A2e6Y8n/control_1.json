I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person described in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a teenager being forced to attend church by their parents despite being an atheist. The author admits to using earbuds and texting during mass, which led to their mom giving them dirty looks and criticism about having a negative attitude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The key points here are the forced attendance, the author's atheism, and their actions during the service. The parents are making them attend, which the author clearly doesn't want to do. The author's response is to disengage by listening to music and texting, which is a form of coping or rebellion.\n\nLegally and ethically, parents do have the right to make their children attend religious services if they're part of the family's tradition, but this varies by location and legal standards. However, from a moral standpoint, forcing a child to attend a service they don't believe in can be seen as infringing on their personal beliefs and autonomy. The author's actions might be a way to deal with the discomfort of being in an environment they find meaningless or even oppressive.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. The parents are forcing them to attend, which could be seen as the root issue. The author's response is understandable as a way to pass the time, but in a setting where active participation is expected, their disengagement might be perceived as disrespectful. However, the author is not participating in the religious activities against the parents' wishes but rather trying to manage their own time. The parents' criticism about attitude is misplaced if the underlying issue is the forced attendance.\n\nIt's also important to note that the author has communicated their lack of belief multiple times, which shows they're honest about their views. The parents' refusal to accept this and continue forcing attendance could be the main problem here. The author's actions, while potentially disrespectful to the parents' beliefs, are a reaction to being forced into a situation they disagree with.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a conflict between parental authority and personal autonomy. The parents might see the author's actions as disrespectful, but the author sees the attendance itself as forced. Without more context on cultural norms or specific laws, it's hard to say definitively, but from a personal ethics perspective, the author's actions are a form of self-preservation in an uncomfortable situation. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong if we consider the parents' actions as the primary issue.\n"
