I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves them being forced to attend church by their parents despite being an atheist. They used earbuds and checked their phone during the service, which led their mom to give them dirty looks and later criticize their attitude.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the parents forcing attendance at church, the individual's atheism, and their actions during the service. The person argues they don't believe and are being compelled to attend. Their actions (listening to music, texting) are a way to cope with the situation they find unpleasant. \n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. From a religious perspective, attending church and participating respectfully might be expected. However, the parents are the ones forcing the attendance against the child's beliefs. The child is expressing their discomfort by disengaging from the service. \n\nIt's important to consider both the parents' and the child's rights. The parents might feel it's their right to raise their children in their religion, but the child has autonomy and freedom of belief. The child's actions could be seen as disrespectful in a religious context, but they are also a form of resistance against being forced into an activity they disagree with. \n\nLegally and ethically, forcing someone to attend religious services against their will can be problematic. The child's actions might be a way to maintain their autonomy. However, in the context of the parents' expectations, the child's behavior could be viewed as disrespectful or defiant. \n\nSo, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the perspective. If we consider the parents' religious practices and expectations, the child might be seen as disrespectful. But if we look at the child's autonomy and the forced participation, the child's actions could be justified as a form of coping. The answer might lean towards \"not in the wrong\" because the root issue is the parents forcing attendance.\n"
