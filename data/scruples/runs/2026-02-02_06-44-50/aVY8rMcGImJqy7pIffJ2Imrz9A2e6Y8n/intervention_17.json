I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for wearing earbuds and texting during a church mass they don't believe in, which their parents are forcing them to attend. The options are A (yes, they're in the wrong) or B (no, they're not). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is an atheist, and their parents have recently become more religious, forcing them to attend church. The author has expressed their lack of belief multiple times but continues to be forced to go. During one mass, they use earbuds and texts a friend while listening to music. Their mom is upset, giving dirty looks and criticizing their attitude.\n\nNow, the key points here are the forced participation and the author's actions. From a moral standpoint, attending a religious service in good faith usually requires respect towards the rituals and the environment. However, the author isn't attending by choice; they're being forced. Their actions (listening to music, texting) might be seen as disrespectful from the parents' perspective, especially in a setting that values attentiveness and participation.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, maybe it depends on the perspective. If the author is being coerced into attending, then their actions could be a form of protest against being forced into a practice they don't believe in. However, in many religious contexts, showing up but not participating is still seen as disrespectful, regardless of personal beliefs. The parents might expect their child to at least be respectful during the service, even if they don't share the beliefs.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has already communicated their disbelief multiple times, so perhaps there's an expectation from the parents that they should still attend politely. The author's actions might be seen as a way to cope with an uncomfortable situation, but that doesn't necessarily make them right in the eyes of the parents or the religious community.\n\nAlso, considering that the parents are forcing the author to attend, that could be the fault of the parents for not respecting their child's beliefs. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The parents' actions might be the root issue, but the author's behavior during the service is the focus here.\n\nSo, in terms of the author's actions, using earbuds and texting could be considered disrespectful in the context of a church service, regardless of their personal beliefs. Even if they don't believe, showing up and engaging in other activities might not be appropriate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for their behavior, even if the parents are forcing them to attend. \n\nBut there's another angle: if the parents are forcing attendance, the author's actions could be a form of resistance against that pressure. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about justification. From the parents' perspective, the author is being disrespectful. From the author's perspective, they're in a situation they don't agree with. It's a bit of a conflict between personal autonomy and respect for others' customs. \n\nIn many social situations, attending a service that you don't believe in but still showing respect (like sitting quietly, not using electronic devices) is considered the norm. So, the author's choice to use earbuds and text might be seen as violating that norm, making them the one in the wrong. However, if the parents are the ones forcing them into a situation they find meaningless, that's also problematic. But the question is specifically about the author's actions during the service.\n\nConsidering all that, the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because their behavior during the service was disrespectful regardless of their circumstances. Even if forced to attend, the expectation in such settings is to be present and respectful, not to engage in other activities that show disinterest or disrespect.\n"
