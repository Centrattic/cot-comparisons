I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about someone being forced to attend church by their parents even though they're an atheist. They're using earbuds and texting friends during the mass, which their mom is upset about.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's parents are making them attend church despite their beliefs. The author is expressing their discomfort by listening to music and texting. The parents might see this as disrespectful, especially in a religious setting. But the author is being forced to participate in something they don't believe in, which could be a problem.\n\nFrom a respect standpoint, even if you don't believe in the religion, showing respect by not using earbuds or phone might be expected. But the author is being forced to attend, which is a form of pressure. The parents' approach might be the real issue here\u2014they're not respecting the author's beliefs and autonomy. However, the author's actions during the service could be seen as disrespectful in the context of a religious event.\n\nIt's a bit of a conflict between personal autonomy and respecting cultural/religious practices. The author might feel they have a right to their own beliefs, but the parents are using coercion. The author's actions during the service might be a form of protest, but they could also be seen as impolite. However, if the parents are forcing attendance without respecting the child's beliefs, that's a problem. The author's response might be a way to cope with the situation they're uncomfortable in.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, maybe the parents are at fault for forcing attendance, but the author's actions are a reaction to that. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the parents are in the wrong for forcing them, then the author's actions might be justified as a form of resistance. But in a public setting like church, there's an expectation of participation or at least respectful behavior. The author's actions could disrupt others or be seen as disrespectful, even if they're an atheist.\n\nSo, on one hand, the author is being forced into an environment they don't agree with, which is problematic. On the other, using earbuds and texting during a service might not be respectful. The parents' approach is questionable, but the author's actions could also be seen as lacking consideration for the setting. It's a bit of a toss-up. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the parents are the ones forcing them to be there, maybe the author's actions are a reasonable way to cope, but in the context of the church, it's still disrespectful. Alternatively, if the parents are wrong for forcing attendance, the author's actions are a justified protest. It's a tricky balance. I think the author is partially in the wrong for the actions taken during the service, but the parents are also at fault for the coercion. However, the question is specifically about the author's wrongdoing. Since the author chose to use earbuds and text, which could be seen as disrespectful regardless of their beliefs, maybe they are in the wrong. But if the parents are forcing them to be there, they might be excused. I'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because of the context of the church, but the situation is complex.\n"
