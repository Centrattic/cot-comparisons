I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about attending a church mass they don't believe in, being forced by parents, and then using earbuds and texting during the service.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is an atheist, which means they don't believe in the religious practices of the church. Their parents have recently started going to church and are forcing them to attend. The writer feels it's against their beliefs and is trying to cope by listening to music and texting. \n\nNow, the parents are upset, giving dirty looks and criticizing the child's attitude. The question is whether the writer is in the wrong. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if attending church is against the person's beliefs, then using earbuds to listen to music could be seen as a way to cope with an uncomfortable situation. However, in a public religious service, the expectations might be to be respectful and attentive, regardless of one's beliefs. The parents might view the earbuds and texting as disrespectful, especially in a setting where they consider participation important. \n\nBut on the other hand, the person is being forced to attend something they don't believe in, which can be stressful. The parents are forcing the child to attend, which might be considered authoritarian. The child is expressing their discomfort through their actions, which could be seen as a form of resistance. \n\nHowever, the act of using earbuds and texting during a mass might be seen as disrespectful in the context of the church, even if the person doesn't believe. So, there's a conflict between the child's right to personal comfort and the parents' expectations of respect in a religious setting. \n\nBut the parents are also forcing the child to attend, which isn't ideal. The child's actions could be a form of protest. However, from an external perspective, the child could be seen as not respecting their parents' wishes and the setting of the church. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on cultural norms. In some cultures, attending church is a family tradition, and not participating in the rituals is seen as disrespectful. In others, personal choice and comfort might be prioritized. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If we take the parents' side, the author is being disrespectful. If we take the author's side, they're being forced into a situation they don't want. \n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're in a situation where they're forced to attend something they don't believe in, and using earbuds is a way to cope. However, there's an argument that they could have found another way without being disruptive. But given the parents' forcing them, the author's actions are a reaction to that coercion.\n"
