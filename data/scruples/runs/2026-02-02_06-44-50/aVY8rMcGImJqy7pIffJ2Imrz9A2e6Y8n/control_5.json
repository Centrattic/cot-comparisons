I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for wearing earbuds and checking their phone during a church mass they were forced to attend, even though they're an atheist. The parents are making them go to church every Sunday, and the kid is trying to cope by listening to music and texting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is an atheist, which means they don't believe in the religion their parents are practicing. They've communicated their lack of belief multiple times, but the parents still force them to attend. That's a key point. The parents are not respecting the child's autonomy and beliefs. The child is in a position of being forced to participate in an activity they find meaningless or even offensive.\n\nNow, the actions in question: using earbuds and texting. In a church setting, especially during a mass, there's an expectation of quiet reflection and participation. Wearing earbuds might be seen as disrespectful because it could be distracting to others or considered a lack of engagement with the service. Texting during mass could also be viewed as disrespectful, similar to how one might judge someone using their phone in a quiet or formal setting.\n\nBut the other side is that the child is being forced to attend against their will. From their perspective, they're being made to attend something they don't believe in, so their actions might be a way to cope with the situation. The parents are creating a scenario where the child is either forced to sit through something they disagree with or find ways to disengage, which they do through music and texting.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the parents' reaction. The mom is giving dirty looks and criticizing the child's attitude. The child has already communicated their lack of belief, so the parents' insistence on forcing them to attend might be the root issue here. The child's actions could be a form of passive resistance or a way to manage their discomfort.\n\nHowever, from a social standpoint, even in a forced situation, the behavior during the mass might still be considered disrespectful by the parents or others present. The question is whether the child's actions are justified given the circumstances. If the parents are the ones forcing attendance, perhaps the fault lies more with them for not respecting the child's autonomy. The child's actions are a response to being forced into an environment they find alienating.\n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. In many cultures, there's an expectation to be respectful in a place of worship, regardless of personal beliefs. Even if forced to attend, the standard social behavior would be to be quiet and not use electronic devices. The child's actions could be seen as disrespectful, but considering the context of being forced to attend by their parents, there's a counterargument that the parents are the ones at fault for creating the situation.\n\nSo the answer might depend on perspective. If we look strictly at the behavior during the mass, the child is breaking social norms. But if we consider the context of forced attendance and the child's right to autonomy, the fault might lie with the parents. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the parents are forcing the child, but the child's actions are still against the norms of the setting, there's a nuance here.\n\nIn many \"Am I the Asshole\" scenarios, the answer often hinges on respecting others' wishes and social norms. The parents want to attend church, and they want their child to attend with them, possibly to model behavior or for family cohesion. The child is resisting in a way that disrupts the service and is disrespectful in the parents' eyes. However, the parents are not respecting the child's beliefs by forcing attendance. It's a conflict between two sets of values.\n\nIn conclusion, considering both the social expectations of respecting the setting and the parents' failure to respect the child's autonomy, there's a balance. But the immediate question is about the author's actions. If we take the stance that even in a forced situation, the behavior (using earbuds and texting) is disrespectful, then the author is in the wrong. However, if we consider the parents' role in forcing attendance, the fault is more on them. But the question is specifically about the author's actions in the situation, not the parents' actions. So the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because their actions during the mass are disrespectful, regardless of the parents' role in creating the situation.\n"
