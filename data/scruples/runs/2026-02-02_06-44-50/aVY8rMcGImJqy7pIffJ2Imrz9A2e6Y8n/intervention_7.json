I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through their situation again.\n\nThey're an atheist forced to attend church with their parents every Sunday. They brought earbuds and listened to music, texted a friend during mass. Their mom gave them dirty looks and later criticized their attitude, saying they should enjoy things more. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about respect, personal beliefs, and family dynamics. The author is an atheist, so they don't believe in the religion, which their parents have recently embraced. They've communicated their lack of belief multiple times but are still forced to attend. That's a problem because forcing someone to participate in religious activities they don't believe in can be seen as infringing on their autonomy.\n\nNow, during mass, they used earbuds and texted friends. In a religious setting, especially one that's formal like a church mass, such actions might be considered disrespectful by others present. Even if the person is an atheist, disrupting the service or not participating in the rituals might be frowned upon by the community or family members. However, the parents are the ones forcing them to attend in the first place, which complicates things.\n\nThe parents might feel that attending church is a family tradition or a moral obligation, hence the insistence. The author, on the other hand, is trying to cope with being forced into a situation they find meaningless or even unpleasant. Their actions could be seen as a form of protest or coping mechanism. But from the parents' perspective, especially in a religious context, not participating actively (like listening to music and texting) might be viewed as disrespectful or defiant.\n\nThe author's mom criticizes their attitude, but the author has already stated their disbelief multiple times. The parents might not be acknowledging the author's autonomy and are instead pressuring them to conform. That could be a bigger issue here. However, the author's actions during the mass could be seen as disrespectful in the context of the church, regardless of their personal beliefs.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, they were forced into a situation they don't believe in and are trying to cope. On the other hand, their actions during the service might be seen as disrespectful to the religious practice and their parents' wishes. It's a conflict between personal autonomy and respect for family and tradition.\n\nI think this is a nuanced situation. The parents are at fault for forcing their child to attend church against their beliefs, which is a form of coercion. However, the author's actions during the mass might be seen as disrespectful in that setting, even if they are an atheist. So, there's a bit of blame on both sides. But the initial question is whether the author is in the wrong. If we focus on their actions during the mass, perhaps they are in the wrong for being disrespectful, but if we look at the parents' actions, they are the ones forcing the attendance. The answer depends on the perspective. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, considering the scenario as presented. Since the author is in a place where they don't belong (from their perspective) and are trying to cope, maybe their actions are understandable. But in the context of the church, their actions could be seen as rude. I'm a bit torn here. Maybe the answer is that they are not in the wrong because the parents are forcing them into a situation they don't want to be in. Alternatively, the author's actions are disrespectful regardless. Hmm.\n"
