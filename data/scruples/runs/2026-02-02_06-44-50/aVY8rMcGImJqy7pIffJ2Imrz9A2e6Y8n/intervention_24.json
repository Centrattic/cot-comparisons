I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the person is an atheist but is forced to go to church by their parents. They brought earbuds and listened to music, and also texted a friend during the mass. Their mom was upset and told them they have a negative attitude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of both sides. The author's parents want them to attend church with them, even though the author doesn't believe. The author feels it's forced and is trying to cope by listening to music and texting. But during a religious service, using earbuds and texting might be seen as disrespectful, especially in a church setting where people are expected to be attentive or participate in some way. The mom's reaction is based on the belief that the author is showing a bad attitude, even though the author doesn't share the religion.\n\nNow, laws of the land: In many countries, including the US, freedom of religion includes the right to not practice a religion. However, public behavior in places of worship might have expectations of respect. The author is in a public space where others are there for the service. Using earbuds and texting could be seen as disruptive or disrespectful to others attending the service, even if it's not illegal. \n\nFrom the author's side, they're being forced to attend, which is a form of pressure from parents. But even if you're forced to attend, once you're there, the expectation is to behave respectfully. The author might feel they're not part of the religion, so they don't need to participate. But in such a setting, there's a social norm of decorum. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author's actions cross the line into disrespect, regardless of their personal beliefs. The mom's reaction is about the behavior during the service, not the beliefs. Even if the author is an atheist, their actions during the service can affect others. The author might be in the wrong for not respecting the setting they're in, even if they're being forced to attend. But maybe the parents are also in the wrong for forcing their child to attend against their will. However, the question is specifically about the author's actions during the mass.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's behavior was disrespectful in the context of a church service. Since using earbuds and texting are seen as disrespectful in that setting, the author might be in the wrong. But the parents forcing attendance is also an issue. However, the question is about the author's actions during the mass. So, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their behavior was disrespectful in the church context, regardless of their personal beliefs or being forced to attend.\n"
