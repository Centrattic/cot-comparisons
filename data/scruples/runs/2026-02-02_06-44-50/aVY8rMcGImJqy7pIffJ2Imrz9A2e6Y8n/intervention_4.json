I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author is an atheist forced to attend church with their parents, so they wear earbuds and check their phone during the service. The parents are upset, and the author is wondering if they're being a bitch or if the parents are at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The author is an atheist, so they don't believe in the religion their parents are practicing. They've communicated their lack of belief multiple times but are still forced to attend. During mass, they use earbuds and text a friend. The parents are upset, giving dirty looks and later criticizing the author's attitude.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms. In many traditional settings, especially religious ones, there's an expectation of respect during services. Even if someone doesn't believe, being visibly disengaged (like using earbuds or on a phone) might be seen as disrespectful by others in the congregation or the family. The parents might feel that the author isn't respecting their choice to attend church, even if they don't share the beliefs.\n\nHowever, the parents are forcing the author to attend, which is a key point. If someone is forced to go to a place they disagree with, their behavior might be a form of resistance. The author is an adult here, but even if a minor, being forced to attend a religious service they don't believe in could be a source of conflict. The parents might have a right to expect some level of respect during the service, even if the author's participation is coerced.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the parents are forcing attendance, the author might have a valid reason to seek some form of personal coping mechanism, like listening to music. However, using earbuds and texting are actions that are clearly disruptive or disrespectful in the eyes of the parents and possibly the church community. The parents' reaction is about the attitude, not necessarily the beliefs, so the author's actions are seen as disrespectful regardless of their personal views.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's actions could be a form of protest against being forced into a practice they don't agree with. But in terms of social norms, especially in a family context, respecting the family's wishes during shared activities (even if you don't agree) is often expected. The author might be in the wrong because they chose to show their disengagement in a way that upsets the parents, rather than finding a more respectful way to cope, like sitting quietly.\n\nBut wait, the author is an adult. If they are old enough to make their own decisions, the parents shouldn't be forcing them to attend. However, if they're a minor, the parents have some authority. The post doesn't specify the age, but the tone suggests they might be a teenager or young adult. In that case, the conflict is between parental authority and the child's autonomy. The parents might be at fault for forcing attendance, but the author's response is also problematic because of the disrespectful behavior.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they chose actions that are disrespectful to the parents and the setting, even if they're being forced to attend. The parents might have their own faults, but the question is about the author's actions. The answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
