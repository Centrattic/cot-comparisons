I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being forced to attend church by their parents despite being an atheist. During the church service, the author wears earbuds and texts a friend. The mom gets upset and criticizes the author's attitude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is an atheist but is being made to attend church with their parents. They've communicated their lack of belief before but the parents still make them go. The author uses earbuds and texts, which the mom disapproves of. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom a religious standpoint, attending church with earbuds and texting might be seen as disrespectful, especially if the church expects attentive participation. However, the author is not a believer and is being forced to attend. The parents might expect the child to respect the tradition and participate, even if they don't believe. On the other hand, the author's actions could be a way to cope with discomfort in a situation they're not okay with.\n\nAnother angle is the parents' approach. If they're forcing the child to attend church despite knowing the child's beliefs, that might be the issue. The child's reaction could be a form of resistance. However, the author's choice to use earbuds and text might still be seen as disrespectful in that context, regardless of their personal beliefs.\n\nThe mom's criticism about a negative attitude is ironic given that the author is being forced to attend and is expressing their discomfort. The parents might not be considering their child's feelings here. But the author's actions could be seen as rebellious rather than respectful.\n\nIn terms of social norms, in many religious settings, having earbuds in and using a phone is considered inconsiderate. Even if the author is an atheist, the act of attending the service (even reluctantly) might require some level of respect for the setting. However, if the parents are imposing their beliefs and forcing attendance, the child's actions might be a reaction to that pressure.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the context of the church service, but the parents are also at fault for forcing attendance against the child's beliefs. The question is whether the author's actions are the main issue here. The answer hinges on cultural expectations and the importance placed on respecting the religious setting versus the right to personal autonomy and belief expression.\n"
