I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they're an atheist, forced to go to church with their parents, and they're using earbuds and texting during mass. Their mom is upset and says they have a negative attitude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and family norms. Church is usually a place where people are expected to be respectful, even if you don't believe. So maybe using earbuds and texting is seen as disrespectful. But the person is being forced to attend against their beliefs, which complicates things. They've told their parents they don't believe, but the parents keep forcing them.\n\nOn one hand, the parents might expect their child to be respectful in a place of worship, even if they don't share the beliefs. On the other hand, forcing someone to attend can be problematic, especially if they're not allowed to express their discomfort in a way that's acceptable to them.\n\nThe person's actions (earbuds, texting) might be a way to deal with being in a situation they find oppressive. But from the parents' perspective, that behavior could be seen as disrespectful or ungrateful. The mom's comment about having a negative attitude suggests she's frustrated, which might be because she sees the child's behavior as disrespectful.\n\nBut the root issue is the forced attendance. If the parents were more understanding and allowed the child to opt out without pressure, maybe the situation would be different. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Respect in public spaces is important, but the author's actions are a form of protest against being forced to attend. It's a bit of a gray area. Depending on cultural context, some might see the author as justified, others as disrespectful. Since the author is in a place they disagree with and trying to cope, but their coping method might be seen as rude. So maybe they're in the wrong? Or maybe the parents are at fault for forcing attendance. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Answer depends on balancing respect and personal beliefs vs. forced participation.\n"
