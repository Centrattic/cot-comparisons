I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person is an atheist but is being forced by their parents to attend church every Sunday. They're wearing earbuds and texting during the mass, which upsets their mom. The mom then criticizes their attitude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is being forced to attend a religious service they don't believe in. From a personal freedom standpoint, that's a problem. But the author chose to respond by using earbuds and texting. In a public setting like a church, even if you don't believe, there might be social expectations. Using earbuds could be seen as disrespectful, especially in a place where silence or participation is expected. Texting might also be viewed as rude or distracting. However, the parents are the ones forcing them to attend, which isn't ideal either.\n\nIs the author being a \"bitch\" as they put it? Well, if they're in a space where others are expecting certain behavior, even if they don't agree with the purpose, their actions could be seen as disrespectful to others present. On the other hand, the parents are forcing them to attend against their beliefs, which isn't right either. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong here, not the parents' actions. \n\nThe author's actions might be a form of passive resistance, but in a public setting, that can affect others. The mom's criticism is about attitude, but maybe the author's behavior is justified because they're being forced to attend. However, even if they're being forced, the way they respond can have consequences. So it's a bit of a gray area. But in terms of social norms and respecting the environment they're in, the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate, even if they have their reasons.\n"
