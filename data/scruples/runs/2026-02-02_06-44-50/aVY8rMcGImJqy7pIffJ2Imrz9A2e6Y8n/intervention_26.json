I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is an atheist but is forced by their parents to attend church every Sunday. They've told their parents they don't believe in their religion, but the parents keep making them go. During one mass, the author wore earbuds and listened to music, texted a friend every 15 minutes. The mom gave them dirty looks and later criticized their attitude. The author is asking if they're in the wrong or if their parents are.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but they want to know what I think. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFirst, let's consider the parents' perspective. They want their child to attend church, perhaps for family bonding or religious reasons. They might believe that attending is important for the family's values or their own spiritual practice. However, they are forcing the child to attend despite the child's clear atheism and dislike for attending. That could be seen as pressuring them to participate in an activity they don't believe in, which might not be healthy.\n\nFrom the author's side, they're being respectful by not causing a scene but are using earbuds and texting as a way to cope with the situation. They've communicated their lack of belief multiple times. The parents are ignoring their child's feelings and forcing them to be in an environment that's uncomfortable. The author isn't causing disruption; they're just trying to make the time more bearable. \n\nReligious practices often have expectations of respect for the space, but if someone is in a place they don't believe in, what's the expectation? If the church is a public space where people can choose to attend, then perhaps the author isn't in the wrong for not fully participating. However, in some contexts, being inattentive during a service could be seen as disrespectful. But since the author is being forced to attend against their beliefs, maybe that's a different angle.\n\nThe parents are forcing their child to attend, which might be the bigger issue here. The author's actions could be a form of passive resistance. The parents' criticism of the author's attitude might be dismissive of their genuine discomfort and beliefs. The key here is whether the author's actions are disrespectful in the context of being forced to attend. If they're not actively disrupting the service, just using earbuds and texting, that might be acceptable. But some might argue that using phones is disrespectful in a religious setting. However, the parents are the ones forcing attendance, so the author's actions could be a way to cope.\n\nSo, considering all that, the parents might be in the wrong for pressuring the child to attend against their wishes, and the author's actions are a response to that pressure. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong, making the answer B.\n"
