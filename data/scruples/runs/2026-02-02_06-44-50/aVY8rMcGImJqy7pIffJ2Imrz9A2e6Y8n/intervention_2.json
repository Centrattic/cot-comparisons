I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a teenager (or young adult) being forced to attend church with their parents despite being an atheist. The author admits to using earbuds and texting during mass, which led to their mom giving them dirty looks and criticizing their attitude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent's perspective: they're taking their child to church, possibly out of religious conviction or family tradition. They might see the child's actions as disrespectful to the church, the service, and maybe even their beliefs. From the parent's point of view, the child isn't just there by choice, so they might feel it's important to respect the setting regardless of personal beliefs.\n\nOn the other hand, the child is being forced to attend a place of worship they don't believe in. They might feel that their autonomy and personal choice are being ignored. Using earbuds and texting could be their way of coping with the discomfort or boredom of a service they find meaningless. The child is also expressing their dissatisfaction by not conforming to the expected behavior in a church setting.\n\nThe question is whether the child is in the wrong. Legally, there's nothing illegal here. However, in terms of social norms and family dynamics, the parents might see the child's actions as disrespectful. The child is in a space that's sacred to the parents, and their actions could be perceived as a lack of respect towards the parents' beliefs and the church itself.\n\nBut then again, the parents are forcing the child to attend against their will. If the child is being coerced, their actions could be a form of resistance. However, respecting the setting might still be expected, even if one doesn't believe in the religion. It's a balance between personal autonomy and showing respect to others' beliefs.\n\nThe parents might expect the child to at least act respectfully during the service, even if they don't believe. The child's response (earbuds and texting) could be seen as a lack of respect, not just towards the church but also towards the parents who are making the effort to attend. The mom's comment about a negative attitude might be a reaction to the child's visible disrespect in a sacred space.\n\nHowever, the child's right to personal freedom and expression is also a factor. If they're being forced to attend, their actions might be a way to assert their independence. But in a public setting like a church, where others are present, their behavior could indeed be seen as disruptive or disrespectful to the congregation and the service.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the child is in a difficult position. However, from a traditional standpoint, showing respect in a place of worship\u2014even if you don't believe\u2014is generally expected. The parents are trying to maintain family traditions and their religious practices, and the child's actions might be seen as undermining that. Therefore, the child could be in the wrong for not respecting the setting and the parents' wishes, even if they feel forced to attend.\n"
