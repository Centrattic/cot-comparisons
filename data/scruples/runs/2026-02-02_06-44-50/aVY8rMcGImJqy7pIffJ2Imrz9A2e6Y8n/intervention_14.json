I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is an atheist forced to go to church by their parents. During the mass, they wear earbuds and check their phone, which leads to their mom giving them dirty looks and criticizing their attitude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and familial context. The parents are newly interested in church, so maybe they see attending mass as important for family unity or personal faith. The author, however, doesn't believe and is being dragged along against their will. That's a key point. The parents might see it as a family obligation, while the author feels it's a violation of their autonomy.\n\nNow, the author's actions: listening to music and texting. In a church setting, especially one that's traditional, such behavior is typically seen as disrespectful. Even if the author is an atheist, the social norms in many religious contexts expect a certain level of decorum. Wearing earbuds could be considered dismissive or disrespectful to the service, and texting might be seen as being distracted or not engaged. \n\nBut there's another angle. The author is being forced to participate in an activity they don't believe in. That's a form of pressure, which could be problematic. The parents might not realize how intrusive this is, especially if the author has repeatedly stated their lack of belief. The parents might be enforcing their values without considering the child's autonomy, which could lead to conflict.\n\nSo, who's at fault? The author is choosing to engage in behaviors that are socially frowned upon in the church setting. Even if they're upset about being forced to attend, reacting by being disruptive might not be the best approach. However, the parents are also at fault for not respecting the author's beliefs and autonomy. But the question is specifically about the author's actions. \n\nThe author's justification is that they're being forced to attend, so they're trying to cope by doing something they enjoy. But in a public space like a church, there's an expectation to follow the norms of that space, regardless of personal beliefs. So, even as an atheist, one might be expected to maintain a respectful demeanor. The parents might argue that even if the author doesn't believe, they should respect the setting when they're there. \n\nOn the other hand, if the parents are being overly controlling and not respecting the author's autonomy, the author's resentment is understandable. But the immediate actions (earbuds and texting) are what's in question. The author might be seen as inconsiderate of the parents' feelings and the church's atmosphere. \n\nSo, balancing both sides: the parents are wrong to force attendance, but the author is also in the wrong for acting disrespectfully during the service. However, the question is specifically about the author's wrongdoing. Since the author is choosing to engage in behaviors that disrupt the service (even if it's for personal comfort), that's where the fault lies. The parents' actions are separate but also problematic. \n\nThe answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because their actions are disrespectful in the context of the church service, regardless of their reasons. The parents' enforcement of attendance is an issue, but the focus here is on the author's behavior during the service.\n"
