I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wearing earbuds and texting during a church service they were forced to attend. The author is an atheist and their parents are making them go to church every Sunday. They've tried explaining their disbelief, but the parents ignore it. The author brought earbuds to listen to music and text a friend to pass the time. The mom got upset, called them a negative attitude.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the main points here. The parents are forcing the child to attend church despite their beliefs. The child is trying to cope by using earbuds and texting. The parents are upset because of this. So, is the child in the wrong?\n\nWell, the child is being forced to attend a religious service they don't believe in. That's a key point. Forced participation in a religion isn't good, especially for an adult. The child's actions might be seen as disrespectful from the parents' perspective, but if they're being forced to attend, maybe their reaction is justified. The parents' response is also important. If they're ignoring the child's beliefs, that's part of the problem.\n\nIn terms of social norms, in a church setting, people generally expect others to be respectful of the service, even if they don't share the beliefs. So the child's actions might be seen as disruptive. But the context is that they're being forced to attend, so their coping mechanism could be understandable. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If we look at it from the parents' side, they might feel that the child is being disrespectful. But from the child's side, they're being forced to attend something they don't believe in and are trying to get through it their way. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both sides might have some fault. The parents for forcing attendance, and the child for the actions during the service. But the user is asking specifically if the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn many cases, when someone is in a public space and is being respectful, they can do what they want unless it's disruptive. The earbuds are for personal use and don't interfere with others, so that might be okay. Texting could be seen as more disruptive, but if it's not causing a disturbance, maybe not. \n\nHowever, the parents might see it as disrespectful to the service. But if the child isn't a member of the religion, maybe they don't owe the service respect. \n\nSo considering all that, the author's actions might be a way to cope with being forced into an unwanted situation. The parents are at fault for forcing attendance. The author isn't in the wrong because they're reacting to their parents' forced participation. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
