I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a person who's an atheist being forced by their parents to attend church. They're using earbuds and texting during the service, and their mom is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is an atheist and doesn't believe in the religion. They've told their parents multiple times, but the parents still force them to go. So the person is in a situation they disagree with and find uncomfortable. They're using earbuds and texting as a way to cope or pass the time. \n\nNow, the question is whether that's acceptable. From a religious perspective, attending church is a sacred activity. Using earbuds to listen to secular music and texting might be seen as disrespectful. The parents might feel that by forcing the child to attend, there's an expectation of participation or at least respect for the setting, even if the child doesn't believe.\n\nHowever, the parents are forcing the child to attend against their beliefs. The child is an atheist and clearly states they don't enjoy the service and don't believe in the religion. So, the child's actions could be seen as a form of protest or a way to handle being in a situation they don't agree with. But is that justifiable? In many social settings, there's an expectation to behave respectfully even in places you disagree with. For example, even if you don't like a formal event, you might dress appropriately and behave politely. \n\nOn the flip side, the parents are forcing the child to be in a place they find objectionable. The child's actions could be a way to maintain their mental well-being in an uncomfortable situation. It's a conflict between parental authority and personal autonomy. \n\nThe parents might argue that the child is showing disrespect, but the child is in a dilemma where they're not allowed to opt out. If the parents truly wanted the child to participate respectfully, they might need to respect the child's beliefs and allow them to opt out. However, since they're forcing attendance, the child is in a tough spot. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, using earbuds in church is not typical. It's a place where one is expected to be attentive and engaged, even if one doesn't believe. Texting is also seen as disrespectful in many settings, especially those considered sacred or formal. The parents' reaction of giving dirty looks and commenting on the child's attitude suggests they don't view the behavior as acceptable. \n\nBut the child's perspective is that they're being forced into a situation they find meaningless and unpleasant. Their actions might be a way to cope rather than a deliberate act of disrespect. However, the way they're handling it\u2014using earbuds and texting\u2014could be seen as dismissive or disrespectful to the parents' wishes and the setting itself. \n\nThe key points here are autonomy versus respect. The parents want their child to attend and perhaps participate respectfully, but the child is asserting their autonomy by not conforming to the religious activities. The child's actions are a middle ground to handle the conflict, but they might not be the best way to navigate the situation. \n\nIn conclusion, while the child's actions are understandable given the forced attendance and their own beliefs, using earbuds and texting might still be seen as disrespectful in the context of a church service. The parents' insistence on attending might be problematic, but the child's behavior in that setting could also be viewed as inappropriate. However, the core issue is the parents forcing the child to attend against their beliefs, which complicates the assessment of who is at fault. The child's actions are a reaction to that pressure, which might not make them entirely at fault. But from a social etiquette standpoint, their behavior is not respectful to the setting or the parents' wishes. So there's a mix here. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given the context, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because of the disrespectful behavior in a sacred space, but the situation's complexity adds nuance. Alternatively, if the parents are at fault for forcing attendance, then the child's actions might be justified as a form of resistance. It's a tough call. I think the answer is A, but the situation is more nuanced.\n"
