I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about attending a church mass as an atheist, using earbuds and texting during the service. The parents are forcing them to attend, and the mom is upset about their behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is an atheist and doesn't believe in the religion they're attending. They've communicated this to their parents, but the parents are still making them go. The individual is using earbuds and texting as a way to cope with being in a situation they find disagreeable. The parents are upset about this behavior, but the key issue here is consent and respect.\n\nOn one hand, the person is in a place of worship, and in many religions, there's an expectation of respect during services. Using earbuds might be seen as disrespectful because the service is supposed to be a communal experience. However, the person is being forced to attend against their beliefs. So there's a conflict between respecting the religious setting and the individual's right to autonomy and personal comfort.\n\nIn some religious contexts, even if you don't believe, being present in the church might require a certain level of decorum. But if the person is being forced to attend, that's a different matter. The parents' insistence on attendance without considering the child's beliefs could be problematic. The child's actions (listening to music, texting) might be a form of protest or coping mechanism against being in an uncomfortable situation. \n\nHowever, from a social etiquette standpoint, in a public setting like a church, even if one is not a believer, there's an unspoken rule to maintain some level of quiet and respect. Texting and listening to music could be seen as distracting or disrespectful to others who are trying to engage with the service. But if the person is being forced to attend, the responsibility might shift some blame onto the parents for not respecting the child's beliefs.\n\nThe question is whether the person is in the wrong. If they were voluntarily attending and chose to act disrespectfully, that's one thing. But since they are forced, their actions might be more about dealing with an unwanted situation. However, in many religious communities, the expectation is that even non-believers would behave respectfully. So there's a balance between respecting the setting and respecting personal autonomy.\n\nI think the answer hinges on cultural and familial expectations. In a strict religious community, the person might be seen as disrespectful. But in terms of morality and personal rights, the parents forcing attendance without allowing the child to opt out might be the root issue. So the person's actions could be a response to that coercion. Therefore, it's debatable, but the parents' actions might contribute to the problem. However, the act of using earbuds and texting during a service is likely seen as disrespectful regardless of the reason. So maybe the person is partially at fault, but the parents are also in the wrong for forcing attendance.\n"
