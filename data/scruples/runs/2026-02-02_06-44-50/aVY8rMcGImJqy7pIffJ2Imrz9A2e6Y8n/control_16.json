I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for wearing earbuds and checking their phone during a church mass they're forced to attend. The person is an atheist but is being made to go to church by their parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and religious norms. In many religious settings, including church services, there's an expectation of respect and attentiveness. Using earbuds and phones might be seen as disrespectful because it shows you're not fully present or engaged. But the person is there against their will, so maybe that's a mitigating factor.\n\nThe parents are forcing them to attend, even after the person has expressed their atheist views. The parents might feel that attending church is important for family unity or moral reasons. However, forcing someone to participate in a religion they don't believe in can be problematic. The person might feel this is a violation of their autonomy and beliefs.\n\nThe person's actions could be seen as a form of protest or coping mechanism. They're trying to make the time bearable. On the other hand, from the parents' perspective, the behavior might look dismissive and disrespectful, hence the dirty looks and criticism.\n\nI need to balance the respect for the parents' wishes and the child's right to express their beliefs. If the person is being forced to attend, their actions might be justified as a way to handle an uncomfortable situation. However, the method they chose (using earbuds and texting) might not be the most respectful approach.\n\nIn some contexts, silence or quiet reflection is expected in church, so using earbuds could be disruptive. Texting might also be seen as inappropriate. But if the person is passive and not causing a disturbance, maybe it's acceptable. The key factors are intent and the setting's expectations.\n\nThe parents' reaction is also important. If the person has already communicated their lack of belief, the parents' insistence on attendance without considering the child's feelings could be the main issue. The parents might be at fault for not respecting the child's autonomy, which could lead to conflict.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the person might not be in the wrong for trying to cope with being forced into a situation they disagree with. However, their method could be improved. The parents are also at fault for not respecting the child's beliefs and feelings. But the question is specifically about the person's actions. Given that, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the parents are forcing them, and the person is reacting to that pressure.\n"
