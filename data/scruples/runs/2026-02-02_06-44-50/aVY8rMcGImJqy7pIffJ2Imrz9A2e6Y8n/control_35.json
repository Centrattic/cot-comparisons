I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is forced to attend church by their parents even though they're an atheist. They brought earbuds and listened to music, texted a friend during the service. Their mom is upset, calling them negative.\n\nFirst, the parents are forcing a child to attend a religious service they don't believe in. That's a red flag. The child's autonomy is being violated. Even if the parents want to attend, forcing their child to come along, especially against their beliefs, isn't right. The child is an adult, presumably, since they're texting friends and making their own choices. \n\nThe child's actions are about coping with an unwanted situation. Using earbuds and texting might be seen as disrespectful in a religious setting, but the root issue is the parents forcing them to be there. The parents need to respect the child's beliefs and boundaries. The child isn't in the wrong because they're reacting to being forced into a situation they disagree with. The parents are the ones at fault for not respecting the child's autonomy and religious (or non-religious) views. So the answer should be B.\n"
