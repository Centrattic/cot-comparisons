I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a teenager who's forced to attend church with their parents, even though they're an atheist. The person mentions using earbuds and texting during the mass, which upset their mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the situation. The parents are taking their child to church against their will. The child is an atheist and has communicated this to the parents. The child's actions (listening to music, texting) are seen as disrespectful by the parents, who then criticize them. \n\nSo, the core issues here are parental authority and personal autonomy. The parents might believe that attending church is important, but the child doesn't share those beliefs. The child's actions are a form of protest or coping mechanism. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, is it wrong to use earbuds and text during a mass you're forced to attend? It depends on the context. In a church setting, there are usually social norms about behavior. However, the person is attending against their will, so their actions might be a way to deal with discomfort. \n\nLegally, parents can require their minor children to attend religious services in some places, but the ethics of forcing someone to participate in a religion they don't believe in is debatable. The child's actions could be seen as disrespectful, but if they're not there voluntarily, maybe the responsibility lies with the parents for forcing the attendance.\n\nThe parents are upset and called the child ungrateful. The child feels they're being forced to participate in something they dislike. So, the conflict is between the parents' desire for religious upbringing and the child's right to personal expression and belief.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's a bit nuanced. If the parents have the authority to require attendance, the child's actions could be seen as disrespectful. But if the parents are forcing the child to attend against their beliefs, then maybe the parents are at fault for not respecting the child's autonomy.\n\nI think the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B), because they're being honest about their beliefs and finding ways to cope with an uncomfortable situation. The parents might need to reconsider forcing their child to attend church if the child doesn't believe in it. However, it's a gray area since there's a cultural and religious expectation, but the child's actions are a form of personal resistance.\n"
