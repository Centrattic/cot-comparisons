I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe person is an atheist but forced to attend church with their parents every Sunday. They wear earbuds and listen to music, also texting a friend every 15 minutes. Their mom gives them dirty looks and later comments on their negative attitude. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The author is being forced to attend a church service they don't believe in. They've told their parents about their lack of belief, but the parents ignore that and still make them come. The author is using earbuds and texting to cope during the service. \n\nNow, from a religious perspective, maybe there's an expectation to be respectful and attentive during the mass. Wearing earbuds and texting could be seen as disrespectful, especially in a religious setting. But the author is an atheist and doesn't believe in the practices, so maybe their actions are a form of protest or just trying to pass the time. \n\nThe parents might feel that their child is being disrespectful, especially since they are in a place of worship. However, the parents are also forcing their child to attend against their beliefs, which could be seen as imposing their religious views on the child. \n\nThe key points here are the conflict between the parents' wishes and the child's beliefs. The child is being forced into a situation they find meaningless and is trying to cope by disengaging. The parents, on the other hand, might see the child's behavior as disrespectful to their religious practices. \n\nI think there's a balance here. The child has the right to not participate in a religion they don't believe in, but they might be expected to show some respect in the environment they're in, even if they don't share the beliefs. However, since they've been made to attend against their will, their actions might be more understandable. \n\nBut according to social norms, even in a place of worship, people are expected to act with certain decorum. So listening to music and texting during a service is usually considered disrespectful. However, if the person is being forced to attend and doesn't believe, their actions might be a form of coping rather than intentional disrespect. \n\nThe parents' reaction is also important. They are not respecting the child's beliefs by forcing them to attend, which is a problem. The child's response could be seen as a reaction to being forced into an uncomfortable situation. \n\nIn terms of who is at fault, the parents are forcing their child to attend a religion they don't believe in, which is problematic. The child is responding by disengaging during the service, which could be rude in a religious context but is a result of the parents' actions. So maybe the parents are more at fault here. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the parents are forcing them into a situation they don't believe in, and the author's actions are a reaction to that. However, there's a slight expectation of respect in any public setting, so the author might be partially in the wrong, but considering the context, the parents are more at fault.\n"
