I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the person is an atheist forced to attend church by their parents. They brought earbuds and checked their phone during the service, leading to their mom giving dirty looks and criticizing their attitude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is being forced to attend a religious service they don't believe in. That's a significant point. Parents making a child attend church against their beliefs might be an issue of respect for the child's autonomy. However, in many cultures, family traditions and parental authority play a big role. \n\nThe person is using earbuds and texting to cope with the situation. From their perspective, it's about dealing with boredom or discomfort. But from the parents' viewpoint, especially in a religious setting, using earbuds and checking phones might be seen as disrespectful. Churches often expect attendees to be present and attentive, and using technology could be viewed as a breach of etiquette or even a sign of disrespect towards the religious practices.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, they're being forced to attend a service they don't believe in, which is a valid grievance. On the other hand, their actions during the service (using earbuds, texting) could be seen as disrespectful in that context. The parents might feel that their efforts to attend church are being undermined, leading to tension.\n\nBut the key here is consent. If the person is being forced to attend a service they disagree with, their actions might be a form of passive resistance. However, in a public setting like church, there's an expectation of certain behavior, regardless of personal beliefs. So, even if they don't believe, is it reasonable to expect them to behave respectfully by not using earbuds and phones? Or is the parents' insistence on attending church with the child, despite their disinterest, the real issue?\n\nAlso, the parent's reaction\u2014calling them a \"bitch\" and criticizing their attitude\u2014might be an overreaction. But the child's actions could have been a trigger for that response.\n\nIn terms of social norms, churches do have expectations around behavior. So using earbuds and texting is likely to be seen as rude. However, if the child is forced to attend a place they find meaningless, their coping mechanisms might be justifiable. It's a conflict between parental authority and child's autonomy.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They might be, because even if they're forced to attend, using earbuds and texting is disrespectful in that setting. But if the parents are forcing them to attend against their will, that's a separate issue. The answer might depend on cultural norms and the specific family dynamics. However, in many cases, showing up and not engaging in the service in a respectful way could be seen as inconsiderate, even if the person doesn't believe.\n"
