I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a separated parent who has a court order for every weekend with his son. The ex-partner is asking for every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The author is hesitant to give up any of his time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, which typically means both parents are supposed to follow it unless it's modified. The mother is asking for a change, but the father is resisting. Without a court modification, changing the schedule might not be legally valid. So the father isn't necessarily in the wrong by sticking to the current order.\n\nEmotionally, both parents might be struggling. The mother is in school, which could be a legitimate reason for needing more time. But the father has limited time already (8 days a month) and values it a lot. The key here is that the court order exists for a reason, possibly to ensure both parents have consistent time. If the mother wants to change it, she should go through the legal process, not just ask the father to agree. \n\nThe father's refusal to adjust without a court order isn't being selfish; it's about upholding his legal rights. The mother's request might be reasonable, but she needs to follow the proper channels. So the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
