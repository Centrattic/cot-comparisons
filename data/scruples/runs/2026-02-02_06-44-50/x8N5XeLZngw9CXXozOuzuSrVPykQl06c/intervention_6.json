I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to give up their weekend time with their son. The situation is that the parents are separated, and there's a court order for the father to have the child every weekend. The mother wants to take every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The father is reluctant to give up any of his time because he looks forward to it and they have fun together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so the father's time is legally protected. The mother is asking for a change, but the father isn't obligated to agree unless the court modifies the order. So legally, he's not in the wrong because the existing agreement is binding unless changed through legal channels.\n\nThen, the emotional aspect. The father clearly values his time with his son, which is understandable. The mother is in school, which might be a legitimate reason for needing more time, but the current arrangement gives her 22 days a month. That's a significant amount. The father's time is already limited, and giving up even more could be seen as unfair, especially if the court order exists to ensure both parents have time.\n\nThe user initially thought the author might be in the wrong but is curious. The key points here are the legal standing and the balance of time. The mother's request is reasonable in intent, but the father isn't required to comply outside of the court's decision. Since the court order is in place, the father isn't being unreasonable by sticking to it. The mother should go through the legal process to modify the order if she feels the need, rather than expecting the father to give up time voluntarily.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). He's following the court order and just wants to maintain his scheduled time with his son. The mother's request is valid but should be addressed legally, not through the father's personal agreement.\n"
