I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to give up every second weekend with their son. The situation is that the parents are separated, and there's a court order in place. The mother wants the father to give up every other weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The father's time with the son is 8 days a month, while the mother has him 22 days.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since there's a court order, both parents are supposed to follow it. The father's time is already structured, so altering it without legal changes might not be appropriate. The mother is asking for more time, but the father is within his rights to maintain the current arrangement as long as it's court-mandated.\n\nThen, the emotional side. The father looks forward to every weekend and they have a good time. The mother says she's busy with school, but the father's time is already less than hers. The mother might be struggling to balance school and child care, but the father's time is limited. The key here is whether the court order is fair and if there's a process to modify it. If the mother wants to adjust the schedule, she should probably go through legal channels instead of asking the father directly. The father isn't obligated to change the agreement without a court modification. So, the author isn't in the wrong because they're adhering to the court order and it's reasonable to want to maintain their scheduled time, especially when it's already a minority share. The mother's request might be valid, but the father's stance is also understandable. Without a legal change, the father isn't violating anything, so the answer is B.\n"
