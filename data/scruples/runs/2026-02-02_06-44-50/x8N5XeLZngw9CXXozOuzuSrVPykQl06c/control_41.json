I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent who has a court order for visitation with their son every weekend. The other parent, the baby mother, is asking them to give up every second weekend so she can have more time with the kid since she's in school and it's hard for her.\n\nFirst, I need to remember that the author already has a court order in place. Court orders are legally binding and usually outline specific visitation rights. The fact that the other parent is asking to change the arrangement without going through the legal process might be an issue. The author's time is already set by the court, so unless the order is modified, they are within their rights to keep their scheduled time.\n\nThe numbers mentioned are important: the mother has the child 22 days a month, and the father has 8. That's a significant difference. The father's time is 8 out of 30, which is roughly a quarter of the month. The mother seems to have the majority of the time. The father is resisting giving up even more time, especially when he's looking forward to each weekend. \n\nThe mother's reason is that she's in school, making it hard to spend time with the child. But if she already has 22 days, maybe she's not using that time effectively? Or perhaps she's just not finding enough time because of her schedule. Either way, the father isn't the one who's creating the problem. The court order is the existing agreement, and unless there's a valid reason and a court modification, the father isn't obligated to give up his time.\n\nSo, the key points are the existing court order, the significant disparity in the time each parent has, and the fact that the request is coming without legal backing. The author isn't in the wrong because they are following the court order and have a right to their scheduled visitation. The other parent would need to go through the legal system to request a change, not ask the other parent directly. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
