I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not wanting to give up their weekend time with their son. The situation involves a court order that grants the author every other weekend with their child, and the ex-partner is requesting every second weekend. The author feels they already have a significant imbalance (8 days vs. 22) and don't want to lose more time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. The author has a court order, which is a legal document. Modifying custody arrangements typically requires legal proceedings, so the ex can't unilaterally change the agreement. The author isn't obligated to agree without going through the courts. So legally, the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nEmotionally, the author is attached to their time with the child, which is understandable. The ex is in school and claims it's hard to spend time with the child, but the court order already accounts for their time. The author's resistance is based on their own desire to maintain their schedule and bond with their son. \n\nThe key points are the existing court order and the fact that the ex is making a request that could require legal changes. The author isn't being selfish; they're upholding a legal agreement. The ex's situation (being in school) doesn't automatically mean the author should adjust the schedule without legal review. \n\nSo, the answer is B (Not in the wrong). The author isn't obligated to give up their time without legal changes. The request should be addressed through proper legal channels, not by the author agreeing to it on their own.\n"
