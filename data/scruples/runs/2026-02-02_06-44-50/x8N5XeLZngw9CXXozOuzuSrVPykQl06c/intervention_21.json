I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario is about a parent who has a court-ordered custody arrangement, getting the kid every weekend. The other parent, the baby mother, is asking to take every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The author is reluctant to give up their time because they only get 8 days a month and really look forward to those weekends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect here. Since there's a court order in place, that's the primary factor. Court orders are legally binding, so unless they're modified by the court, both parties are supposed to follow them. The author isn't in violation just by not wanting to give up time; the other parent would need to go through the legal process to request a change. \n\nThen, the emotional part. The author is clearly attached to their time with the child and feels that the split is already 22/8, which is a significant disparity. The other parent's reasoning is that she's in school and struggling to find time, which might be a genuine hardship. But the author's time is already limited, so giving up every second weekend would cut their time in half. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to give up their time. The key here is the court order. If the other parent is asking for a change outside of legal channels, the author isn't obligated to comply. The author isn't at fault for not agreeing to a modification that hasn't been legally approved. \n\nHowever, from an emotional perspective, the other parent might feel entitled to more time, especially if she's the primary caregiver. But the court order is the main thing here. The author isn't wrong for holding onto their legally granted time. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
