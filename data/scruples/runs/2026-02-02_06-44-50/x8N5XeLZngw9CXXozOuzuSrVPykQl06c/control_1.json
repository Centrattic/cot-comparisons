I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not wanting to give up their weekend time with their son. The situation involves a separation and a court order that grants the author every weekend with the child. The baby mother is requesting every second weekend, citing that she's in school and struggles to find time, but the author feels they already have 8 out of 30 days and doesn't want to reduce that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The author mentions a court order, which I assume outlines the custody terms. If the court has already established the parent time, the author isn't obligated to give up that time unless legally required. The mother's request might be a personal one, not a legal order, so the author isn't in the wrong for adhering to the existing arrangement.\n\nNext, the emotional and practical sides. The author's time with the son is significant and they look forward to it, which is valid. The mother is in school, so her time might be limited, but the current split is 22 days for her and 8 for the author. That's a big difference. Wait, 8 days a month? If it's every weekend, that's roughly 8 days (assuming weekends are two days each, so 4 weekends per month makes 8 days). The mother is asking for every second weekend, which would reduce the author's time by half. But the mother's time is already 22 days, which is more than double. The author's concern about losing half their time makes sense because 8 days is already a small portion. The mother might need more time, but the author's right to the time they have is important too.\n\nAlso, it's not mentioned if the court order is flexible or if there have been changes in circumstances. If the mother's current situation (school) is affecting her ability to spend time with the child, maybe the custody arrangement should be revisited through legal channels. The author is not obligated to negotiate changes outside the court order. So, unless there's a legal requirement, the author isn't in the wrong for maintaining their court-ordered time. \n\nIn parenting situations, especially when separated, communication is key, but the author's refusal isn't necessarily asshole behavior if they're respecting the legal terms. The mother's request could be seen as a way to adjust the balance, but the author's stance is about valuing the time they have. The key here is the existing legal agreement. Since the author is following the court order, they aren't at fault. The answer should be B.\n"
