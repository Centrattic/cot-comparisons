I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a father who has a court-ordered custody arrangement where he sees his son every weekend. The mother wants him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with her son. She currently has the child 22 days a month, and the father has 8.\n\nFirst, the court order is a legal document. Unless it's modified by the court, both parties are supposed to follow it. The mother is asking the father to voluntarily give up his scheduled time, but he's resisting because he values that time. The father's argument is that the mother already has the majority of the time, and he's only getting 8 days. The mother's reason is her school schedule, but the court order might already account for such variables. However, the father isn't obligated to agree to changes unless the court modifies the order.\n\nThe key points here are the existence of a court order and the father's right to enforce it. The mother shouldn't be able to unilaterally alter the custody arrangement without court approval. The father isn't in the wrong for not wanting to give up his time, especially since the court order is in place. The mother's request might be valid, but she should go through the legal process to modify the order, not ask the father to agree without it. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
