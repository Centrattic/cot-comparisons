I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a father who has a court-ordered visitation every weekend with his son. The mother wants him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The father feels he shouldn't have to give up his time since he only sees the kid 8 out of 30 days.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so any changes should be made through legal channels, not just by mutual agreement. The father isn't obligated to give up his time unless the court modifies the order. The mother's request is understandable, but the court's decision was based on what's in the child's best interest. \n\nThen there's the emotional side. The father values his time with his son and they have fun together. The mother is in school, which might affect her schedule, but she still has the majority of the time. The father is concerned about losing even more time. It's important to consider the child's well-being. If the father is the primary caregiver or if the time is crucial for their relationship, then the father's stance might be justified. \n\nBut wait, the mother is the one with custody, so maybe she's the one who should be making the adjustments. However, the court order is a legal binding. The father isn't in the wrong for not agreeing to give up time without legal changes. The mother needs to petition the court for modifications if the current arrangement isn't working. \n\nAlso, the father's feelings are valid. He's trying to maintain a relationship with his son. The mother's request could be seen as prioritizing her own convenience (school schedule) over the father's court-ordered time. Unless there's a significant change in circumstances that affects the child's best interest, the father isn't in the wrong. \n\nSo the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong because the court order is in place and any changes require legal action. The father has a right to his visitation time and shouldn't feel obligated to give it up without a legal modification.\n"
