I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent who has a court-ordered visitation schedule, getting the child every weekend. The other parent is asking to take every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the kid. The author is reluctant to give up their time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so any changes would typically require legal modification. The mother is asking for a change without going through the court, which might not be valid. The father's time is protected by the order, so he's not obligated to give it up unless the court decides otherwise.\n\nEmotionally, both parents want time with their child. The mother feels she needs more time because of her studies, but she already has the child 22 days a month. The father values his weekend visits and doesn't want to lose them. From a fairness standpoint, the current arrangement gives the mother the majority of the time. The father's share is already smaller, so giving up more might be unfair unless there's a mutual agreement or court ruling.\n\nThe mother's reasoning about school is understandable, but maybe she could find other solutions, like adjusting her schedule during the week. However, the father isn't in the wrong for not wanting to relinquish his time, especially since the court order is in place. The key here is that legal agreements should be modified through proper channels, not unilaterally. The father isn't obligated to comply with her request outside of the court's decision. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
