I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent's visitation rights with their son.\n\nThe parent has a court order for every weekend, which is about 8 days a month. The mother wants to take every second weekend, so maybe she would have him 22 days? Wait, the original problem says the mother already has 22/30 days and the father has 8. Wait, the user says that the mother is asking for every second weekend, but he's confused because he already has a court order. \n\nFirst, the court order is in place. The mother is requesting more time, but the father is reluctant to give up his scheduled time. The key here is the court order. If the mother wants to change the custody arrangement, she would need to go through the legal system. The father isn't obligated to agree unless the court decides otherwise. \n\nThe father's argument is that he's already getting 8 days a month, which is significantly less than the mother. The mother is in school, but the father's time is something he values and looks forward to. The court order was established for a reason, so altering it without legal proceedings might not be valid. \n\nThe user is asking if the dad is the asshole for not giving up his time. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong) because the court order is in place, and he's not obligated to give up his time without a court decision. The mother should go through the proper legal channels to request a change, not ask him directly. The father isn't being unreasonable by sticking to the court's decision unless there's a valid reason to modify the order. So, the answer is B.\n"
