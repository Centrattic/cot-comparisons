Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a parent who's been separated from the baby's mother since just after the son was born, about three years ago. They have a court order that gives them time with their son every weekend. Last night at drop-off, the baby's mother asked the author to give up every second weekend because she says she doesn't get enough time with him. The author is asking if they're the asshole for not wanting to give up any of their time.\n\nFirst, there's a court order in place. That's important because it's a legal agreement. The mother is asking the author to voluntarily give up part of that time, but the author is resisting. The author points out that the mother already has the child 22 out of 30 days a month, which is like 73% of the time, while the author only gets 8 days, about 27%. The mother is in school, which she says makes it hard to spend time with the child. The author values their weekends and doesn't want to lose any time.\n\nSo, the key factors here are the court order, the existing custody arrangement, and the mother's request. The court order is legally binding, so the author isn't obligated to change it unless there's a legal process. The mother's reasoning is that she's in school and thus has limited time, but the author is already getting the minimum under the current arrangement. The author is simply not willing to give up time without a legal change, which seems reasonable. The mother might need to go through the court to modify the order if she wants to adjust the custody arrangement. The author isn't being selfish; they're protecting their legally protected time with their son. So, the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
