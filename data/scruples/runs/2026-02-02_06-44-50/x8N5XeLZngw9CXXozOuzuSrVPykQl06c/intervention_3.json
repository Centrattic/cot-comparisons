I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not wanting to give up their weekend time with their son. The situation is that the author has a court-ordered custody arrangement where they get their son every weekend. The ex wants every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so the author's time is legally protected. The ex wants to modify the arrangement, but the author doesn't want to. The court order was established for a reason, maybe to ensure both parents have time. The ex's reasoning is that she's in school and has less time, but the author already has 22 out of 30 days with the child. Wait, wait, the author says the ex has 22 days and he has 8. Wait, no, the original post says the author has 8 days a month (every weekend), and the ex has 22. But the author's time is 8 days, which is less than half the month. So the ex is asking for every second weekend, which would reduce the author's time even more. But the author's time is already a minority. \n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. The author's time is set by court. The ex wants a change, but the author is not obligated to agree unless the court modifies the order. So legally, the author isn't in the wrong. The ex would need to go through the court to change the arrangement. The author isn't obligated to give up their court-ordered time unless the court decides otherwise.\n\nEmotionally, the author is attached to their time and the child looks forward to it. The ex's situation is that she's in school, which is a valid reason, but she already has the majority of the time. Maybe she's not using the 22 days effectively or has conflicting schedules. The author is not at fault for not wanting to reduce their time. The court order is in place for a reason, so the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
