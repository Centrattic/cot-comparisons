I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of a \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent who has a court-ordered custody arrangement where they get their son every weekend, totaling about 8 days a month. The other parent (the baby mother) wants to take every second weekend, reducing the first parent's time. The author is resisting this change.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since there's a court order in place, any changes to custody should ideally go through legal channels. The baby mother's request might be valid, but she's approaching the other parent directly instead of modifying the court order. That could be a point in the author's favor because they're not legally obligated to agree to the change unless the court modifies the order.\n\nFrom an emotional standpoint, the author is clearly attached to their son and values the time they have. The split is already 22/30 days for the other parent, which is a significant majority. The author's time is a smaller portion, so giving up even part of that could be hard. The baby mother's reason is that she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. However, if the current arrangement already gives her most of the time, maybe her issue is not the total time but the distribution. But the author isn't responsible for modifying the court order on their own.\n\nThe key here is that the author isn't the one initiating the change. The court order is the current legal agreement. The other parent is asking for a modification without legal process. The author isn't in the wrong for not agreeing unless the court decides otherwise. So the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
