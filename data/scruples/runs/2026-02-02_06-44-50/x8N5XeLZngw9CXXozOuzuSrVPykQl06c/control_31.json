I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent who has a court-ordered custody arrangement, getting every weekend with their son. The other parent wants every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to manage. The author is resisting giving up that time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so any changes would likely require modifying the custody arrangement through the court. The mother can't just unilaterally take more time without legal approval. The father has a legal right to his scheduled time unless a court decides otherwise.\n\nThen there's the emotional and practical side. The father is clearly attached to his son, looking forward to the weekends, and they have a good time. The mother is in school, which might make her schedule tight, but the current arrangement is 22 days to her and 8 to him. The numbers seem quite skewed. Typically, custody arrangements aim for a balance, but sometimes one parent has more days. However, 22 vs. 8 is a big difference. Maybe the court order was set that way for a reason, like the mother being the primary caregiver. But if the father is following the court order, he's within his rights.\n\nThe mother's request could be a valid concern if the court order isn't meeting the child's needs. But the father is not obligated to agree without a court modification. The question is whether the father is in the wrong for not giving up his time. Since he's adhering to the legal order and the mother's request isn't legally binding without a court change, the father isn't in the wrong. The mother should go through the proper legal channels to request a modification if she needs more time. The father's feelings about spending time with his son are valid, and he's not obligated to sacrifice his court-ordered time without a legal decision. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
