I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's figure this out. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for not wanting to give up some of their time with their son. The situation is that they have a court order for every weekend, and the mother wants them to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the kid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. There's a court order in place, which legally binds the parent time. So unless the court modifies the order, both parties have to follow it. The mother is requesting a change, but the father is resisting. Since the court order is already established, the father isn't violating anything by not complying with her request. So legally, he's not in the wrong.\n\nNext, the emotional side. The father values his time with his son and has a bond. The mother is trying to adjust because of her school schedule, but the father is concerned about losing time. The mother already has the child 22 days a month, which is more than the father's 8. The father's request for his time to stay the same seems reasonable. \n\nBut maybe the mother's argument is that her schedule is harder now. However, the court order is in place for a reason, perhaps considering both parents' circumstances when it was made. If the mother's situation has changed, maybe she should petition the court for a modification. The father isn't obligated to agree without a court change. \n\nSo, the father isn't in the wrong for sticking to the court order. The mother's request is her responsibility to address through legal channels, not unilaterally. The father's attachment and the court's decision are key points here. The answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong."
