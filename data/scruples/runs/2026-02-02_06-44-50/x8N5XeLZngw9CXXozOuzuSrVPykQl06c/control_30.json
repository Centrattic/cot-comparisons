I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a parent who has a court-ordered custody arrangement where they get every weekend with their son. The other parent, the baby mother, is asking for every second weekend to increase her time because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The author is resisting because they already have 8 days a month and don't want to give up any of that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, which means the current custody schedule is legally binding. If the baby mother wants changes, she should probably go through the legal system to modify the order. The author isn't obligated to agree to changes outside of a court decision. So legally, the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nThen there's the emotional and practical side. The author is attached to their time with their child and the other parent has a valid reason (being in school). But the author's time is already limited, and they value their weekends. The baby mother has 22 days out of 30, which is more than the other parent. The question is whether the author is selfish for not wanting to give up some time. But the custody arrangement is supposed to balance both parents' needs. Since the current arrangement is court-ordered, the author isn't obligated to make unilateral changes. The baby mother's request is reasonable, but the author isn't wrong for not agreeing. They should both communicate and possibly adjust through legal channels. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
