I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about child custody time.\n\nThe father has a court order for every weekend with his son. The mother wants him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. She already has the child 22 days a month, and he has 8. He's reluctant to give up his time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. The court order is in place, so changing it would require legal steps. The mother's request is outside the court's decision. The father has a right to his scheduled time unless the court modifies it. So legally, he's not in the wrong.\n\nEmotionally, both parents want time with their child. The mother's hardship with school is a valid reason, but the father's time is also precious. The key here is that the court order is the binding agreement. The mother's unilateral request doesn't override that unless the court agrees. The father isn't obligated to give up his time beyond what's ordered. So he's not the asshole here. Answer B makes sense."
