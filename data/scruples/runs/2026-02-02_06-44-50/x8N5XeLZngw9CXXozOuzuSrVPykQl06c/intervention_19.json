I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent who has a court-ordered visitation schedule with their son every weekend. The other parent, the baby mom, is asking for every second weekend because she feels she doesn't get enough time with the child. The author is reluctant to give up their time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so any changes to the schedule would require some form of agreement or court modification. If the court order isn't being changed, then the author is following the existing agreement. So, from a legal standpoint, the author isn't in the wrong unless the court order is modified.\n\nEmotionally, both parents want time with their child. The baby mom is in school, which might make her time management harder. However, the current arrangement is 22 days to the mother and 8 to the father. If the mother is asking for every second weekend, that might be a reasonable request, especially if her circumstances have changed (like being in school). But the father is attached to his time, which is understandable. \n\nBut the key point is the court order. If the mother wants to change the schedule, she needs to go through the legal process. The father isn't obligated to agree unless the court modifies the order. So, unless the father is violating the court order, he's not in the wrong. \n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but maybe they're not. The father is legally entitled to his visitation time as per the court. The mother's request doesn't change that unless legally altered. So the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
