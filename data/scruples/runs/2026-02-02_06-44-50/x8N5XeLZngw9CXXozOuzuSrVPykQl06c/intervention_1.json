I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong by not wanting to give up every second weekend with his son. The situation is that the parents are separated, and there's a court-ordered custody arrangement where the author sees his son every weekend. The mother wants to take every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The author is hesitant to give up his time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so any changes would need to be through legal channels. The author isn't obligated to agree to changes unless the court modifies the order. The mother's request is outside the current agreement, so the author isn't necessarily in the wrong by refusing. \n\nThen, the emotional aspect. Both parents want time with their child, which is natural. The mother is in school, which might be a legitimate reason for her to seek more time. However, the current split is 22 vs. 8 days a month, which is a significant disparity. The author's time is limited, and he values it a lot. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the court order is valid and the mother is asking for a change without going through the legal process, the author has the right to maintain his time. However, maybe the mother's situation is genuine, and the author could be flexible. But the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but they want confirmation.\n\nLegal perspective is key here. Without a court modification, the author isn't violating anything by not complying. The mother should petition the court for a change. So the author isn't in the wrong for sticking to the current agreement. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
