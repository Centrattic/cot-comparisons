I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent who has a court-ordered visitation schedule with their son. The other parent, the baby's mother, is asking to take every second weekend, reducing the first parent's time. The author is asking if they're an asshole for not wanting to give up their time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the court order aspect. If the court has already set the visitation schedule, that's a legal agreement both parties are supposed to follow. The mother is requesting a change without going through the proper legal channels. The author isn't at fault for not complying with an informal request that could alter a court order. \n\nThe mother's argument is that she's in school and has difficulty. But she already has the majority of the time with the child. The author's concern is valid because they're looking forward to their weekends and have a set schedule. The key point here is that any changes to a court order typically require legal proceedings. The author isn't in the wrong for sticking to the existing order and not unilaterally altering it without legal discussion.\n\nSo, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong. They\u2019re maintaining their court-ordered time, which is their right. The mother should seek a legal modification if she wants changes, not just ask informally. The author isn\u2019t being selfish; they\u2019re upholding a legal agreement.\n"
