I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is the asshole in this situation. The author has a court order for every weekend with their son, and the baby mom wants them to give up every second weekend because she's busy with school. The author is resisting because they already have 8 days a month and she has 22.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since there's a court order in place, the author's custody time is legally protected. The mother can't just unilaterally decide to take more time without going through the legal process. Courts typically set custody arrangements based on the child's best interests, so the author isn't obligated to give up their scheduled time unless there's a change in circumstances and a court modifies the order.\n\nThen, the emotional side. The author clearly values their time with the child and looks forward to it. They mention having fun together, which suggests a strong bond. The mother, on the other hand, is in school, which might be a legitimate reason for needing more flexibility, but the author's time is already minimal compared to the mother's. It's possible the mother isn't using her time effectively, but the author isn't the one responsible for that.\n\nI should also think about common custody arrangements. 8 days a month is quite limited, but since the mother has 22, maybe there's another arrangement, like mid-week visits. However, the author isn't in a position to unilaterally adjust the court order. The mother should petition the court if she believes the current arrangement isn't working, but the author isn't at fault for not complying without legal changes.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author could be more flexible, but the mother already has more time. The author's right to scheduled visitation is important. They can't be forced to give up time without legal proceedings. So, the answer is likely B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
