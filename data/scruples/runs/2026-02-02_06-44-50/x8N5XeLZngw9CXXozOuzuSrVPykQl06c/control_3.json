I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a father who has a court-ordered every weekend visitation with his son, and the mother is asking him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the kid. He's hesitant to give up his time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The father has a court order, which is a legal agreement. The mother is asking him to change the arrangement outside of the court's decision. So by law, he's not obligated to comply unless the court modifies the order. The mother's request is a personal one, not a legal requirement.\n\nThen there's the emotional angle. Both parents want time with their child, which is natural. The mother is in school, which is a valid reason for time constraints, but the current arrangement gives her 22 days and the father 8. The father is worried about losing his time, which he looks forward to. It's important for both parents to have a relationship with the child, but the court order is already in place for a reason. Changing it unilaterally could lead to conflict.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the father's time is limited, and the mother is the custodial parent. She's the one with the child most of the time. The father's time is structured. If the mother is struggling, maybe she can find other ways to spend time with the child during the 22 days she has him. The father isn't in the wrong for not wanting to give up his court-ordered time. The mother should go through the proper legal channels if she wants a modification, not approach the other parent directly.\n\nSo the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. He's following the court order and has a right to his visitation time. The mother's request is outside the legal framework, so he's justified in not agreeing without court approval.\n"
