I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down. The situation is that the author is a parent who has a court-ordered custody arrangement. They get their son every weekend, which is about 8 days a month, while the other parent, the baby mother, has him 22 days. The baby mother is now asking to switch every second weekend, which would reduce the author's time further.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so any changes would typically require mutual agreement or a court modification. The baby mother can't just unilaterally decide to take more time without the other parent's consent or a court order. The author is within their legal rights to not comply with an informal request that changes the existing agreement.\n\nFrom an emotional perspective, the author clearly values their time with the son and looks forward to the weekends. The other parent is in school, which she says makes it hard to spend time with the child. However, the existing arrangement already gives her the majority of the time. The author's resistance is about maintaining the court-ordered time, which is reasonable.\n\nI should also think about fairness. If the baby mother already has 22 days, which is more than two-thirds of the month, asking for every second weekend would take away even more time from the author. The author's stance is about protecting their scheduled time, which is a valid concern. The other parent's needs don't necessarily outweigh the legal agreement and the existing schedule unless there's a legitimate reason that requires a court's intervention.\n\nThere's also the aspect of communication. The baby mother approached during drop-off, which might be a stressful time. The author's response is about not wanting to lose time, which is a natural parental feeling. The key here is that the court order is the binding factor. Without a court modification, the author isn't obligated to give up time. So the author isn't being an asshole by holding onto their court-ordered custody days. The real issue here is the other parent's request without proper legal channels. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
