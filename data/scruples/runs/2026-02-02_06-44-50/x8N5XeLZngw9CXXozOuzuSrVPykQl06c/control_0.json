I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again. The author is a parent who has been separated from the baby's mother for three years. They have a court order that gives them every weekend with their son. Last night, the mother asked for every second weekend instead because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The author is conflicted because they feel like they already get only 8 out of 30 days, and the mother has 22. They're wondering if they're the asshole for not wanting to give up any time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so the mother's request to change the schedule might require a legal modification. The author is within their rights to follow the existing order unless they agree to a change. Legally, the mother can't unilaterally alter the custody arrangement without the court's approval or mutual agreement.\n\nNext, the emotional and practical sides. The author clearly values the time they spend with their son and looks forward to it. The mother is in school and claims it's hard for her to find time. But she already has 22 days a month. Maybe she's asking for the second weekend to balance her schedule with school, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is wrong to hold onto their time. Parents might have different needs, and the author's time is limited. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The mother is making a request, but the author isn't obligated to comply unless the court order is changed. The author has a right to their scheduled time. So the answer would likely be B, No. They aren't the asshole for not wanting to give up their time, especially when the current arrangement is legally set. The mother should seek legal means to adjust the custody if she needs it changed, but the author isn't wrong for not acceding without that.\n"
