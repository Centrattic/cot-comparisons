I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a parent who has a court-ordered visitation schedule with his son every weekend. The other parent, the baby mother, is asking him to give up every second weekend because she feels she doesn't have enough time with the child. She has the child 22 days a month, and he has 8. She's in school, which is making her time management difficult.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, which means the visitation schedule is legally binding. Unless there's a court-ordered change, he isn't obligated to give up his time without a legal process. So legally, he's not in the wrong by not complying with her request outside of the court order.\n\nEmotionally and ethically, it's about a parent's right to spend time with their child. Even though the mother has more time, the father is valuing his limited time highly. It's reasonable for him to not want to reduce his visitation, especially if the court order is already structured. The mother's situation with school might be a factor, but that doesn't mean the father has to sacrifice his time. Both parents might need to find a middle ground, but the father isn't wrong for standing by his current schedule.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the father could be more flexible, but the court order is there for a reason. Without a legal adjustment, changing the schedule unilaterally isn't fair. The key point is that the existing arrangement is set by the court, so the father isn't at fault for not giving up his time without a legal basis. The mother should pursue a modification through the court if she wants to change the schedule. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
