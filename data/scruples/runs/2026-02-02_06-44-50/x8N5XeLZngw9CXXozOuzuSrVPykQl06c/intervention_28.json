I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a father who has a court-ordered custody arrangement where he gets to see his son every weekend. The mother wants him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The father is reluctant because he only gets 8 days a month and looks forward to those weekends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so changing it would require legal steps. The mother's request is just a request, not a legal change. The father isn't obligated to agree unless the court modifies the order. So legally, he's not in the wrong.\n\nEmotionally, both parents probably want more time with their child. The mother is in school, which might be a valid reason for needing more time, but the father's concern is losing the time he already has. The key point is that the custody arrangement is already set. The father's refusal isn't against the court order. The mother should pursue legal avenues if she wants changes. The father isn't being selfish; he's protecting his court-ordered time. So, from a legal and parental rights perspective, the answer would be B (not in the wrong). The mother's request is reasonable, but the father isn't obligated to comply without legal modification.\n"
