I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a parent who has a court-ordered custody arrangement where they see their son every weekend. The other parent, the baby's mother, is asking to take every second weekend to have more time with the child because she's in school and finds it hard to manage. The parent in question doesn't want to give up any of their time, feeling it's important to maintain their bond.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, which means the custody arrangement is legally binding. The mother is requesting changes outside of that order. Legally, unless the court modifies the order, the current arrangement stands. So, the author isn't violating any laws by not complying with the request. That's a key point.\n\nNext, the emotional and practical sides. The parent has limited time with the child (8 days a month) and the mother has the rest. The mother's reason is that she's in school and can't find time, but she already has the child for 22 days. The parent feels their time is precious and they look forward to it. It's understandable for them to resist giving up that time, especially since the arrangement is already set by the court.\n\nThe mother's request might be based on her current challenges, but the existing custody schedule is supposed to address the time split. If the schedule isn't working for her, the proper way would be to seek a legal modification, not to unilaterally ask the other parent to give up their court-ordered time. The author isn't obligated to agree without a court order change.\n\nAlso, the parent's attachment and the importance of maintaining their relationship with the child are valid. Losing a significant portion of their time could affect their bonding. The mother's situation isn't invalid, but the solution should involve legal channels rather than expecting the other parent to sacrifice their time without a formal adjustment.\n\nSo, considering the legal framework and the emotional impact, the author isn't in the wrong. The mother should pursue a legal modification if she's unhappy with the current arrangement. The answer should be B (No).\n"
