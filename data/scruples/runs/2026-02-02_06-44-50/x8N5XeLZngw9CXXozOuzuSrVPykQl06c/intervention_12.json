I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a parent who has a court order for every weekend with their son, and the other parent wants them to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The author is wondering if they're the asshole for not wanting to give up any time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The user mentioned there's a court order in place. If the court order specifies the visitation schedule, then changing it would require going through legal channels. The other parent can't just demand changes without the court's approval. So, if the author is following the court order, they're within their rights. \n\nThen there's the emotional side. The author is a parent who looks forward to their time with the child and they have fun together. It's natural for a parent to want quality time with their child. The other parent is in school and claims it's hard for her to have time with the child. But according to the numbers, the other parent already has him 22 out of 30 days. That's a significant amount of time, so the author's 8 days might seem small, but they're the scheduled time. \n\nBut wait, maybe the other parent is struggling with her own schedule. However, the court order is there for a reason, possibly to ensure both parents have consistent time. The author isn't obligated to give up their time unless the court modifies the order. \n\nI should also think about the child's best interest. The court typically considers that when setting visitation. If the current arrangement is working, changing it could disrupt the child's routine. The other parent might need more time, but that doesn't mean the author has to give it up without legal process. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the court order is in place, then the author isn't violating any laws by sticking to it. The other parent's request is outside the legal agreement. So the author isn't in the wrong for not complying with the request. \n\nBut maybe there's an expectation of flexibility. However, the court order is a binding legal document. The other parent should approach the court if she wants modifications, not the other parent directly. So the author isn't being unreasonable by not giving up their time. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
