I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation is about custody time with their son.\n\nThe parent has a court order for every weekend, which is 8 days a month. The baby mother, who has the child 22 days a month, is asking to take every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard. The author is resisting because they value their time with the son and don't want to give up any of it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so unless there's a modification, the parent is following the law. The other parent is requesting a change, which would require legal action. The author isn't obligated to comply without the court's approval. \n\nNext, the emotional and practical sides. The author mentions they look forward to the weekends and have fun. The other parent is in school, which might be a valid hardship, but the current arrangement gives her the majority of the time. Maybe she's asking for more flexibility, but the author's time is fixed by the court. \n\nThe key points are the existing legal agreement and the balance of time. The author isn't being unreasonable by sticking to the court order. The request from the baby mother isn't something the author has to fulfill unless the court changes the order. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're adhering to the court's decision and it's not their responsibility to give up scheduled time without legal changes.\n"
