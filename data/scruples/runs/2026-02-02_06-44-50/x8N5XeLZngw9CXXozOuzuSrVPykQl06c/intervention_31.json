I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation involves a separated parent with a court-ordered visitation schedule. The mother wants the father to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with their son. The father is reluctant to give up his time since he only has the child 8 out of 30 days.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The father has a court order for his time. Unless the court modifies the order, he isn't obligated to give up his scheduled time. So legally, he might not be in the wrong. However, the mother's situation is that she's in school, which could imply she's busy. But the father's time is already limited. The question is about whether the father is being unreasonable by not wanting to give up his time.\n\nEmotionally, both parents probably want to spend time with their child. The father has a set schedule and maybe sees this time as crucial. The mother feels she needs more time. But the problem is the existing court order. If the mother wants to change the schedule, she should probably go through the legal system rather than ask the father directly. The father isn't required to comply without a court modification. So from a legal standpoint, the father isn't in the wrong. From a moral or emotional standpoint, maybe the father isn't being considerate, but the question is whether he's \"in the wrong,\" which might tie more to legal obligations. So the answer is likely B (No).\n"
