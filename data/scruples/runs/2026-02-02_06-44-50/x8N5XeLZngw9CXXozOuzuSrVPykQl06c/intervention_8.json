I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a father who has a court-ordered custody arrangement, where he gets every weekend with his son. The mother wants him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The father is reluctant because he only has 8 days a month and values that time a lot.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so any changes would typically require mutual agreement or a court modification. The mother's request is essentially asking the father to unilaterally alter the custody arrangement, which he's not obligated to do. Courts usually require both parties to agree on changes, especially if the order was established for the child's best interest.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The father clearly values his time with the son, and the mother is in a situation where her school commitments are affecting her ability to spend time with the child. But the current split is 22/8, which is a significant disparity. The father's stance is about maintaining his scheduled time, which is legally protected. The mother's request could be seen as selfish if she's already having the majority of the time. However, she's also facing her own challenges due to school. \n\nThe key here is that the father is not the one proposing the change; the mother is making the request, and he's declining. Since the custody arrangement is court-ordered, he isn't violating any rules by refusing. The mother would need to go through the legal system to request a modification, which the father can certainly oppose. The father's refusal isn't necessarily selfish; it's about upholding the existing agreement. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the father isn't in the wrong for sticking to the court order. The mother's request isn't something he has to agree to without a legal process. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
