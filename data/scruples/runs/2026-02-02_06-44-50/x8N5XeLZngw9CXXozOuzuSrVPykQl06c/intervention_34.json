I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent who's been separated for three years and has a court-ordered visitation every weekend. The other parent, the baby mother, is asking for every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The author is reluctant to give up their time.\n\nFirst, the court order is a legal agreement. So any changes to it would typically require a court modification. The baby mother is asking for a change, but the author is resisting. The key points here are the existing legal agreement and the fairness of the requested change.\n\nThe author's time is 8 days a month, while the other parent has 22. If the mother is in school, maybe her availability is limited. But the court order was set for a reason. The author might be worried about losing time, which is understandable. However, the mother is asking for a modification, which might be necessary if her circumstances have changed. \n\nBut the author isn't the one asking for a change; they're just resisting the other parent's request. The court order is in place, so unless the mother goes through the legal process to modify it, the author isn't obligated to comply. The author isn't in the wrong for not giving up their time without a court modification. The mother should pursue legal channels if she wants to change the arrangement. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
