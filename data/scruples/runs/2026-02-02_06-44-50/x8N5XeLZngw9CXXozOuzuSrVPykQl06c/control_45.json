I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a father who has a court-ordered custody arrangement where he gets to see his son every weekend. The mother wants him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The father doesn't want to lose any of his time and is seeking validation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so any changes would need to comply with that. The father is following the existing arrangement, so legally, he might not be in the wrong. The mother is requesting a change, but the court order is a binding document. Without a legal modification, he isn't obligated to change it.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The father values his time with his son and looks forward to it. The mother wants more time because she's busy with school, but she already has the child 22 days a month. The question is whether the father is being selfish by not giving up his time. But considering the custody split, the mother has significantly more time. The father's time is a smaller portion, so it's reasonable that he wants to hold onto it.\n\nAnother angle: the mother's reasoning. She's in school, but she's the primary caregiver, so maybe she's managing her time to balance school and raising the child. If she's the one who has him most of the time, perhaps the father's time is more limited and precious. The court order likely reflects the initial custody agreement, and unless there's a change in circumstances (like the father's ability to care for the child), the arrangement should stay.\n\nAlso, communication is key. The mother approached him directly, but major changes should go through legal channels. If the court order isn't being followed, that could be an issue. But if it's a request, the father isn't obligated to agree. So he's not in the wrong for not complying with her request.\n\nIn terms of emotional support, both parents want time with their child. The mother's need for more time might be genuine, but the father's feelings are valid too. However, since the court order is already set, the father isn't the asshole for not giving up his time. The mother should pursue legal means to modify the custody if she needs it, but the father isn't obligated to do so on his own.\n\nSo the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
