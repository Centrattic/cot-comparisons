I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about custody time with a child. The parent has a court order for every weekend with his son. The mother wants him to give up every second weekend because she's busy with school and feels she doesn't have enough time. The parent is resisting because he only gets 8 days a month and doesn't want to lose any time.\n\nFirst, the court order is key here. If there's a legal agreement in place, changing it probably requires going through the legal system, not just an agreement between the two parents. So if the mother is asking the father to voluntarily give up time, that's different from the court modifying the order. The father's time is limited, so he might feel it's unjust to reduce it further without a legal change.\n\nThe mother's reasoning is that she's in school and has time issues. But she already has 22 days a month, which is the majority. The father is concerned about losing time, which is understandable because he's been separated and the weekends are his only time. The question is whether it's fair for the mother to ask for more time without the court's involvement.\n\nLegally, the father's agreement isn't necessary if the court order is in place. The mother would need to petition the court to modify the custody arrangement. Since the father doesn't want to give up time without a legal change, he's probably not in the wrong. The mother's request without going through the court might not be valid. The father's attachment to his time and the legal standing points to him not being in the wrong. So the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong."
