I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent (the author) who has a court-ordered custody arrangement where they see their son every weekend. The other parent, the baby mother, is asking for every second weekend to spend more time with the child because she's in school and finds it hard. The author is hesitant to give up any time, feeling they already have a limited 8 days a month. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The author has a court order, which is a legal document. Modifying custody arrangements typically requires legal processes. The mother is asking to change the existing order without going through the court, which might not be valid. So, if the court order is in place, the author isn't obligated to give up time unless the court modifies it.\n\nEmotionally, both parents want time with their child. The mother argues she's in school, which complicates her schedule. However, the author's time is already 8 days a month, which is a significant chunk. The mother has 22 days, so maybe she's not as constrained as she claims. The author is concerned about losing time, which is understandable since they look forward to the weekends.\n\nI should check if the court order allows for modifications. If the order is flexible or if there's a process for negotiation, maybe they should discuss it legally. But since the mother is asking without legal process, the author isn't necessarily wrong to hold their ground. The author's right to the court-ordered time is protected unless there's a legal change. So, the author isn't in the wrong for not giving up the time unilaterally. The answer should be B.\n"
