I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a separated parent who has a court-ordered visitation every weekend. The other parent, the baby mother, wants him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with their son. The author is asking if not wanting to give up that time makes him the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the legal aspect. The key point here is that there's a court order in place. Court orders are legally binding, so unless there's a court-approved modification, either parent can't unilaterally change the terms. The baby mother is asking the author to give up his time without going through the court, which might be a legal issue. The author is following the court order, so he's within his rights.\n\nNext, the time split: the mother has the child 22 days a month, and the father has 8 days. That's a significant majority for the mother. The father is concerned about losing every other weekend, which would reduce his time even more. The mother's argument is that she's in school, but she's already the primary caregiver. The father's time is limited, and he's using it to bond with his son. It's understandable that he wouldn't want to lose that time.\n\nEmotionally, the father is attached to his son and looks forward to the weekends. The mother's request might be selfish in this context, as she's already getting more time. However, the mother's situation with school might be a real challenge. But the solution shouldn't be to take away the father's court-ordered time. Instead, the mother should seek a legal modification if she's struggling.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. He's following the court order and has a right to his visitation. The mother's request is outside the legal framework. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
