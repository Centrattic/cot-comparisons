I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves custody and visitation rights for their son.\n\nFirst, the parent has a court order that grants them every weekend with their son. The other parent, the baby mother, is asking to take every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The mother already has the kid 22 days a month, which is about 73% of the time, while the father has him 8 days, around 27%. \n\nThe key here is the existing court order. If the court order is legally binding, then modifying it would typically require going back to court, not just an agreement between the parents. The father is within his rights to follow the court order as it stands. The mother's request might be reasonable, but the father isn't obligated to agree unless the court modifies the order. \n\nAlso, the father's time with his son is limited, and he's using it to build a relationship. It's understandable he doesn't want to give that up. The mother's argument about school is a personal challenge, but the father isn't responsible for her schedule. \n\nIn legal terms, unless the court decides otherwise, the father isn't in the wrong for not giving up his scheduled time. The correct approach here would be for the mother to petition the court to adjust the visitation schedule, not to unilaterally request changes. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
