I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not wanting to give up every second weekend with their son. The situation is that the father has a court order for weekly parenting time, but the mother wants him to give up every other weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The father has a court order, which means the current arrangement is legally binding. Unless the mother can prove that the arrangement is harmful to the child or if there's a change in circumstances, the court might not agree to a modification. So legally, the father isn't in the wrong by following the existing order.\n\nThen there's the emotional and practical side. The father values his time with the son and they have a good relationship. The mother is in school, which is a temporary situation, but she's already got 22 days a month. The father's time is 8 days, which is less than a third. It's understandable he doesn't want to lose even that. However, the mother might be struggling with balancing her school and parenting responsibilities. Maybe the father could offer some flexibility without giving up entire weekends, like adjusting the time slightly or offering mid-week visits. But the mother is asking for a significant change, which could be a stretch.\n\nI should also think about the child's best interest. More time with the mother if she can manage it might be beneficial, but if her school is making it hard to spend quality time, maybe the current arrangement is actually better. The father isn't refusing all time; he's just not willing to sacrifice every other weekend. \n\nThe key points are the existing court order, the balance of time, and the mother's current challenges. The father isn't violating the law, and given the time split, he's already in a minority. It's his right to defend his scheduled time unless the court modifies it. So the answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. But I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing. Maybe the mother's request is reasonable, but the father isn't obligated to comply unless legally required. The question is about being in the wrong, not just legal but also moral. Since the father is following the court order and the time is set by law, he's justified in not giving up his time.\n"
