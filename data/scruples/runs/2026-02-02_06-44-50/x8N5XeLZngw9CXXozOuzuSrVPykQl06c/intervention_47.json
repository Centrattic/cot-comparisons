I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a parent who has a court-ordered visitation schedule with their son every weekend. The other parent is asking to switch every second weekend to have more time with the child because she's in school and it's hard for her. The author is asking if they're the asshole for not wanting to give up their time.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the legal aspect here. The court order is a binding legal document. Unless modified by the court, both parents are supposed to follow it. So if the other parent is requesting a change, the proper way would be through the court system, not just an informal agreement. The author has a right to their scheduled time until the court changes it. \n\nThen there's the emotional side. The author is clearly attached to their son and values the time they have. The other parent is in school, which might be a legitimate reason for needing more time, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is wrong to hold onto their court-ordered time. It's possible the other parent could seek a formal modification if she feels the current arrangement isn't working. \n\nThe key points here are the existence of a court order and whether the author is willing to negotiate outside of legal channels. Since the court order is in place, the author isn't in the wrong for not agreeing to an informal change. The other parent should go through the proper legal process to modify the schedule. \n\nSo, considering the legal standing and the fact that the court order is in place, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
