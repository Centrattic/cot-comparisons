I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a parent who has court-ordered visitation every weekend for their son, and the other parent is asking to take every second weekend because she's in school and feels she doesn't have enough time. The author is resisting giving up any of their time.\n\nFirst, the court order is a legal agreement. If the other parent wants to modify the arrangement, she should go through the legal process. The author isn't in the wrong for not agreeing to a verbal change without a court modification. The original custody decision was made by a court, so any changes should require a court order too. The author's time is protected by the existing order. \n\nThe other parent's argument about being in school might be a reason for her to seek a formal modification, but the author isn't obligated to negotiate outside of the court's decision. The author has the right to maintain their scheduled time unless the court changes it. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
