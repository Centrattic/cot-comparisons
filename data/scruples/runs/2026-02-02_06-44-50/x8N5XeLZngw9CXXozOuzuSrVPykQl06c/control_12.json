I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong when refusing to give up every second weekend with their son. The situation is that the parents are separated, and there's a court order for the father to have the child every weekend. The mother is asking for every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to manage time, even though she already has the child 22 days out of 30, while the father has 8 days.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The father has a court order, which is a legal document outlining custody and visitation. The mother is asking for a change in the schedule, but the father isn't legally required to agree unless both parties come to an agreement or a court modifies the order. So legally, the father isn't in the wrong here because he's following the court's current ruling.\n\nNext, the emotional and practical aspects. The father values his time with the child, looking forward to the weekends and having fun. The mother's argument is that she's in school and it's hard for her. But she already has the majority of the time. The question is whether it's fair for the father to not want to give up his time. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the mother already has 22 days, which is more than two-thirds of the month. The father's 8 days are significantly less. If the mother is struggling with her time, maybe the solution could be to adjust other parts of her schedule or see if they can find a middle ground. However, the father is under no obligation to give up his time, especially if it's part of a court order. Courts typically consider the child's best interest, which includes maintaining a relationship with both parents. If the mother is in school, maybe the father could offer to help with childcare during the school week, but that's not mentioned here.\n\nThe father's feelings about not wanting to lose time are valid. Parents usually want as much time as possible with their children. The mother's request seems to be increasing her own time, which is understandable, but the father's time is already limited. The court order might not be in the child's best interest if the mother's schedule is causing strain, but without a court modification, the father isn't obligated to change it unilaterally.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. The court order is in place, and the father is adhering to it. The mother's request is her responsibility to address through legal channels if needed, not the father's obligation. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
