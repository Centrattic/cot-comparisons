I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent who has a court-ordered visitation with their son every weekend. The other parent (the baby mother) is asking for every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the kid. The author is resisting giving up their time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The author has a court order, which is a legal document. If the other parent is asking for a change, she should go through the legal system to modify the order. The author isn't obligated to agree to changes outside of court. So legally, the author isn't in the wrong because the court order is in place.\n\nEmotionally and ethically, the author is a parent who's been separated for three years. They have limited time with their child, which is already 8 days a month. The other parent has the child 22 days. The author is concerned about losing even more time. It's natural for a parent to want to spend time with their child. The other parent's situation (being in school) might be a valid reason, but the author isn't responsible for solving her scheduling issues. The court order is the agreed-upon schedule, so the author isn't wrong to hold their ground.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author should be more flexible. But the court order is there for a reason, and changing it unilaterally isn't appropriate. The mother should seek a legal modification if she wants changes. The author isn't the one initiating the request, so they aren't in the wrong for not complying with an informal request that could affect their legal rights.\n\nSo the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
