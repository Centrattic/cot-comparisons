I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation is that the author is a parent who has been separated from the baby's mother for three years. They have a court-ordered custody arrangement where they get the child every weekend. The baby mother (probably the ex) is asking the author to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The author is reluctant to lose any time, as they look forward to each weekend and have a good bond with their son. The question is, is the author the asshole for not wanting to give up their time?\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since there's a court order, the custody schedule is legally mandated. The ex can't just unilaterally change it without going through the legal process. So the author isn't in the wrong legally by following the court order. The ex is asking something that's outside the current court arrangement, which the author isn't obligated to do. Legally, the author is in the right here.\n\nNext, the emotional and practical considerations. The author has limited time with their child (8 out of 30 days), which is already a small fraction. They value that time and have a good relationship. The ex is in school and claims it's hard to spend time with the child. However, the ex already has the child 22 days a month. Even if she's busy with school, 22 days seems like a lot. Maybe she's overestimating her difficulties, or perhaps she's using the school as an excuse. The author's time is precious, and the ex is asking to reduce it further without a clear, compelling reason.\n\nAlso, the author's feelings are important. They look forward to the weekends, and the child seems to enjoy them. Cutting that time could affect their relationship and the child's well-being. Parents have a right to bond with their children, and the court order is meant to ensure that. The ex's request, if not based on a legitimate need, might not be fair. The author isn't being unreasonable by holding onto their scheduled time, especially since it's already more than the standard 50/50 split but still a minority of the days.\n\nWait, the standard custody after separation usually allows for some time for the non-custodial parent. 8 days a month is about 26% of the time, which might be standard in some cases. But the ex is asking to reduce that further by 50% (every second weekend). That's a significant cut. The author's resistance is understandable. If the ex is in school, maybe she can adjust her schedule rather than taking the author's time. The author isn't the one with a new constraint; the ex is. The author is just maintaining the current arrangement.\n\nAnother angle: the ex's claim of not enough time. If the child is with her 22 days, that's over two weeks. Unless there are specific issues like the child being in a different time zone or something, that's already a substantial amount. The author's time is less, but it's scheduled for every weekend. The ex's problem might be how she's using those 22 days, but the author isn't responsible for that. The author's role is to have their own time, which is protected by the court order.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The ex is asking for a change without a valid reason, and the author is justified in wanting to keep their court-ordered time. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
