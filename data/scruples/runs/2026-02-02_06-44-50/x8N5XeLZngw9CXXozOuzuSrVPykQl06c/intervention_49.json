I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation is about a parent (the author) who has a court-ordered visitation schedule with their son every weekend. The other parent, the baby mother, is asking for every second weekend to spend time with the child because she's in school and finds it hard to manage time. The author is resisting because they already get 8 days a month and don't want to lose any time. The question is whether the author is the asshole for not giving up their scheduled time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the court order. If there's a legal agreement in place that sets the visitation terms, then both parents are supposed to follow it. The baby mother is requesting a change, but the author isn't obligated to comply unless the court modifies the order. The author isn't violating any laws or agreements by sticking to their current schedule.\n\nNext, the time split: 22 days vs. 8 days. That's a significant difference. The mother has the child most of the time, which might mean the author's time is already limited. The mother's reason is that she's in school, but if she's the primary custodian, her schedule being busy doesn't necessarily justify taking more time. The author's desire to maintain their current time is understandable, especially since they look forward to it and value the time they have.\n\nHowever, maybe there's a middle ground. The author could consider negotiating or finding compromises that don't involve giving up entire weekends. For example, adjusting specific days or times to accommodate the mother's school schedule without reducing their own time. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up any time, not about possible compromises.\n\nAlso, the mother's request is a new one. The author might be right to question why she didn't address this earlier or through the legal system if she's struggling. The court order was established when they were separated, so if her circumstances have changed, she might need to petition the court for modifications rather than directly asking the other parent.\n\nFrom a parental responsibility standpoint, both parents should aim to provide the child with the best possible environment, but the author isn't obligated to sacrifice their own time unless it's in the child's best interest as determined by the court. The author's stance here is about maintaining their own relationship with the child, which is valid.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. They have a legal right to their scheduled time, and the mother's request doesn't seem to be based on any legal grounds unless she goes through the proper channels. The answer should be B.\n"
