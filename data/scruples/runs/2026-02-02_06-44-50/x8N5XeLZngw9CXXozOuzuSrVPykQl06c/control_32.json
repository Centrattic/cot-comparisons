I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not wanting to give up some of their scheduled time with their son. The context is that they have a court order for every weekend, and the baby's mother is requesting every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard. The author feels they already have 8 days a month, which is less than the mother's 22, and they don't want to lose any time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so that's a binding agreement. Without a modification from the court, the author isn't legally obligated to change their time unless both parties agree. The mother's request isn't a court-mandated change, so the author isn't violating any laws by sticking to the current arrangement.\n\nEmotionally, the author is clearly attached to their son and values the time they have. They mention looking forward to the weekends and having fun, which shows they're invested in being a present parent. The mother, on the other hand, is in a challenging situation with school, which might be affecting her ability to care for the child as much as she'd like. However, her current schedule already gives her the majority of the time (22 days), so the author's 8 days are already a minority. \n\nI should also think about the fairness of the request. If the mother is in school and needs more time, maybe she's struggling with balancing studies and parenting. But the author's time is fixed by the court, and the mother's asking for something that's already part of the court order. The court might have considered that the mother needs the majority of the time for other reasons, like the child's stability or her own responsibilities. \n\nAnother angle is the child's best interest. The court typically aims for what's best for the child. If the current arrangement is what the court decided, it's likely based on that principle. The author's time is consistent and every weekend, which could be beneficial for the child's routine. The mother's request might disrupt that if the author's time is reduced without court approval. \n\nThe mother might feel she needs more time, but the author isn't the one who set the original terms. They're following the law, so they can't just give up their time without legal changes. The mother should perhaps go through the proper legal channels to request a modification if she's facing difficulties. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they're adhering to the court order. The mother's request, while understandable, isn't something the author can unilaterally agree to without legal process. The answer should be B (No).\n"
