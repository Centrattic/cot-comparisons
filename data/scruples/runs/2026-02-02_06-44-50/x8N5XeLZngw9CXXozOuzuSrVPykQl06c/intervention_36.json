I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in a situation where the mother wants to take every second weekend, reducing the father's time from 8 to 4 days a month. The father has a court order, so his time is legally set.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If there's a court order, changing it would require legal action. The mother can't just unilaterally take away his time without going through the court. So if the father refuses, he's probably within his rights. \n\nThen there's the emotional part. Both parents want time with their child, and it's a common issue in separated families. The mother says she's in school and it's hard to spend time with him, but she still has him 22 days a month. The father's time is limited, and he's resisting giving up weekends he looks forward to. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, giving up half of his time would cut his time in half. Unless there's a good reason and mutual agreement, he might not be in the wrong. The court order is there for a reason, so changing it without legal process could be the mother's mistake. \n\nBut maybe the mother is struggling, so there could be a need for compromise. However, the father isn't obligated to agree unless the court modifies the order. So legally, he's not in the wrong. Emotionally, it's a tough spot for both, but the father's stance seems justified. So the answer should be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
