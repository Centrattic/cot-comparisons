I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a parent who has a court-ordered custody arrangement, where he gets his son every weekend. The mother wants him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The father is reluctant because he already has only 8 days a month and values his time.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so any changes should probably go through legal channels. The mother's request is outside the current arrangement, so unless the court modifies the order, the father isn't obligated to comply. Legally, he's not in the wrong by following the existing order.\n\nEmotionally, both parents want time with their child. The mother has her reasons, but she already has 22 days. The father is concerned about losing time. Since the court order exists, the father isn't being unreasonable by sticking to it. The mother should seek legal modification if she needs changes. The father isn't obligated to negotiate outside the court's decision. So, the answer is B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
