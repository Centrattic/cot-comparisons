I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent who has a court-ordered visitation schedule every weekend. The other parent is asking for every second weekend to herself because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with their son. The original poster is reluctant to give up any of their time since they only get 8 days a month.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, which means the current arrangement is legally binding. The other parent is suggesting a change, but the original parent is against it. Legally, changing a court order usually requires some process, maybe going back to court. So the parent not wanting to give up time without legal changes might be justified.\n\nNext, the division of time. The mother has the child 22 days a month, and the father has 8. That's a significant difference. The mother is the custodial parent, which is common in many cases, especially if the parents are separated. The father's time is already limited, so asking him to give up more might be unfair. The mother's reasoning is that she's in school and can't spend time with him, but she's still the one with the majority of the time. Maybe she could adjust her schedule during the other days or weeks instead of taking more from the father.\n\nEmotionally, both parents want time with their child. The father looks forward to every weekend and they have fun. It's natural for any parent to want to maximize their time. The mother's request might be coming from a place of wanting more connection, but the father's time is already limited. The mother could explore other ways to be with her child during the 22 days she has him, maybe rearranging her study schedule or finding shorter periods to spend together without encroaching on the father's time.\n\nAlso, considering the child's well-being, maintaining a consistent relationship with both parents is important. If the father gives up his days, he might lose that crucial bond. The mother's solution might not be the best approach. It's possible the mother is feeling overwhelmed with school, but she's the one who already has the majority of the time. The father's refusal might be justified to protect his scheduled time.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the mother is the one with the primary custody and more days, so perhaps the father is correct in not wanting to give up any time. The mother should perhaps seek alternative solutions, like using her existing days more effectively or negotiating in a way that doesn't cut into the father's court-ordered time without legal changes. So, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
