I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about custody time with their son. They have a court order for every weekend, which is about 8 days a month. The baby mother wants every second weekend, so she can have the kid 22 days a month. The writer is reluctant to give up their time.\n\nFirst, I need to check the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so legally, the mother can't just change it without the court's approval. The writer is within their legal rights to not agree to the change. So legally, they aren't in the wrong.\n\nNext, the ethical or moral aspect. The writer mentions they look forward to every weekend and have fun with their son. The mother is in school, so maybe her schedule is tough, but the current arrangement gives her 22 days. If the writer is already complying with the court order, is it fair to give up more time? The mother is the primary caregiver, so 22 days might be more, but the writer's time is precious. It's a balance between the child's best interest and the parents' schedules. The writer isn't being selfish if the court order is valid and they're maintaining their time. So morally, they aren't in the wrong either.\n\nPossible counterarguments: The mother might feel she needs more time because of her school commitments. But the court order was set for the child's best interest initially. Without a court modification, the writer isn't obligated to change it. Maybe the mother should approach the court if she needs adjustments, but the writer isn't at fault for not giving up time without legal changes.\n\nConclusion: The author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
