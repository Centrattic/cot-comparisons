I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to give up their weekend time with their son to the baby's mother.\n\nFirst, the background: The person has a court order for every weekend with their son. The baby's mother wants every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to balance. She currently has the child 22 days a month, and the father has 8 days. The question is whether the father is wrong for not giving up some time.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the court order is in place. If the mother wants to change the arrangement, she would need to go through the court to modify the custody order. The father isn't legally obligated to agree without the court's approval. So legally, he's not in the wrong because the current order is the law right now.\n\nEmotionally, both parents probably want to spend time with their child. The mother's argument is about her being in school and the difficulty of time management. However, the father's time is already limited, and he's using the time he has. The user points out that the mother has significantly more time with the child each month, so the father's reluctance is understandable. \n\nThe key here is that the court order exists for a reason, and any changes should be handled through legal channels, not informal agreements. The father isn't being unreasonable by sticking to the current arrangement. The mother's request might be valid, but it's not something the father is required to accept without a court modification. Therefore, the father isn't the asshole here because he's following the law and protecting his scheduled time with his child.\n"
