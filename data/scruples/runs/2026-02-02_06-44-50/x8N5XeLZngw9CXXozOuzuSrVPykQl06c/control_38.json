I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author is a separated parent who has a court-ordered visitation every weekend. The ex-partner, the baby's mother, is asking him to give up every second weekend because she says she doesn't get enough time with the child. The author is resisting because he feels he already has limited time (8 out of 30 days) and doesn't want to lose more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since there's a court order in place, the author is legally entitled to his visitation time. The mother can't unilaterally change that without going through legal channels. So the author is within his rights to not agree to the request. Legally, he's not in the wrong.\n\nEmotionally, the author is attached to his son and values the time they spend together. It's natural for a parent to want to maximize time with their child. The mother is in school, which might affect her ability to spend time, but the author's time is also precious to him.\n\nThe mother having the child 22 days a week might seem like a lot, but the court order might have been structured that way for a reason. Maybe the author is the non-custodial parent, which typically means the other parent has primary custody. However, unless the court decides otherwise, the custodial parent can have more days. Still, the non-custodial parent's time is protected.\n\nThe key here is the court order. If the mother wants to change the arrangement, she needs to go through the legal system. The author isn't obligated to agree without a court modification. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author is justified in wanting to maintain his court-ordered time, especially since the request isn't legally binding. The mother's request is personal and doesn't override the existing legal agreement. The author isn't being selfish; he's upholding his rights as per the court's decision.\n"
