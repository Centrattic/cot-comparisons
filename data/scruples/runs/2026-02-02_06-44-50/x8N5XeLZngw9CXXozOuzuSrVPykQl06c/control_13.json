I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the situation is the asshole (ITA) for not wanting to give up their weekend time with their son. The parent has a court order for every weekend, and the other parent wants every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The user is wondering if they're wrong for not giving up their time.\n\nFirst, the court order is a legal agreement. The parent is following the court's decision, which is about ensuring both parents have time with the child. The other parent is asking for a change, possibly without court approval. The user's side is that the other parent already has 22 days, so 8 days is their current arrangement. They feel the request is unfair, especially since they look forward to the weekends and have a bond with the child.\n\nThe key points here are the existing legal agreement and the other parent's request. Since the court order is in place, the parent isn't obligated to give up their time unless there's a legal change. The other parent's situation (being in school) might be a reason to ask, but the decision ultimately rests with the court. The parent's emotional attachment and the effort to maintain their relationship with the child are valid. \n\nThe question is whether the parent is in the wrong for not complying. If the court order is still valid, then the parent isn't in the wrong. The other parent needs to negotiate through legal channels, not unilaterally decide. So the answer would be B (Not the asshole). The parent is standing by their legal rights and the bond they've built with their child, which is understandable.\n"
