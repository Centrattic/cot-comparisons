I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a parent who has a court-ordered custody arrangement where they get their son every weekend. The other parent is asking them to give up every second weekend, claiming she doesn't have enough time because she's in school. The author is reluctant to give up any of their time.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspect here. The author has a court order in place that outlines their visitation rights. Court orders are legally binding, so any changes would typically require a modification by the court. The other parent can't unilaterally alter the custody arrangement; they would need to go through the legal system to request a change. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I should consider the facts. The author's time is set by the court, and the other parent is asking for a change without following the proper legal process. The author's resistance isn't just about being selfish; it's about protecting their legally established time with their child. \n\nThe other parent has the child 22 days a month, which is more than the author's 8 days. The author's concern is valid because their time is limited and scheduled. The other parent's reason (being in school) might be a factor, but the court order is already in place. If the other parent's schedule is causing issues, she should seek a legal adjustment, not ask the other parent to comply without court approval.\n\nAlso, emotional aspects matter. The author looks forward to every weekend, which is crucial for their relationship with the child. Giving up even some weekends could impact their bond. The court likely structured the visits to ensure both parents can maintain a relationship with the child, so reducing the author's time without court approval might be detrimental.\n\nSo, the key points are: existing court order, legal process needed for changes, the other parent not following protocol, and the author protecting their time. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B (No)."
