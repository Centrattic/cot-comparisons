I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent who has a court-ordered custody arrangement where they get their son every weekend. The mother wants him every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with him. The author is reluctant to give up any of their scheduled time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the court order. If there's a legal agreement in place, that's usually the binding factor. The author's time is set by the court, so unless there's a modification, they aren't obligated to give it up. The mother's request is outside the current arrangement, so the author isn't legally required to comply. \n\nNext, the numbers: the mother has the child 22 days a month, which is about 73% of the time, while the father has him 8 days. That's already a significant majority for the mother. The father is concerned about losing even more time. Even if the mother is in school, she still has the majority of the time. The father's time is limited, and he's using it to bond with his son. \n\nEmotionally, the father looks forward to the weekends and values that time. The mother's situation (school) might be challenging, but she's already the primary caregiver. The father isn't being unreasonable by not wanting to reduce his time, especially since the court order is in place. \n\nPossible angles: Maybe the mother is trying to adjust for her own schedule, but the father isn't required to adjust unless both parties agree or the court modifies the order. The father's attachment and the child's relationship with both parents are important. However, the legal aspect is key here. Without a court modification, the father isn't in the wrong for not giving up his scheduled time. \n\nAlso, the mother approaching at drop-off might be a point of contention. Maybe she's trying to negotiate outside the court order, which could be a red flag. The father isn't obligated to negotiate beyond the legal terms. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The father is following the court order and has a right to his scheduled time. The mother's request isn't legally binding unless modified, and the father is within his rights to maintain his current arrangement.\n"
