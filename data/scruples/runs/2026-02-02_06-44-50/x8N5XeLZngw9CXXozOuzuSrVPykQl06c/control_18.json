I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for not wanting to give up every second weekend with their son. The parent has a court order for every weekend, which is 8 days a month, while the other parent has 22 days. The mother wants the noncustodial parent to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so changing it would require going back to court. The noncustodial parent shouldn't unilaterally alter the agreement without legal approval. But the user is asking about being in the wrong morally, not legally. \n\nThen, the mother's reasoning is that she's in school and has difficulty finding time. However, the custody arrangement is already 22 days to 8, which is a significant majority. Maybe she's not using the time effectively or there are other factors. The noncustodial parent is concerned about losing time, which they look forward to, and they have a strong bond with the child. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the custody split is already uneven. If the mother is struggling with her time, perhaps she could adjust her own schedule instead of taking more from the other parent. The noncustodial parent's time is limited, so giving up more without a court order might not be right. \n\nBut I should also consider if there's a misunderstanding. Maybe the mother's school schedule is causing issues that aren't addressed in the current order, like weekday time being too fragmented. However, the user hasn't mentioned the current arrangement's specifics beyond weekends. The court order is likely based on the child's best interest, so the noncustodial parent isn't necessarily wrong for following it. \n\nAlso, communication is key. The mother approached during drop-off, which might be a stressful time. The noncustodial parent could express their concerns and maybe discuss adjustments that don't require giving up entire weekends. But the question is about the morality of not wanting to give up time, not about communication. \n\nSo, the parent is not in the wrong for valuing their time with the son as per the court order. The mother is seeking more time, but the existing arrangement is already in her favor. The answer is B.\n"
