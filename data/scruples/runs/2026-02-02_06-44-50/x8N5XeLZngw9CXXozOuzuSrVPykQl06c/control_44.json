I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about custody time. The parent, let's call them Parent A, has a court order for every weekend with their son, while the other parent, the ex, has the child 22 days a month. The ex is asking for every second weekend to have the child because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with him. Parent A doesn't want to give up any of their time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, which means the current arrangement is legally binding. The ex is asking for a change, but Parent A isn't obligated to agree unless the court modifies the order. So legally, Parent A isn't in the wrong because they have the court's ruling.\n\nEmotionally, the parent is attached to their time with the child. The ex has the child most days, so maybe the ex feels she can't have quality time during the week. But Parent A's time is significant as it's the weekends they see their son. The child having 22 days with the mother and 8 with the father\u2014maybe the split is already 70-30? But the court order is set for every weekend, so that's the arrangement unless changed.\n\nIs the father being unreasonable? Well, the ex's request is to have every second weekend, which would reduce Parent A's time from 8 to 4 days a month. That's a big cut. The ex is in school, but she's still the one with the child most days. Maybe she could adjust her schedule to have time during the week. But Parent A is not required to give up their court-ordered time unless there's a legal modification. So Parent A isn't in the wrong. The ex should go through the legal process to request a change, not ask Parent A to agree. So the answer is B.\n"
