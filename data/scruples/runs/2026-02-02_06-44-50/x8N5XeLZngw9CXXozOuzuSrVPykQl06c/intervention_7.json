I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about custody time with their son. The author has a court-ordered arrangement where they get every weekend, totaling 8 days a month, while the mother has 22 days. The mother wants every second weekend, so maybe that would reduce the author's time by 50% or so. The author is resisting because they really value their time with the kid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so unless the mother goes through the legal process to modify it, the author isn't obligated to agree. The mother is asking outside of the court, so the author isn't wrong for not complying. Legally, the author has the right to their time as per the order.\n\nEmotionally and ethically, it's more complex. The mother is in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. But the existing split is already 22 vs. 8 days. The author is concerned about losing even more time. The question is whether it's fair to reduce the father's time without a court modification. The author isn't being unreasonable by holding onto the court-ordered time. The mother should ideally seek a legal adjustment if she wants a change. \n\nSo the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
