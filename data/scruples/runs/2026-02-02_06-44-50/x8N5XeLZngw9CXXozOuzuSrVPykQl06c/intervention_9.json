I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent who has a court-ordered visitation schedule with their son. The mother wants the father to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The father is resisting and wondering if he's being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The father has a court order that outlines his visitation rights. Court orders are legally binding, so any changes to them would typically require a modification through the court system. The mother can't just unilaterally ask for a change without going through the proper legal channels. That's a key point. If the court order is in place, the father isn't obligated to give up his time unless the court decides otherwise.\n\nThen there's the emotional side. Both parents love their child, but they're trying to balance their own lives. The mother is in school, which is a valid reason for her to feel like she's struggling with time. However, the father's time is also precious. The question is whether the father is being unreasonable by not wanting to give up his weekends. \n\nThe mother has the child 22 days a month, which is the majority. The father has 8 days. The mother's request is to take every second weekend, which would reduce the father's time further. That could be significant. It's important to note that custody and visitation arrangements are often decided based on the child's best interests. The court might consider factors like each parent's ability to care for the child, stability, and the child's needs.\n\nBut in this case, the father is not the one seeking a change; the mother is. Since the court order exists, the father isn't in the wrong for not agreeing to an informal change. The proper way for the mother to request a modification is through the court. If she hasn't done that, the father isn't obligated to comply. \n\nHowever, maybe the mother's situation is genuine. If she's in school and struggling, maybe there's a way to adjust the schedule with the court's approval. The father's resistance could be seen as not being cooperative, but legally, he's within his rights. The user initially thought the author (father) is in the wrong, but maybe that's not the case. \n\nSo the key here is that the father isn't at fault for not giving up his court-ordered time. The mother should seek a legal modification if she wants changes. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
