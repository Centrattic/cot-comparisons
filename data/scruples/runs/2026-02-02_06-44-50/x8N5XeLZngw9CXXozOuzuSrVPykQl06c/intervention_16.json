I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent who has a court order for every weekend with their son, and the other parent is asking for every second weekend because she's in school. The author feels they don't want to give up their time and is wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so the author's time is legally protected. The other parent can't just unilaterally change the custody arrangement unless they go through the legal process. So if the author is following the court order, they're not in the wrong legally.\n\nEmotionally, the author is clearly attached to their son and values the time they get. It's natural for a parent to want to spend time with their child, especially since they've had the weekends for three years. The other parent's request might be due to her current circumstances (school), but the existing arrangement already gives her 22 days a month. That's actually more than the author's 8 days. So maybe the other parent is overstepping by asking for more time without a legal change.\n\nHowever, the other parent's reasoning is that she's busy with school. But the current court order might already be structured to account for such situations. If the court order hasn't been modified, the author isn't obligated to give up their scheduled time. The other parent should consult a lawyer to request a formal modification if her situation has changed significantly.\n\nAlso, the author isn't being selfish if they're adhering to the legal agreement. Parents often have to work out schedules, but once a court order is in place, it's a binding agreement. So the author's stance is justified unless there's a valid reason to alter the order, which the other parent hasn't provided yet.\n\nI should check if there are any factors like the child's best interest or recent changes in the other parent's life that could warrant a modification. The user mentioned the other parent is in school, but that's a general reason. Without more specific details showing that the current arrangement is causing harm or that the court order is outdated, the author has a right to maintain their time.\n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they are upholding their legal rights, and the other parent should seek legal means to adjust the custody if necessary, not just ask the other parent to comply without it.\n"
