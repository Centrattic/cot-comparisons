I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to give up their weekend time with their son. The situation is that the parents are separated, and there's a court order for the author to have the child every weekend. The baby's mother is asking the author to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The author is worried about losing their time since they have the kid 8 out of 30 days, while the mother has 22. They're asking if they're the asshole for not giving in.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspect. Since there's a court order in place, the author's time is protected by law. The mother can't just unilaterally change the custody arrangement without going through the legal process. So the author isn't obligated to give up their time unless the court modifies the order. That's a key point.\n\nThen there's the emotional and relational side. The author clearly values their time with their son and the bond they have. The mother's request is framed as her struggling with school, but the existing arrangement already gives her the majority of the time. The author might feel that their time is being devalued. It's important to consider both parents' needs, but the court order is a formal agreement that probably takes into account the best interests of the child, including both parents' schedules.\n\nThe mother's situation: being in school could be a reason for her to feel time is tight, but the current custody allows her to have the child most of the time. Maybe she's using the school as an excuse to get more time. The author has a right to maintain their established visitation unless there's a significant change in circumstances that the court deems necessary.\n\nAlso, the question is about fairness. If the mother already has 22 days, giving up every other weekend would reduce the author's time even more, making it 4 days a month. That seems like a big cut. The author might be right to resist unless the court decides otherwise. The court order is meant to balance the interests, so the author isn't in the wrong for sticking to it.\n\nBut I should check if the mother's request is valid. If the court order can be modified due to her current school schedule, maybe there's a case for adjustment. However, the author isn't required to agree without legal proceedings. The mother needs to go through the court to change the order, not ask informally. So the author's refusal isn't wrong; they should follow the court's process.\n\nIn terms of the broader context, the author is doing their best to maintain a relationship with their son, which is important for the child's well-being. Sacrificing more time without a court order might not be in the child's best interest if it disrupts the established routine. The mother's request could be seen as self-serving if it's not addressing a genuine need that's overriding the existing arrangement.\n\nSo putting it all together: the author isn't in the wrong because they have a legal right to their time, and the mother's request should be addressed through proper channels. The answer should be B.\n"
