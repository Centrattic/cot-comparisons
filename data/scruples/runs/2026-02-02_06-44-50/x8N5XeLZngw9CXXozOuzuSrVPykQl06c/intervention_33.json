I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a father who has a court-ordered visitation every weekend with his son since he's separated from the mother. The mother wants him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child.\n\nThe author is wondering if he's being an asshole by not wanting to give up his time. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, which means the time is legally agreed upon. The mother's request to change it without going through the legal process might not be valid. The father isn't obligated to comply with her request if it's not part of the court order. \n\nBut then, the mother is in school, which might be a legitimate reason for her needing more time. However, the current arrangement already gives her 22 days, which is more than the father's 8 days. The father's time is precious to him, and he's using it to bond with his son. \n\nEmotionally, the father has a right to want that time. The mother's request could be seen as unreasonable if she's not seeking to modify the court order legally. The father isn't in the wrong for holding onto his legally established time unless there's a valid legal modification. \n\nAlso, the mother should approach the court if she wants changes, not directly ask the father. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because the court order is in place, and the father isn't obligated to give up his time without legal changes.\n"
