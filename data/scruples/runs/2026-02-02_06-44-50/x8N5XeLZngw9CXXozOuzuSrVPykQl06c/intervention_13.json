I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not wanting to give up some of their time with their son. The situation is that they're separated from the baby's mother, have a court order for every weekend, and she's asking for every second weekend because she's in school.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the court order. If it's a legal arrangement, then the author is supposed to follow that unless there's a court modification. The mother is requesting a change, but the author is resisting. The key points here are the existing legal agreement and the reason given by the mother.\n\nThe mother says she's in school, which makes it hard to find time. But the author points out that she already has the child 22 out of 30 days. So maybe she's asking for even more time when she's already the primary caregiver. The author's weekends are their time, and giving up every second one would reduce their time from 8 to 4 days a month. That seems like a significant cut, especially if the court order was established after considering both parents' situations.\n\nAlso, the father is separated, so maybe the custody arrangement is already structured to balance their time. The mother's request could be seen as trying to take more time, possibly at the father's expense. However, the mother might be facing real challenges with school, so her request has a valid reason. But the court order is in place, so changing it without legal process might not be appropriate. \n\nThe father's perspective is that he looks forward to the weekends and they have fun. That suggests the time is important to him and the child. Without knowing the specifics of the court order's terms, like if it's visitation rights or custody, it's a bit tricky. If it's a formal custody arrangement, the mother can't just unilaterally take the child without the father's consent or a court order change.\n\nSo the father not wanting to give up his time without a court modification might be justified. The mother should probably go through the legal system to request a change, not just ask him to agree. The author isn't in the wrong for holding onto their court-ordered time. The answer would be B, No.\n"
