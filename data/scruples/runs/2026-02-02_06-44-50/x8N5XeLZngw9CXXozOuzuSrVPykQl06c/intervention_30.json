I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent who has a court-ordered custody arrangement where they get the child every weekend. The other parent (the baby mother) is asking for every second weekend to themselves because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The AITA is reluctant to give up any time. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants to know the opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so any changes would need to be discussed and possibly modified through legal channels. The current arrangement gives the other parent 22 days and the AITA 8 days a month. The parent is in school, which might make scheduling difficult, but the existing order is set by the court, so the AITA isn't obligated to give up time unless the court modifies it.\n\nFrom an emotional standpoint, both parents want time with their child. The AITA is attaching significant value to their time, which is understandable since it's limited. The other parent's situation with school might be a legitimate challenge, but the AITA is not required to adjust the schedule unless agreed upon or ordered by the court. \n\nThe key points here are: the court order's enforceability, the balance between both parents' needs, and whether the AITA is being reasonable. The author isn't in the wrong because the court order is the deciding factor. The other parent should seek legal modification if they feel the current arrangement is unfair. The AITA isn't obligated to negotiate beyond the court's decision. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
