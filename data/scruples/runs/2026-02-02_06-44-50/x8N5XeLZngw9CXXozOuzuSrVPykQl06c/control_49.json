I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the situation is the asshole for not wanting to give up some of their time with their son. The background is that the parent has a court-ordered custody arrangement, seeing their son every weekend, which is 8 days a month. The other parent, the baby mother, is asking for every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. She currently has 22 days a month.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so any changes should probably go through legal channels. The parent in question isn't obligated to give up time unless the court modifies the order. So legally, they might not be in the wrong. \n\nEmotionally, both parents want time with their child. The mother is in school, which might be a legitimate reason for her to feel she's missing out. But the father is also attached to his weekends. The key here is that the current arrangement is 22 vs. 8 days. The father is being asked to reduce his time further, which could be seen as unfair, especially if the court order was already structured to balance their time. \n\nThe father's response is about not wanting to lose any time, which is natural for a parent. The mother's request might be reasonable, but the father isn't the asshole for not agreeing. The proper way for her to handle this is through the court system, not directly asking him. So the father isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
