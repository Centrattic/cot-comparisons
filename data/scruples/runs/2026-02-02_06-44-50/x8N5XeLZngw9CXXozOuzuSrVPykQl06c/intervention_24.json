I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a parent who has a court order for weekend visits with their son, and the other parent is asking for every second weekend, arguing that she's in school and finds it hard to spend time. The author is reluctant to give up their time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so any changes should ideally go through legal channels. The mother is asking for a modification, but the father might be within his rights to maintain the existing schedule unless the court adjusts it. \n\nNext, the time split: 22 days to 8 days a month. That's a significant difference. The mother already has more time, so the father might feel his time is minimal. The mother's reasoning is she's in school, but that's probably a personal circumstance. However, the father's right to his scheduled time is protected by the court. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, both parents might have valid reasons. The mother might be struggling with her schedule, but the father's time is important for bonding. The key is whether the father is unreasonably refusing to adjust. Since the court order is in place, he isn't in the wrong for sticking to it unless there's a legal change. The mother should approach the court for modifications, not the other parent directly. \n\nThe father's response was to question the request, which is reasonable. He isn't obligated to give up his time without legal changes. So, the answer is B. The father isn't in the wrong.\n"
