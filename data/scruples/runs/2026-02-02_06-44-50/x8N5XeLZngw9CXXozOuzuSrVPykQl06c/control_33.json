I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a father who has a court-ordered custody arrangement where he sees his son every weekend. The mother wants him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and says she doesn't get enough time with the child. The father is reluctant because he only gets 8 days a month and doesn't want to lose any time.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the father is in the wrong for not wanting to adjust his custody time. The key points here are the existing court order, the current custody schedule, and the mother's request. The court order is legally binding, so any changes would require mutual agreement or a court modification. The father's current arrangement gives him 8 days a month, which is already less than the mother's 22 days. The mother is in school, which might be a valid reason for her time constraints, but the father's time is precious to him. \n\nLegally, the father isn't obligated to give up his court-ordered time without a formal change. Emotionally, both parents likely want quality time with their child. The father's refusal isn't about spite but about valuing his limited time. The mother's request might be understandable, but the father isn't wrong for prioritizing his scheduled time. The court order exists for a reason, possibly due to the separation and custody battles. Without legal changes, the father isn't in the wrong for sticking to the agreed-upon schedule. So the answer is B.\n"
