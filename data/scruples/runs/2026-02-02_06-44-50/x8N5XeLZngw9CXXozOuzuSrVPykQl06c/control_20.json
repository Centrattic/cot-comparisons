I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a parent who has a court-ordered visitation schedule, every weekend, and the other parent wants to take every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the kid. The author is saying they don't want to give up their time because they only get 8 days a month versus the other parent's 22 days.\n\nFirst, the court order is key here. Since it's a legal agreement, both parents are supposed to follow it unless they can come to a mutual agreement or the court modifies it. The other parent is making a request, but the author isn't obligated to agree without the court's say-so. The mother is in school, so maybe her schedule is busy, but she already has the majority of the time. The author is concerned about losing time they look forward to. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the court order is in place, the author isn't breaking any laws by not giving up their time. The other parent's request is reasonable in intent but the author isn't required to comply without a court modification. So the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
