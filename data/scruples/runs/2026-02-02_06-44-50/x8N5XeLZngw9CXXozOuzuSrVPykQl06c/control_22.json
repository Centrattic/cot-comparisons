I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting to give up their weekend time with their son. The background is they've been separated for three years, with a court order that grants them every weekend. The mother wants every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the kid. The user is upset because they already have the child 8 out of 30 days, while the mother has 22. They don't want to lose any time.\n\nFirst, the court order is a legal agreement. Unless modified by the court, both parents are supposed to follow it. The mother's request to change the schedule isn't something the user has to agree to without going through the legal process. So, the user isn't in the wrong for sticking to the court order. The mother's reasoning might be valid, but changing the custody arrangement requires a court's approval. The user's desire to maintain their scheduled time is reasonable, especially since they have a legal right to it. The answer should be B, No.\n"
