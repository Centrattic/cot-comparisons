I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent who has a court-ordered visitation every weekend with his son, and the other parent is asking him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finding time hard. The author is wondering if they're the asshole for not wanting to give up their time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, which legally defines the visitation rights. The mother is asking the father to voluntarily give up his time, but he's not willing to. Since the order is already set, he's not obligated to give it up unless the court modifies it. So legally, he's probably not in the wrong. \n\nThen there's the emotional and practical side. The father values his time with his son, which is understandable. The mother has 22 days, which is more than half the month, so maybe she's using the school as an excuse. But maybe she's genuinely struggling. However, the father isn't required to give up any time unless the court decides it. The mother would need to request a modification through the legal system, not ask the father to agree. \n\nThe key points here are the existence of a court order and the fact that the parent is asking the father to give up his time voluntarily. Since the father isn't legally required to do so, he's within his rights. The mother might need to go through the proper legal channels if she wants to change the arrangement. \n\nSo, based on that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The father is protecting his legally established time with his son, and the mother should handle the request through the court if she wants changes. The father isn't obligated to agree without a court modification. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but considering the court order and the father's right to his visitation, the answer is B.\n"
