I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about custody time with their son.\n\nFirst, the parent has a court order for every weekend with their son. The other parent (baby mother) is asking to take every second weekend because she's in school and wants more time. The current custody arrangement is 8 days a month for the poster and 22 days for the other parent. The poster is resisting giving up any time.\n\nI need to consider several factors. The court order is in place, so any changes should go through legal channels. The other parent is requesting a modification, but the poster isn't obligated to agree without legal process. The poster's feelings about the time being precious make sense, especially since it's every weekend. The other parent's situation (school) might affect her ability to spend time, but the current split is already 22 vs 8 days, which is a significant disparity. \n\nThe key points are: existing legal agreement, the request to alter it, and the balance of time. The poster isn't in the wrong for not agreeing to give up time without legal proceedings. The other parent needs to seek a court modification, not just an agreement. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
