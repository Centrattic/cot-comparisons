I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a father who has a court-ordered custody arrangement. He's separated from his son's mother, and they have a set schedule where he sees his son every weekend. The mother is asking him to give up every second weekend because she feels she doesn't get enough time with the child. The father feels he already has 8 days a month and doesn't want to lose any of that time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since there's a court order in place, any changes to custody should be made through the legal system. The mother's request is outside of that, so the father isn't obligated to agree without legal modification. The court order is a binding agreement, so the father isn't wrong for not complying without a court's say-so.\n\nThen, the emotional side. The father values his time with his son and looks forward to the weekends. The mother is in school, which might make her time management harder, but that doesn't automatically mean the father should adjust his time. The mother's request is reasonable in terms of wanting more time, but the father's feelings are also valid. It's a matter of balancing both parents' needs and the child's best interests.\n\nHowever, the father isn't in the wrong here because he's following the court order. The mother should approach the court to modify the agreement if she wants changes. The father's refusal to give up time without a legal change isn't a moral failing; it's upholding a legal contract. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
