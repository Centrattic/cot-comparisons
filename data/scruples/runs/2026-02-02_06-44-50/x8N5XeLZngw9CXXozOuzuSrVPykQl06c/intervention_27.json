I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is a parent who has a court-ordered custody arrangement where they get their son every weekend for 8 days a month, and the other parent (the baby mother) has him 22 days. The baby mother is now asking the author to give up every second weekend because she's in school and struggles with time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so unless there's a modification, the author isn't obligated to give up their scheduled time. The baby mother's request is a change in the existing arrangement, which would typically require legal action or mutual agreement. If the author is following the court order, then they aren't legally in the wrong. \n\nNext, the emotional and parental perspective. Both parents want time with their child, which is natural. However, the author's time is already significantly less (8 vs. 22 days). If the baby mother is in school, maybe she's adjusting to a new schedule, but the author's time is fixed by the court. The author might be worried about losing even more time, which could affect their relationship with the child. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is morally in the wrong for not giving up the time. The author's argument is about not wanting to lose any time, especially since they look forward to the weekends. The other parent's request is based on her current challenges. \n\nIf the author refuses, they might be seen as not being cooperative, but they also have a legal right to their time. However, if the other parent is struggling, maybe the author could consider some flexibility, but that's not a requirement. The key here is that the court order is in place, so without a legal change, the author isn't obligated. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they are adhering to the court order and their right to the scheduled time. The baby mother's request would need to go through the legal system to modify the custody arrangement. The author isn't at fault for not agreeing to give up their time without a legal change.\n"
