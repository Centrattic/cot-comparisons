I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person in this situation is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the details again.\n\nThe author is a parent who has been separated from the baby's mother for three years since the son was born. They have a court order that gives them time with their son every weekend. Now, the baby's mother is asking the author to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the kid. The author is resisting because they only get 8 days a month, which is less than the other parent. They feel they can't lose any time since they look forward to it and have fun with their son. The question is whether the author is the asshole for not wanting to give up their time.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspects. There's a court order in place, which typically means the custody arrangement is legally binding. The mother is requesting a change, but the author is not willing to without adjusting the order. Legally, the author is correct not to agree to a change outside the court. Any modifications to custody should go through legal channels to ensure validity and avoid potential conflicts.\n\nNext, the emotional and practical sides. The daughter is in school, which might mean her schedule is busy. However, the current arrangement already gives her 22 days a month, which is more than the other parent. The author is concerned about their limited time and the bond they have with their son. It's natural for parents to want quality time with their children, especially when it's already restricted. The daughter's claim of not enough time might be valid, but the author's time is already significantly less. \n\nI should also think about the child's best interest. Courts usually prioritize the child's well-being, considering both parents' time and relationship. If the current arrangement is working well and the author is providing a positive environment, altering it without legal review could be detrimental. But if the mother is struggling due to school commitments and the arrangement could be adjusted to maintain the child's stability, maybe there's room for negotiation. However, the author isn't obligated to do so unless the court modifies the order. \n\nThere might be a misunderstanding here. The daughter could feel the 22 days aren't enough, but the author's 8 days are a smaller chunk. The key is that the court has already decided the time, and the author is within their rights to maintain it. The other parent might need to petition the court if she wants changes, especially if it's affecting her ability to care for the child. But the author isn't the one making the request; they're defending their existing time. \n\nSo, the author's stance is legally sound. Emotionally, they're protecting their time with their son, which is understandable. The mother's request might be reasonable, but the author isn't in the wrong for not agreeing to it without court involvement. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
