I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation is about a separated parent who has a court order for weekend visits with their son. The other parent wants to take every second weekend, reducing the first parent's time from 8 days a month to maybe 4? The writer is resisting that because they really value their time with the kid and it's all they have. The other parent is in school, which is making it hard to spend time with the child, hence the request.\n\nI need to figure out if the writer is wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate it. Let's consider the legal aspect first. The court order is in place, which means the time arrangement is legally established. The mother is asking for a change without going through the court, which could be an issue. Parents can't unilaterally alter custody agreements without court approval, right? So the writer is not obligated to give up their court-ordered time. \n\nBut then there's the emotional aspect. The other parent is in school and might be struggling to balance responsibilities. However, the current arrangement already gives her 22 days out of 30, which is the majority. The writer's time is already limited. The question is about fairness and the existing legal framework. Since the court order exists, the writer isn't violating anything by not agreeing. The mother should probably petition the court for a modification if her circumstances have changed significantly, but that's a legal process.\n\nSo, the writer is staying within their rights by not giving up time. However, maybe there's more context. The user might be thinking that being a parent is about sharing, but the court's decision is based on what's in the child's best interest. If the current order is fair, the writer isn't wrong. If the mother is facing hardships, maybe the writer could be more understanding. But the core issue is about not giving up court-ordered time without legal changes. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They are protecting their legal rights and time with their child.\n"
