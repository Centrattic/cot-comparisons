I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a father who's separated from the baby's mother and has a court order for every weekend with their son. The mother is asking him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. He's reluctant because he feels he already has less time (8 out of 30 days) compared to her 22 days.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since there's a court order in place, any changes to the custody arrangement would typically require legal modification. The mother's request to take every second weekend would mean altering the existing order, which the father isn't obligated to agree to without a court's approval. The father's right to his scheduled time is protected by the court, so he's not in the wrong for wanting to maintain that unless the court decides otherwise.\n\nEmotionally, the father is attached to his son and values the time they have. The mother's argument about being in school might imply that her schedule is busy, but the father's time is already limited. The mother's request could be seen as trying to adjust the custody without considering the father's established schedule. However, the mother might have her own reasons for needing more time, like balancing school and parenting. But legally, she can't unilaterally change the court order. The father is within his rights to resist without a court modification.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No), he's not in the wrong because the court order is in place, and he's maintaining his legal right to the time he's been allocated. The mother would need to go through the legal system to change the arrangement.\n"
