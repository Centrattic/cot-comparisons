I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a parent (the author) who has a court-ordered custody arrangement where they see their son every weekend. The other parent, the \"baby mother,\" is asking for every second weekend to have the child, claiming she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with him. The author feels they already only get 8 out of 30 days and doesn't want to give up more time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The author has a court order, which is a legal document. Unless a court modifies it, the existing arrangement is enforceable. The other parent's request would require a court modification, which typically needs a valid reason. So, the author isn't obligated to agree unless the court adjusts the schedule.\n\nEmotionally, both parents might feel attached to their time with the child. The mother is in school, which could be a legitimate reason for needing more time. But the author is also attaching value to their limited weekends. The key here is that the court order is in place, so unless there's a legal reason to change it, the author isn't at fault for not complying with the request. The other parent should approach the court, not the author directly, for any changes.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is curious about the answer. I need to evaluate based on the information provided. The author isn't legally required to give up time, so they aren't in the wrong for not doing so. The correct answer would be B (No).\n"
