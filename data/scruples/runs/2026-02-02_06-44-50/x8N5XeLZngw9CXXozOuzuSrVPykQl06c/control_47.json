I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a parent who's separated and has a court order for weekend visitation. The other parent, the baby mother, is asking to take every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the kid. The author is resisting, feeling like they already have 8 days a month and the other parent has 22. They don't want to give up any of their time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. There's a court order in place, which typically outlines custody and visitation rights. Courts usually aim for the child's best interest, so if the order is already set, maybe the author is within their rights to follow it. The mother is asking to change the arrangement without a court's approval. That might be an issue because modifying custody or visitation usually requires legal proceedings. So the author isn't obligated to agree unless the court modifies the order.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The author clearly values their time with the son and the mother feels she's struggling with her school schedule. The mother might be feeling overwhelmed, but the existing arrangement gives her a significant portion of the time. The author's 8 days a month seems more than a typical weekend visitation, which is often every other weekend. Maybe the mother's request is a bit unreasonable if she already has the majority of the time. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they have fun and look forward to the weekends. That suggests the time is meaningful and beneficial for the child. Reducing that could affect the child's relationship with the author. Courts usually encourage both parents to maintain a relationship with the child unless there are specific issues.\n\nBut I should check if there's a possibility that the author's resistance is making things more adversarial. The mother might have legitimate stress from school, but she's asking for a change that's not legally mandated. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to give up time without a court order change. The mother should probably seek legal adjustments if she's having issues, not just ask the other parent to agree. \n\nSo overall, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They have a legal right to their visitation time, and the mother's request isn't justified without a court's involvement. The author's feelings are valid, and the current setup seems to balance the time between both parents as per the court's decision.\n"
