I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is a parent who has been separated from the baby's mother for three years since their son was born. They have a court order that gives them time with their son every weekend. The baby's mother is asking them to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to find time. She currently has the child 22 out of 30 days, while the author gets 8. The author is conflicted because they really value their weekends with their son and don't want to lose any of that time. The main question is whether the author is the asshole for not wanting to give up their scheduled time.\n\nFirst, the court order is a legal agreement. That's probably in place to ensure both parents have a fair amount of time with the child. The mother is asking for more time, but the author's time is already set by the court. The mother has the child for the majority of the time\u201422 days versus 8. The author is concerned about their own time, which is understandable because they might be worried about their relationship with their son or their own parenting role.\n\nBut the mother's argument is that she's in school now, making it hard to spend time with him. However, if she's already getting 22 days a month, which is about 73% of the time, maybe the court order is already structured with her schedule in mind. The author is being asked to give up every second weekend, which would cut their time in half. That's a significant reduction. The mother should probably address this request through the legal system rather than directly to the author, since modifying a court order usually requires legal proceedings. The author has a right to their scheduled time as per the order. \n\nOn the other hand, if the mother's current 22 days are causing her difficulty due to school, maybe the court order was made under different circumstances. However, the author isn't obligated to change the court order unless it's modified by a judge. The mother's approach seems to be asking the author to voluntarily give up their time, which the author is refusing. The author isn't wrong for holding onto their legal rights. But maybe they should consider the mother's situation and discuss a mutual agreement if possible. However, the mother's request seems abrupt, and the author's response is to protect their own time. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a legal right to their time, and it's reasonable to value that. The mother should go through the proper channels to request a modification. The author's refusal isn't asshole-like; it's about maintaining their relationship with their son. Unless the court order allows for adjustments, the author is justified in not giving up their time. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
