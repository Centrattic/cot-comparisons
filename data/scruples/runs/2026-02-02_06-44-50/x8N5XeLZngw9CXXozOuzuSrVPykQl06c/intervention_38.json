I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to give up some of their parenting time with their son. The situation is that the author has a court order for every weekend with their son, and the mother wants every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard. The author feels like they already have 8 days a month and the mother has 22.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court has already set a schedule. The mother is asking for a change to the existing order. In most jurisdictions, any changes to custody arrangements typically require a court's approval. So even if the mother is in school, the author isn't obligated to agree without going through the legal process. The author isn't in the wrong for not unilaterally changing the court-ordered schedule.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. Both parents probably want to spend time with their child. The mother's argument is that she's struggling with her school schedule, but she already has the majority of the time. The author is concerned about losing time they've already arranged. It's a conflict of interests. However, the author isn't obligated to give up their time unless the court decides otherwise. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the current arrangement is court-ordered, the author isn't violating anything by not agreeing to the mother's request. The mother should pursue legal modifications if needed. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
