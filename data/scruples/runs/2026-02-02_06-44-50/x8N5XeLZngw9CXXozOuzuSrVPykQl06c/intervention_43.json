I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The setup is about a parent who has a court-ordered visitation schedule with their child every weekend. The other parent is asking for every second weekend to spend more time because she's in school and finds it hard. The author is upset about losing any of their time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, which means the visitation rights are legally established. The other parent is requesting a change, but the author isn't in the wrong for not agreeing if the court hasn't modified it. The other parent's situation (being in school) might be a legitimate reason, but unless the court has ruled to adjust the schedule, the original order stands. \n\nNext, the emotional aspect. The author clearly values their time with the child and looks forward to the weekends. The other parent has him 22 days a month, which is a significant majority. The author's time is 8 days, which is less, but the court order is supposed to balance things. The author isn't obligated to give up court-ordered time unless there's a mutual agreement or a court modification. \n\nThe other parent's request comes from a place of needing more time, but the author is standing by their legally protected time. The author isn't being inconsiderate unless they are ignoring the court order or the needs of the child. Since the author is maintaining their time as per the court's decision, they aren't in the wrong. The right answer would be B, No.\n"
