I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent who has a court-ordered visitation every weekend. The other parent, the baby's mother, wants to take every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The question is whether the father is wrong for not wanting to give up his time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The father has a court order for his visitation. Changing that would require a court modification, right? So unless the mother goes through the legal process, he's under no obligation to give up his scheduled time. Courts generally aim for fair visitation, but each case is different. The current arrangement is 8 days a month for the father and 22 for the mother. The mother is saying she doesn't get enough time, but she already has the majority. If she's in school, maybe her schedule is conflicting, but the father's time is fixed by a court. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the father is attached to his son and values the time they have. It's natural for both parents to want to spend time with their child. However, the mother is trying to adjust the arrangement without going through the legal system. The father isn't obligated to change the court order on his own. The mother's request could be valid if her situation has changed, but the process is to go to court, not ask the other parent to agree. \n\nSo the father isn't in the wrong because the court order is in place, and he's not required to negotiate outside of that. The mother should seek a legal modification if she needs more time. The father is justified in wanting to maintain his current visitation schedule. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
