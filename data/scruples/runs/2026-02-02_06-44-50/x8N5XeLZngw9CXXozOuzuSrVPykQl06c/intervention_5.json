I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to give up their weekend time with their son. The situation involves a separated parent with a court order for every weekend visitation. The mother is asking for every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the kid. The author feels they already have 8 days a month and the mother has 22, so they don't want to give up any time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, which means the author's visitation rights are legally established. The mother is requesting a change, but unless the court modifies the order, the author isn't obligated to comply. So legally, the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nEmotionally, both parents might feel they need more time. The mother is in school, which could make her time management harder. But the author is also attached to their weekend visits. The key point is that the mother's request isn't legally binding unless the court adjusts it. The author's refusal isn't against the law. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a middle ground. But the question is about being in the wrong. The author isn't violating the law or the court order, so unless there's a moral obligation, they aren't at fault. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
