I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a parent who has a court-ordered custody arrangement where they get to see their son every weekend. The other parent (the baby mother) is asking to take every second weekend from them because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The parent is conflicted because they don't want to give up their time.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspect. They have a court order, which is a legal agreement. If the other parent is asking them to change the arrangement without going through the court, that might not be valid. The court order is in place for a reason, so any changes would typically require a legal process. The parent in question isn't obligated to agree to the change unless the court modifies it.\n\nThen, the emotional side. The parent looks forward to their weekends with their son and they have a good time. It's natural for a parent to want to maintain their bonding time. The other parent is in school, which could be a temporary situation, but the current arrangement already gives her 22 days a month. The parent here is just trying to hold onto their scheduled time.\n\nI should consider if there's any indication the parent is being selfish. They are following the court order and not forcing the other parent to do anything. The other parent is the one initiating the request. The parent in the question is not the one violating any terms; they're maintaining their legal right. Unless there's a legal requirement to negotiate or adjust the schedule, they aren't in the wrong.\n\nAlso, the response should be either A or B. The question is straightforward: is the author in the wrong? Based on the court order and the parent's right to their scheduled time, the answer would be B (No). They aren't at fault here.\n"
