I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to give up their weekend parenting time with their son. The situation is that the parent has a court order for every weekend, but the ex wants every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the kid. The author is hesitant to give up any time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so changing it would typically require legal action. The ex is asking for a change, but the author isn't obligated to agree unless the court modifies the order. So legally, the author isn't in the wrong by not agreeing. \n\nEmotionally and ethically, the author values their time with the child and wants to maintain the existing schedule. The ex parent has the majority of the time (22 days vs. 8), so maybe the author's time is already limited. The ex's reasoning is about school, but the author is concerned about losing their scheduled time. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is the asshole. The key factors are: existing court order, the value of the time the author has, and the ex's request. The author isn't violating the court order by not giving up the time. The ex would need to go through the legal process to change it, not just ask. So the author isn't in the wrong for holding their ground. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author should be more flexible. But since the court order is in place, the author isn't obligated. The answer should be B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
