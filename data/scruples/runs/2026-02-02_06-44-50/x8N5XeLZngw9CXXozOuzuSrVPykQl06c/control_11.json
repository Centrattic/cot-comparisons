I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is the asshole for not wanting to give up their weekend time with their son. The parent has a court order for every weekend, and the other parent is asking for every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the kid. The user wants to know if the author is wrong here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, which means the time arrangement is legally binding. The mother is asking the father to voluntarily give up his time beyond what's ordered. Legally, he isn't required to do that unless the court modifies the order. So, from a legal standpoint, he's not in the wrong for not agreeing to change the terms without a court modification.\n\nThen there's the emotional and practical side. The father only sees the child 8 days a month and really values that time. The mother, on the other hand, has the child 22 days and is trying to get more. The mother's reason is that she's in school, but that might not directly relate to the time she already has. It's possible she's struggling to balance school and parenting, but the father isn't obligated to adjust his schedule unless it's court-ordered. \n\nI should also think about fairness. The current arrangement gives the mother the majority of the time. If she's saying she doesn't have enough time, maybe there's an underlying issue, like how she's using the time she already has. The father's attachment to the weekends is understandable, especially if they've built a strong bond during those visits. \n\nThere's also the question of whether the mother's request is reasonable. Courts usually consider the best interests of the child when setting custody. If the current arrangement is already established by a court, changing it without a valid reason or court approval might not be fair. The father isn't the one initiating changes, so he's just maintaining the status quo. \n\nAnother angle: communication. The mother approached him at drop-off, but maybe they should have discussed this in a more formal setting or through legal channels, especially if the request is significant. The father isn't required to negotiate outside of the court order. \n\nIn summary, the father isn't in the wrong because the court order is in place, and he's not legally obligated to give up his time. His desire to maintain the current schedule is valid, especially since the mother has the majority of the time already. The mother's reasons might be personal, but that doesn't obligate the father to adjust his time. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
