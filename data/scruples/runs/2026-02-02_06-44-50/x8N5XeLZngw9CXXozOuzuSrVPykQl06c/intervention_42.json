I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent who's separated from the child's mother and has a court-ordered custody arrangement. The mother is asking for every second weekend to have the child, arguing that she's busy with school. The father is resisting because he feels his time is already limited.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so any changes would require legal agreement, not just an informal arrangement. The mother's request to take the child every other weekend would mean the father's time is reduced from 8 to 4 days a month. That's a significant cut, especially since he's already only getting a fraction of the days.\n\nThe mother is in school, but she already has custody 22 days a month. Maybe her schedule is tight, but that doesn't necessarily justify reducing the father's time without mutual agreement. The father's argument is about not wanting to lose time with his son, which is a valid emotional concern. Custody arrangements are often about balancing both parents' needs, but the current order is set by the court. If the mother wants a change, she'd need to go through legal channels, not just ask the father to agree.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. The father is following the court order, so unless there's a legal reason to change it, he isn't in the wrong by not giving up his time. The mother should pursue legal modifications if needed. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
