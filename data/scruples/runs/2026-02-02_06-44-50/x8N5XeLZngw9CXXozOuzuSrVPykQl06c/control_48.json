I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about custody time with their son. The parent has a court order for every weekend, which is 8 days a month. The baby's mother wants every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with him. The father is reluctant to give up his weekends and is wondering if he's being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to check the facts. The court order is in place, which legally defines the custody arrangement. The mother is asking for a change, but the father is resisting. Since there's a court order, any modifications would typically require legal action. The mother's argument is that her current schedule (22 days) makes it hard to be with the child, but the father's time is only 8 days. The original arrangement might be set to balance both parents' time, but after three years, maybe the mother's situation has changed. However, without a court modification, changing it without mutual agreement could be problematic.\n\nConsider the legal aspect. The father has the right to his court-ordered time. The mother can't unilaterally change it; she would need to go through the court to request a modification. The father is within his rights to not agree to the change unless legally required. So, he's not in the wrong for sticking to the existing order.\n\nAlso, the emotional angle. The father clearly values his time with the son and they have a good relationship. The mother's situation might be tough, but the father's time is limited, and altering it without mutual agreement might not be fair. The mother should perhaps discuss this with a lawyer to adjust the custody arrangement properly.\n\nPossible biases: Maybe the mother is using her school schedule as an excuse, but that's not clear. The key is the court order. As long as the father is following it, he's not the asshole. The mother should seek legal means to change it. So answer B: No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
