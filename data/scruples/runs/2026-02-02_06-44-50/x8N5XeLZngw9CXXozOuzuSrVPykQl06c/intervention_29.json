I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent who has court-ordered visitation every weekend with their son. The other parent wants every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the kid. The author is reluctant to give up any of their time.\n\nFirst, the court order is key here. If the original agreement was set by a court, it's legally binding. So any changes should probably go through the legal system, not just an informal agreement. The mother is asking the non-custodial parent to give up time without court involvement. That's a red flag. The author has a legal right to their visitation unless the court modifies it.\n\nAlso, the custody arrangement: the mother has 22 days and the father has 8. That's a significant split. The mother is in school, which might affect her time, but the existing arrangement already gives her the majority of the time. The father's time is limited, so he's not the one in a better position to adjust. The mother should be the one seeking a modification if her circumstances have changed, but she can't just ask the other parent to agree without legal process.\n\nThe author's feelings are valid. They look forward to the weekends and bond with their son. The mother's request is reasonable in terms of wanting more time, but the existing court order is the main issue. The author isn't in the wrong for not giving up time without a court order change. The mother should pursue legal modifications if she needs it. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
