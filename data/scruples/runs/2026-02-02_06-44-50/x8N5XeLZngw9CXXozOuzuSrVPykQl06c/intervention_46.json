I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

The mother is asking him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the kid. The father is resisting because he only gets 8 days a month and doesn't want to lose any time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so any changes would require a modification. The mother can't unilaterally take away the father's time without legal action. The father is within his rights to follow the court order.\n\nThen, the emotional and practical sides. The father values his time with the son, which is understandable. The mother's situation with being in school might be a valid reason for her to want more time, but she already has 22 days. The father's time is limited, so giving up half could significantly reduce his bonding time.\n\nBut the key point is the court order. If the mother wants to change it, she needs to go through the legal system. The father isn't in the wrong for not agreeing to give up time without a court decision. So the answer is B.\n"
