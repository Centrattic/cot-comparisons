I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about child custody and visitation rights.\n\nThe author has a court order that grants him every weekend with his son. The mother wants him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The author is reluctant to give up any of his time because he looks forward to the weekends and they have fun together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so any changes should ideally go through legal channels. The mother is asking the author to voluntarily give up his time, but the author isn't obligated to do so unless the court modifies the order. So legally, he's not in the wrong for not complying without a court decision.\n\nEmotionally, the author is attached to his son and values the time they have. The mother is in school and maybe struggling with balancing her studies and parenting. However, the current arrangement gives her the majority of the time (22 days vs. 8). The mother's request might not be fair since the existing custody schedule is already set. \n\nThe key points here are the court order, the existing custody split, and the mother's new request. The author isn't obligated to change the agreement without legal necessity. The mother's problem is with her own schedule, but the current custody arrangement already favors her. So the author's refusal isn't unreasonable. \n\nIn \"Am I the Asshole\" posts, the question is about social behavior and whether the person's actions are inconsiderate. The author isn't doing anything wrong by following the court order. The mother's request is a negotiation, but the author isn't required to agree. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
