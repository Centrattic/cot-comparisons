I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a separated parent who has a court-ordered custody arrangement, getting his son every weekend. The ex wants to take every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The parent in question is reluctant to give up any of his time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since there's a court order in place, that's legally binding. The court's decision is supposed to be in the best interest of the child. So unless the court modifies the order, the parent isn't obligated to agree to changes outside of that. The ex's request is outside the current arrangement, so the author isn't legally in the wrong by not agreeing.\n\nEmotionally and relationally, it's a different story. The author might be seen as resistant to compromise, which could affect the child's relationship with the mother. However, the current custody split is 22/8, which is a significant discrepancy. The author's time is limited, and he's using it to bond with the child. The mother's claim of needing more time is understandable, but the existing court order might already prioritize her primary custody. \n\nThe key points are the existing legal agreement and the best interest of the child. Since the court order is in place, the author isn't at fault for adhering to it. The mother's request could require legal action to change the order, which the author isn't obligated to comply with without a court modification. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
