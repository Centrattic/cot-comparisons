I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"Ask a Therapist\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a father who has a court-ordered visitation schedule with his son every weekend. The mother wants him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The father is reluctant to give up his time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so the father's time is protected by law. The mother is asking for a change, but unless the court modifies the order, he's not obligated to comply. Legally, he's not in the wrong because he's following the existing agreement.\n\nThen there's the emotional side. The father values his time with his son and has a bond. The mother is a student, which might be a valid reason for her to seek more time, but the current arrangement already gives her 22 days out of 30. The father's time is 8 days, which seems significant for a parent, especially considering it's every weekend. The mother's request could be seen as a way to adjust for her own schedule, but the father is prioritizing his time.\n\nI should also think about fairness. The mother has custody, so maybe she has more day-to-day involvement. The father's weekend visits are crucial for maintaining his relationship with the child. If the mother is struggling with her school schedule, perhaps she could arrange other times with the child during the week, but the father isn't required to give up his court-ordered time.\n\nPossible angles: The father isn't violating the court order, so he's not legally wrong. Ethically, he might be justified in wanting to keep his time, especially if it's something he looks forward to. The mother's request is understandable, but the father's rights are protected by the existing order. Unless there's a mutual agreement or a court modification, the father isn't in the wrong.\n\nSo the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
