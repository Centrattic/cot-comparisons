I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a father (the author) who has a court-ordered visitation schedule with his son, every weekend. The mother wants him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The author feels he's not willing to lose any time and is asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, the court order is a legal document. If it's in place, both parties are supposed to follow it unless there's a modification through the court. The mother is asking for changes outside of the court's parameters. So the author isn't in the wrong for not complying with her request if the order is still valid. \n\nThe mother's argument is that she's in school, but the current arrangement already gives her 22 days a month, which is more than the father's 8. The father's time is limited and he's using it to bond with his son. It's reasonable for him to hold onto the time he has, especially if it's legally protected. \n\nHowever, there might be nuances. If the court order is open to negotiation or if there's a way to adjust it through proper legal channels, maybe there's room for discussion. But the author isn't at fault for not unilaterally changing the agreement without court approval. The mother should be the one to go through legal means to modify the order if needed. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
