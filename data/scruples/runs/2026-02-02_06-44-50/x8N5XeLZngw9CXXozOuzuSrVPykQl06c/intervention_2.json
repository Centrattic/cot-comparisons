I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a separated parent who has a court-ordered custody arrangement where they get their son every weekend. The other parent, the baby mother, is asking to switch to every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to manage time. The author is reluctant to give up any of their 8 days a month, thinking they're the only ones with the child, but the other parent has the child 22 days out of the month.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so unless there's a modification, the existing arrangement is supposed to be followed. The baby mother is requesting a change, but the author is not willing to comply without a court's decision. The author might not be in the wrong if they're sticking to the legal agreement.\n\nBut wait, the user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but now wants to know my opinion. The author's argument is that they don't want to lose any time since they look forward to it. The other parent is in school, which could be a valid reason for needing more time. However, the current custody is 22/8 split, which is a significant imbalance. The baby mother already has the majority of the time. If she's asking for even more, maybe every second weekend, that would reduce the author's time further. But if the court order is 8 days, and the baby mother is requesting a change, the author is not obligated to do so without a legal process. \n\nWait, the problem states that the author is asking if they're wrong for not wanting to give up time. The baby mother already has 22 days. If the current arrangement is court-ordered, then the author isn't legally in the wrong by not agreeing to change it. The baby mother should seek a court modification if she wants to adjust the custody schedule. The author's time is protected by the order, so the author's refusal isn't necessarily in the wrong. Unless the court order allows for some flexibility, but the post doesn't mention that. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the custody is determined by a court order. The other parent's request should be handled through legal channels, not just by mutual agreement. The author's time is legally protected, so they aren't wrong for not giving it up without a court's say-so. The initial thought of the user that the author is in the wrong might be because they feel the other parent deserves more time, but the court order is the key factor here.\n"
