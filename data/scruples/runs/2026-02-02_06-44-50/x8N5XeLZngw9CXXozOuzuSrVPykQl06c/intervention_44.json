I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent who has a court-ordered visitation every weekend with his son. The other parent, the baby's mother, wants him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The author is reluctant to give up any time since he only gets 8 out of 30 days.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. There's a court order in place, which means the visitation schedule is legally binding. The mother is asking the author to alter the schedule outside of the court order. Legally, the author isn't obligated to change it unless the court modifies the order. So from that standpoint, the author isn't in the wrong legally.\n\nNext, the emotional and parenting aspects. The author values his time with his son and they have a good relationship. The mother is in school and claims she doesn't have enough time. However, the current arrangement gives her 22 days, which is a majority of the time. It's possible she's struggling with balancing school and parenting, but that doesn't necessarily mean the father should sacrifice his time. The key issue here is whether the father's refusal to give up time is reasonable.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides. The mother's request is about her needs, but the father's feelings and the court order are also important. Since the court order is in place, the father isn't obligated to change it. However, if both parents are willing to negotiate, that's up to them. But the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to change the court-ordered time. Unless the court modifies the order, the father is within his rights to maintain the schedule. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
