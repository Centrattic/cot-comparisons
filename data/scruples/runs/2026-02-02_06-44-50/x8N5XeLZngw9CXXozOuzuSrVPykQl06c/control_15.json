I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent who has a court order for every weekend with their son, and the other parent wants every second weekend because they're busy with school. The original poster (OP) is wondering if they're being selfish by not wanting to give up their time.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the basics of child custody and visitation rights. A court order is a legal document, so any changes to it would typically require a court's approval. The OP is following the current arrangement, which gives them 8 days a month and the other parent 22. That's a significant imbalance. The other parent is in school, which might be a legitimate reason for needing more flexibility, but the court order already exists. \n\nThe key point here is that the other parent is asking for a change without involving the court. The OP isn't obligated to agree to that unless the court modifies the order. The fact that the other parent is making the request at drop-off might be a bit inconsiderate, but the OP's time is protected by the court. The OP's concern is valid because they're the ones who have to adjust their schedule every weekend, and the other parent already has the majority of the time. \n\nAlso, the emotional aspect is important. The OP looks forward to the weekends and spends quality time with their son. Reducing that time could impact their relationship. The other parent's situation (school) is temporary, so maybe there are other ways to handle their schedule without taking time away from the OP. \n\nI should check if there are any laws about modifying custody without court. In most jurisdictions, a court order can be modified, but both parents usually need to agree or the court has to see a significant change in circumstances. The OP isn't in the wrong for not agreeing to the request without legal changes. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're sticking to the court order, and the other parent should seek legal modifications if needed.\n"
