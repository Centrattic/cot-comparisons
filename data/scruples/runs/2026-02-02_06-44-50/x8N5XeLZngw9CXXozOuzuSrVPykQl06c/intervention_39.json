I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a separated parent with a court-ordered custody arrangement. The author (presumably the father) is being asked by the mother to give up every other weekend, which would reduce his time from 8 days a month to maybe 4. The mother's reasoning is that she's in school and it's hard for her to spend time with the child.\n\nFirst, the court order is key here. Since there's a legal agreement in place, the author isn't obligated to give up his time unless the court modifies the order. The mother is asking for a change, but that's not something they can negotiate on their own; typically, custody modifications require court approval. The author has a right to his court-ordered time. \n\nThe mother has the child 22 days a month, which is more than half the time, so the author's 8 days are already less. The mother might feel she needs more time due to her school schedule, but the author's time is established by law. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but I think the opposite. The author isn't being unreasonable by holding onto his legally protected time. The mother should be the one approaching the court for a modification, not expecting the other parent to agree without legal process. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
