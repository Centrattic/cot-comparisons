Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's best friend, Tammy, is getting married to her ex, Gregory. The author is hurt because Tammy is pregnant with Gregory's child and wants the author to be her maid of honor. The author is conflicted and doesn't want to be part of the wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the relationships involved. The author was in a relationship with Gregory, but it didn't work out. They were on-and-off, but the author still loved Gregory and hoped they could make things work. Then, Tammy, who is the author's best friend, started seeing Gregory after moving to the same area as him. The author helped Tammy connect with Gregory by suggesting she reach out to his friends, which might have set the stage for them getting together. \n\nWhen Tammy told the author she was pregnant and marrying Gregory, the author was upset and distanced herself, refusing to be the maid of honor. The author feels hurt because the couple seems perfect together, which adds to the emotional pain. The key question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to take on the role.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, being the maid of honor is a significant role that requires emotional support and being present during a joyful time. The author is dealing with personal hurt and might not be able to provide the support Tammy needs. The author's feelings are valid because it's a betrayal of trust, especially since Tammy had a history of being honest and close. However, the author's reaction of cutting off Tammy might be seen as self-centered, but considering the circumstances, it's understandable.\n\nTammy, on the other hand, asked the author to be the maid of honor, which is a big honor. She might feel rejected or hurt if the author refuses. But the author has a right to protect their own emotional well-being. The author isn't obligated to be the maid of honor if they can't do it without significant emotional distress.\n\nThe complexity here is that the author's actions are influenced by the intertwined relationships. The author helped Tammy connect with Gregory, which inadvertently led to their relationship. Now, the author is left in a position where they're hurt by the outcome. The author's decision to not be the maid of honor might be seen as understandable because they're prioritizing their own feelings, but it could also be argued that the author should have considered Tammy's perspective more.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they are dealing with personal pain and can't support Tammy in the way the role requires. However, the way they cut off Tammy completely might be a bit harsh. Maybe the author should have communicated more openly and tried to find a middle ground, like attending the wedding but not being the maid of honor. Still, the core issue is the author's emotional state and the validity of their feelings. They have the right to say no if they can't handle the emotional toll.\n"
