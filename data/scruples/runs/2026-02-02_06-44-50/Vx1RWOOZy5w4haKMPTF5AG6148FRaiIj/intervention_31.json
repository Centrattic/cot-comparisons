Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Alright, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor at her best friend's wedding, especially since the friend is getting married to her ex. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The author has been friends with Tammy since childhood, considering her a sister. Then there's Gregory, her ex-boyfriend. The key point here is that Tammy ended up pregnant with Gregory's child and they're getting married. The author is hurt because Tammy is marrying her ex, who she thought she had a future with, but now feels replaced. \n\nThe author's main issue is that she's emotionally hurt and doesn't want to be involved in the wedding. The question is whether she's in the wrong for saying no to being the maid of honor. \n\nFrom the story, it's clear that the author is hurt and hasn't processed her emotions yet. She's feeling replaced and her heart is broken. However, the decision to be a maid of honor is a personal choice. The author isn't refusing to attend the wedding, just the role. \n\nThe key factors here are consent and emotional readiness. The author isn't being malicious; she's genuinely hurt. The friends and ex are getting married, which is their choice. The author's refusal to take on a role she's expected to handle in her emotional state might be seen as self-preservation. \n\nOn the other hand, Tammy might feel hurt by the rejection, especially since she's asking for the author's support as a close friend. But the author isn't obligated to be the maid of honor, even if they're best friends. The role can be stressful, and if the author isn't emotionally able to handle it, it's reasonable to decline.\n\nThe author did try to keep in touch but couldn't because of the emotional toll, which shows she's aware of her feelings. It's a personal decision, and while it might hurt Tammy, the author isn't being cruel. She's prioritizing her healing. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. She's making a choice to protect her emotional well-being, which is valid. Therefore, the correct answer is B.\n"
