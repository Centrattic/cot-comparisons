Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor at her best friend's wedding, which is also the wedding of her ex. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong but is now curious.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are: the best friend (Tammy) is getting married to the author's ex (Gregory), who they were on and off for years. The author is hurt because Tammy is pregnant with Gregory's child and now they're getting married. The author refuses to be the maid of honor, even going so far as to avoid seeing Tammy and not attending the wedding.\n\nNow, considering the emotional aspects. The author is clearly hurt and devastated. They had a close relationship with Tammy and had feelings for Gregory. The fact that their best friend is marrying someone they were in love with would naturally cause a lot of pain. The author's reaction is emotional\u2014crying, avoiding Tammy, and declining the maid of honor role. \n\nFrom a social standpoint, being the maid of honor is a significant role, usually reserved for the closest friends or family. The author is choosing not to take it because they can't handle the emotional conflict. The question is whether this makes them the \"asshole.\"\n\nArguments for the author being in the wrong (A): They might be cutting off a close friend during a big life event. The friend apologized and tried to maintain the relationship. The author's refusal could be seen as self-centered or immature, especially since they were the one who connected Tammy with Gregory in the first place. Also, maybe the author should have matured and handled the situation gracefully despite the pain.\n\nArguments for the author not being in the wrong (B): The situation is extremely complex and emotional. The author has every right to feel hurt and overwhelmed. They are not obligated to be the maid of honor if they can't handle the emotional burden. It's a personal choice, and the author isn't in a position to be expected to support the wedding without personal feelings involved. They are prioritizing their own emotional well-being.\n\nThe user initially thought the author was in the wrong but now is uncertain. The user's own opinion might be swayed by whether the author's actions were inconsiderate or a natural reaction to betrayal and heartbreak.\n\nIn many cases, people have differing opinions on this. Some might say the author is justified in prioritizing their well-being, while others might feel the author should make an effort for their best friend despite the hurt. The key is whether the author's refusal is seen as selfish or a necessary personal choice.\n\nConsidering that the author is experiencing genuine emotional trauma and the situation is complicated by their past relationship with Gregory, it's more likely that the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to step back from a role that would cause them significant distress. However, it's important to communicate this respectfully, which the author tried to do but perhaps could have been more understanding of Tammy's feelings as well.\n\nSo, the answer would lean towards B (Not in the wrong) because of the complex emotional circumstances and the right to prioritize one's well-being.\n"
