Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor for her best friend who is marrying her ex. The story is complicated, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author has been friends with Tammy since elementary school. They're really close, like sisters. Then there's Gregory, who was the author's college boyfriend. They had an on-again, off-again relationship. The author didn't really push for a long-term commitment, though. Gregory moved away, but stayed in touch. \n\nThen, Tammy moves to a city near Gregory and starts hanging out with him. The author suggested Tammy connect with Gregory to meet new people. That's when the flirty texts from Gregory stop. Months later, Tammy reveals she's pregnant with Gregory's child and they're getting married. The author is hurt and refuses to be the maid of honor or attend the wedding. \n\nThe author feels that Tammy and Gregory are a perfect match, but the author is just hurt. The question is if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to take the role.\n\nSo, from what I understand, the author isn't wrong because she's dealing with personal hurt. Her best friend is marrying someone she was involved with, which is a sensitive situation. The fact that Tammy sought the author's advice to connect with Gregory might imply some level of trust, but it's not clear if the author encouraged that. However, the main point is the emotional response. The author is allowed to feel hurt and not want to be part of the wedding. \n\nTammy and Gregory's relationship leading to marriage is their choice, and the author isn't obligated to be happy about it. The role of a maid of honor is a personal commitment, and if the author can't handle the emotions, it's understandable. The author didn't push for the relationship to continue, so it's not her fault they ended up together. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. She's justified in her feelings and decision not to take the role because of the personal pain involved.\n"
