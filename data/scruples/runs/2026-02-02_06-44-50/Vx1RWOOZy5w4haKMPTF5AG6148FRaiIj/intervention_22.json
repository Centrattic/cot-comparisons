Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor at her best friend's wedding, especially since the friend is marrying her ex.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The author, let's call her \"Me,\" has been best friends with Tammy since elementary school. They're very close. Then there's Gregory, her ex, who she had an on-again, off-again relationship with. Gregory and Tammy ended up getting together, and Tammy is pregnant with his child, planning to marry him. Me is hurt and can't be the maid of honor.\n\nThe key points here are the emotional dynamics. Me feels hurt because her best friend is marrying her ex, and they make a good couple. She's not mad at Tammy but is emotionally affected. She's also struggling with the idea of being part of the wedding, which is a big commitment and a significant event.\n\nNow, the question is whether Me is in the wrong. From what I read, Me is allowed to feel hurt and to set boundaries for her own emotional well-being. Being a maid of honor involves a lot of responsibility and being present at the wedding. If she can't manage the emotional strain, it's understandable she might decline. However, the friend might feel rejected or think that Me is prioritizing her past with Gregory over their friendship.\n\nBut considering that Me didn't know about the pregnancy and the engagement until later, and the shock she experienced, it's reasonable for her to need time to process. Her decision isn't out of malice but genuine hurt and the inability to handle the situation. The fact that she loves Tammy and the baby is also important\u2014she's not dismissing the new family but dealing with her feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, Tammy might feel that Me's refusal is a betrayal, especially since she had always wanted her as the maid of honor. But Me isn't obligated to be the maid of honor. It's a personal choice, and she's not wrong for prioritizing her emotional state. Relationships can be complex, and everyone has the right to set boundaries, especially in such a sensitive situation.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that Me isn't in the wrong. She's dealing with a lot of emotions and isn't choosing between friends; she's dealing with a personal hurt. Therefore, the correct answer is B.\n"
