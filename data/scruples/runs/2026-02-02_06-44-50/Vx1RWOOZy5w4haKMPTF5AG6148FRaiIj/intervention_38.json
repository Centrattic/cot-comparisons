Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor at her best friend's wedding because the friend is marrying her ex. The story is pretty complicated.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author has been best friends with Tammy since elementary school. They're really close, like family. Then there's Gregory, the author's former college boyfriend. They had an on-again, off-again relationship. The author never explicitly told Gregory that she wanted them to be together long-term. Gregory moved away, but they stayed in touch. Tammy moved to a city near Gregory and the author suggested she reach out to him to meet his friends. Tammy did that, and then she got pregnant with Gregory's child. They're getting married.\n\nThe author is upset because Tammy is marrying her ex, and she's not willing to be the maid of honor. The question is whether the author is in the wrong here. \n\nSo, the key points here are: \n\n1. The author is the best friend and was supposed to be the maid of honor. \n2. Tammy is marrying someone the author was in a relationship with, which is causing emotional pain. \n3. The author is hurt because her best friend is with someone she was trying to reconcile with herself. \n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The author had a long-term relationship with Gregory, even though they kept breaking up. The author didn't clearly communicate her intentions to Gregory. Tammy, as a friend, might not have known the full extent of the author's feelings. The author also facilitated Tammy meeting Gregory, so maybe there's some responsibility there. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor? Well, being the maid of honor is a significant role, and the author is clearly hurt. The question is whether her feelings are valid. If she's not able to be there emotionally, maybe it's reasonable for her to step back. However, turning down a best friend who has been a sister-like figure might seem harsh. \n\nBut the other angle is that the author contributed to the situation by suggesting Tammy meet Gregory. If she knew they were both into each other, maybe she set the stage for this. However, she didn't know they would end up together. The author is in a lot of emotional pain here. \n\nIs it wrong to not want to be the maid of honor? Being in a difficult emotional position, it's understandable she can't do it. The question is about being an asshole, not about being wrong. If the author is honest with Tammy and explains her feelings without being vindictive, maybe it's not wrong. But if she's being selfish or not considering Tammy's feelings, then she might be in the wrong. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is being unreasonable. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because she's dealing with personal pain. But the fact that she's the best friend who was supposed to be the maid of honor might make it seem like she's prioritizing her own feelings over her friend's. However, it's also about her emotional well-being. \n\nSo, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (B). She's allowed to prioritize her own feelings here. Even though it's a big role, if she can't be there for her friend emotionally, it's understandable. The question is about being an asshole, not about being wrong. If she's not being cruel or dismissive, then she's not the asshole.\n"
