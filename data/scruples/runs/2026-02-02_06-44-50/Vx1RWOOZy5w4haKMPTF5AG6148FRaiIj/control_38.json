Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor at her best friend's wedding because her friend is pregnant and marrying the author's ex. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author (AITA) has been best friends with Tammy for a long time. They're very close, like sisters. Then there's Gregory, the author's ex. They had an on-again, off-again relationship. The author never really thought they'd end up together, but stayed in touch. Tammy moved to a city near Gregory, and the author suggested Tammy connect with him to meet people. That led to Tammy and Gregory getting together, and now Tammy is pregnant with his child and they're getting married. The author is hurt and doesn't want to be the maid of honor or even attend the wedding.\n\nThe key points here are the relationships between the three people. The author feels betrayed because her best friend is with her ex, someone she thought she had a future with. But she also didn't stop Tammy from connecting with Gregory, even encouraged it. The author is now upset that the outcome is this. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to take on the maid of honor role. The author's reasoning is that she's hurt and doesn't want to be involved in the wedding. But is that a valid reason? Well, the maid of honor role is a big commitment, and if the author is going to be emotionally distressed, it might not be a good idea. But since Tammy is her best friend, is the author being selfish by not stepping up?\n\nAlso, considering that the author was the one who suggested Tammy get involved with Gregory's group. Maybe she feels responsible for the situation. But does that make her obligated to be the maid of honor? Probably not. The author has the right to her feelings. However, she's cutting off her best friend, which is where the conflict comes in.\n\nThe core issue is the emotional response. The author is hurt, which is understandable. But the question is about being in the wrong. If the author is not attending or being the maid of honor, is that wrong? Well, the author is not in the wrong for prioritizing her own emotional well-being. However, the way she's handling it\u2014cutting off Tammy and refusing without giving a chance for reconciliation\u2014could be seen as harsh. \n\nBut the prompt says the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer would depend on whether her feelings are justified. Since she's the one who encouraged the connection, maybe she feels responsible. However, Tammy made the choice to pursue the relationship. The author's refusal to be the maid of honor isn't about the relationship itself but her personal feelings. So, in terms of morality, is she wrong? Probably not. She's not obligated to be the maid of honor if she's not comfortable. However, if she's the best friend, maybe she should try to find a compromise. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about what's best for the situation. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because she's not obligated to be the maid of honor if she's hurt and doesn't want to be involved. She's allowed to prioritize her feelings here.\n"
