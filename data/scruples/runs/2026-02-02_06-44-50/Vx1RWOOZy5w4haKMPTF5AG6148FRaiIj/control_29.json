Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's best friend, Tammy, is getting married to Gregory, the author's ex-boyfriend. The author is being asked to be the maid of honor but doesn't want to. The key points here are the relationships and the emotions involved.\n\nFirst, the author has been best friends with Tammy since elementary school. That's a long time, and they're very close. Then there's the ex-boyfriend Gregory. They had an on-again, off-again relationship that lasted through college. The author loved him but it didn't work out. Now, Tammy is pregnant with Gregory's child and they're getting married. The author is hurt and can't bring themselves to be part of the wedding, even being in the wedding party. The author isn't mad at Tammy but is really sad and can't handle being around them right now.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor. Let's break it down. The author's reasons are based on their personal feelings of hurt and sadness. They mention that Tammy is like a sister and that they love her, but the situation with Gregory complicates things. The author feels that they can't be around Tammy at this time because of the emotional pain.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they have a right to their feelings. The maid of honor role is significant and requires a certain level of emotional comfort and support. If the author can't provide that due to personal pain, it's understandable. However, some might argue that as a best friend, the author should put aside their hurt to support Tammy in her big day. But others might say that it's reasonable for the author to prioritize their own well-being.\n\nAdditionally, the situation isn't straightforward. The ex-boyfriend and best friend getting together complicates the dynamics. The author's feelings are valid, especially considering the history with Gregory. It's also worth noting that Tammy and Gregory are a good match, but the author is still hurt by the situation. The author's decision isn't about rejecting Tammy but about their own emotional state.\n\nIn many cases, people go through difficult times in relationships and might need space, especially when it's a mix of friendship and past romantic involvement. The author's response isn't malicious; they're trying to process their feelings. The key here is whether the author's refusal is a result of selfishness or genuine emotional conflict. Since the author is honest about their feelings and not intentionally hurting Tammy, it seems more about personal hurt than being in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're dealing with a complex emotional situation and are prioritizing their own well-being, which is a valid response.\n"
