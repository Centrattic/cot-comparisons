Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is best friends with Tammy, who is getting married to Gregory, the author's ex. The author is hurt because her best friend is marrying someone she was in a complicated relationship with. The question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author and Gregory had a long-term on-again, off-again relationship. They were in college together and had a history. Then Tammy, the author's best friend, starts seeing Gregory, gets pregnant, and they get married. The author feels hurt and doesn't want to be part of the wedding party. \n\nThe key points here are about feelings and personal boundaries. The author is clearly emotional about this situation. The question is whether her decision not to be the maid of honor is justified or if she's wrong to feel that way. \n\nOne angle is that the author has a right to feel hurt. If Gregory was a significant ex and Tammy was a best friend, their relationship getting together could be a shock and a source of pain. The author might not be ready to move past that, especially with the wedding happening. \n\nOn the other hand, being a maid of honor is a big commitment and a close role in a friend's wedding. If the author isn't able to support her friend through this, maybe she's not in the right frame of mind to take on that responsibility. There's also the aspect of loyalty to the friend. Even if hurt, being there for Tammy might be expected, especially since the author was the one who suggested Tammy connect with Gregory in the first place. \n\nBut the author isn't denying the friendship or the pregnancy; she's just struggling with the emotional impact. It's possible that her feelings are valid, and she's not in the wrong for needing space. However, the fact that she was the one who introduced Tammy to Gregory's circle might add another layer. If she knew about their dynamic, maybe she has some responsibility to support her friend now, even if it's painful. \n\nAnother consideration is whether the author is overstepping. The wedding is a happy event, and if she's not able to be there without resentment, maybe it's better for everyone if she steps back. But is it fair to her to be asked to be the maid of honor in this situation? \n\nI think the answer depends on the depth of the author's feelings. If she truly can't be supportive, then she's not in the wrong for not accepting the role. But if she's being selfish or not handling the situation maturely, then she might be. However, given the complexity of the relationships, her feelings are understandable. \n\nSo, between A and B, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's dealing with emotional pain and might not be able to fulfill the role adequately. It's a personal decision about her emotional state, and she has the right to prioritize her well-being.\n"
