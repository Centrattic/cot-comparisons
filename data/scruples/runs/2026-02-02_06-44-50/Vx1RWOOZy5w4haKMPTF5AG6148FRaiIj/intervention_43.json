Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor at her best friend's wedding, especially since the friend is getting married to her ex. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author has been friends with Tammy since elementary school. They're really close, like sisters. Then there's Gregory, her ex-boyfriend. They had on-again, off-again relationship throughout college. The author didn't tell Gregory her long-term plan of being with him, so maybe that's a point. Tammy moved near Gregory, started hanging out, and eventually they got together and had a baby. The author is hurt because they're getting married, and she doesn't want to be the maid of honor.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for declining. Let's look at the key points. The author is friends with Tammy, who is marrying Gregory, the ex. The author is upset because she's the one who connected them. She feels hurt and can't handle being part of their wedding. The main issue is emotional distress from the situation.\n\nIs there a betrayal here? Well, Tammy and Gregory started dating. The author didn't know. The author isn't necessarily wrong for being hurt; that's a natural reaction. But is she in the wrong for not wanting to be part of the wedding? The maid of honor role is a big responsibility. If she's not emotionally ready to handle it, maybe it's reasonable. On the other hand, Tammy might have expected her to be there since they were close.\n\nBut the author isn't refusing to attend the wedding entirely\u2014she's just declining the maid of honor role. If she can attend but not take on the role, that might be acceptable. However, she's stating she can't even go to the wedding. Wait, in the story, she says she can't go to their wedding at all. Wait, no, let me check again. She says she couldn't even go to their wedding let alone be in the wedding party. Wait, but the title says she's not wanting to be the maid of honor. Wait, the initial question is about not wanting to be the maid of honor because they're pregnant and marrying her ex. But in the story, she says she couldn't even go to the wedding. So maybe she's declining both attending and being the maid of honor. That's a bigger issue. If she's going to refuse to attend, that might be more hurtful to Tammy. \n\nBut the user's question is specifically about the maid of honor role. The title says she doesn't want to be the maid of honor because they're pregnant and marrying her ex. The story then says she told Tammy she can't be around her and not go to the wedding. So she's declining both. But the main question is about the maid of honor. However, she's also not attending the wedding. Is she in the wrong for that?\n\nThe user's answer is A (author is in the wrong) or B (not). The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know. \n\nSo, from my perspective, the author is hurt and needs time to process. However, declining the role and the wedding might be a personal choice, but since she's the best friend, maybe she should try to attend for Tammy's sake, even if it's painful. But if she's too hurt, maybe it's understandable. However, not attending a best friend's wedding could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if Tammy wanted her there. But the key here is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor. Since the maid of honor role is a big deal, but the author is emotionally unable to handle it, maybe she's not in the wrong. But the user thinks she is. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author should try to move past her hurt for her friend. But the situation is complicated. The author's feelings are valid. So maybe B is correct because she's not in the wrong for not wanting to take on the role due to her emotional state. However, if she's not attending the wedding at all, that's a different matter. But the question is specifically about the maid of honor role. So answer B.\n"
