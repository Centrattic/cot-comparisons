Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor for her best friend who is getting married to the author's ex. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has been best friends with Tammy since childhood. They're very close. Then there's Gregory, the author's ex, who they had a complicated on-again-off-again relationship with. The author never really communicated a long-term plan with Gregory, and he moved away. Tammy, the best friend, moved to a city near Gregory and started hanging out with him, which the author encouraged by suggesting Tammy connect with Gregory's friends. \n\nThen, Gregory stopped texting the author, which the author didn't take as a big deal at the time. Later, Tammy reveals she's pregnant with Gregory's baby and they're getting married. The author is hurt and doesn't want to be the maid of honor or even attend the wedding. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they're hurt because the two people they love (Tammy and Gregory) are now together, and they feel like they can't handle being around them. They acknowledge that Gregory and Tammy are a better match and that the situation is perfect for them. But the author is emotionally struggling.\n\nI need to consider if the author is being selfish or if it's reasonable to feel this way. The key points here are the author's emotional response and their right to set boundaries. The author hasn't been in a long-term committed relationship with Gregory; it was on-again-off-again without clear commitment. Tammy approached the author to connect with Gregory's friends, so the author might not have foreseen this outcome. \n\nThe author's refusal to be the maid of honor could be seen as understandable because they're grieving the loss of both the relationship and the friendship. However, since Tammy is the best friend, there's an expectation of support. But the author isn't refusing to attend the wedding entirely but rather taking a step back from being a part of the wedding planning, which is a significant role. \n\nIs it the author's fault? The author didn't prevent Tammy from seeing Gregory, and the relationship happened despite the author's prior connection to Gregory. The author is now dealing with the emotional fallout. It's a complex situation where the author's feelings are valid, but the refusal to participate in the wedding ceremony might be seen as cutting off a close friend, which could be hurtful. \n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. If the author is allowed to prioritize their emotional well-being and set boundaries after being hurt, then they aren't in the wrong. However, if the author is expected to support their best friend despite the personal pain, then maybe they are. But the author's response is about their feelings, which are legitimate. They might need time to process before deciding, but they've already said they can't be the maid of honor. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong because they're dealing with personal hurt and choosing their mental health, even if it means not participating in the wedding. It's a tough situation, but the author's feelings are valid.\n"
