Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor at her best friend's wedding because the friend is pregnant and marrying her ex. The situation is complex.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationships and the context. The author is close friends with Tammy, her best friend since childhood. Then there's Gregory, her ex, who she had an on-again-off-again relationship with. The author introduced Tammy to Gregory, thinking he could help her make friends. Tammy got pregnant with Gregory's baby, and they're getting married. The author is hurt and doesn't want to be part of the wedding party.\n\nThe key points here are the emotional impact on the author and whether she's in the wrong for declining the role. The author is clearly hurt because the two people who were important to her in different ways are now together. She's not mad at Tammy but is sad and can't bring herself to participate in the wedding.\n\nNow, considering the social norms around being a maid of honor. Typically, the maid of honor is the bride's closest friend or a family member, and it's a role the bride wants to give. The author was Tammy's first choice, but the author feels unable to take on that role due to emotional distress. \n\nIs the author obligated to be the maid of honor just because she was asked? Not necessarily. The maid of honor role can be declined if someone isn't comfortable. The fact that the author is struggling with the emotional aspect is valid. She's not being selfish; she's trying to process her feelings. \n\nThe other aspect is the ex-boyfriend angle. The author had a complicated relationship with Gregory, and now he's moving forward with Tammy. The author's reaction is about her own feelings, not necessarily about Tammy and Gregory. The author might feel like she's been replaced or that her past was overlooked.\n\nHowever, the question is whether the author is wrong for declining. In many cases, people understand that such a role requires the person to be supportive and present. If the author isn't emotionally able to do that, it's reasonable to step back. The key is whether the author is being cruel or just honest about her feelings. \n\nThe author did try to keep her cool but couldn't. She also communicated her inability to participate. There's no indication that she's trying to sabotage Tammy's wedding or being vindictive. She's genuinely hurt, which is a valid emotional response. \n\nSo, based on this analysis, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The situation is complicated, and the author's feelings are understandable given the circumstances. She's not being inconsiderate but is prioritizing her emotional well-being.\n"
