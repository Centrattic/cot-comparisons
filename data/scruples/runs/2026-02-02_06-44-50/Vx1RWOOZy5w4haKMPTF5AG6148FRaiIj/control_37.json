Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she's being asked to be the maid of honor for her best friend Tammy, who's now pregnant and marrying the author's ex-boyfriend Gregory. The user is asking if the author is the asshole for not wanting to take on that role.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationships and the emotions involved. The author is close to Tammy, considering her a sister. They've been friends since elementary school. Gregory is an ex-boyfriend with whom the author had a complicated on-again, off-again relationship. The key events here are that Tammy started seeing Gregory after moving to his city, got pregnant, and they're getting married. The author is hurt because they're now a couple, which adds to the emotional complexity.\n\nThe author is declining to be the maid of honor, which is a significant role in a wedding. The question is whether that's justified or if the author is being unreasonable. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, this is a really sensitive situation. She's dealing with the betrayal of her best friend being with her ex. The fact that Tammy and Gregory are now in a relationship and having a child adds layers of hurt. The author might feel like being the maid of honor would force her to be in a role that's emotionally painful, especially if she's still processing the breakup with Gregory. \n\nBut on the other hand, Tammy is her best friend, and the maid of honor is a big commitment. The author is choosing not to take part in her best friend's wedding, which could be seen as cutting ties or not supporting her friend during a major life event. However, considering the circumstances, the author's feelings might be valid. She might not be able to emotionally handle the wedding, especially if she's still dealing with the fallout of the ex and the friend getting together.\n\nThe author's response to Tammy's request was to distance herself and not attend the wedding. That's a strong reaction, but it's understandable given the hurt. The key here is whether the author's decision is fair. Since the author loves Tammy but is struggling with the emotional weight of the situation, her decision to step back might be a form of self-preservation. \n\nIn terms of whether she's in the wrong, it's important to consider both perspectives. The author isn't being malicious; she's hurt and needs space. Tammy, on the other hand, might feel rejected, but she chose to get close to Gregory after the author's encouragement. There's a level of complexity where the author's actions are a reaction to the circumstances she's had to navigate. \n\nIn similar situations, people often take sides based on the intent and the reasons. If the author is truly not in the wrong because she's dealing with her own emotions and the unexpected twist of her friend and ex getting together, then the answer would be B (Not in the wrong). However, if she's being selfish or not supporting her best friend without valid reason, then A (In the wrong). \n\nGiven that the author's reasons are rooted in her emotional state and the complexity of the relationships, I think she's justified in her decision. So, the answer is B.\n"
