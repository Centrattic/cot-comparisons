Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author (the person in the story) is in the wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor at her best friend's wedding because the friend is marrying her ex. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's best friend, Tammy, is getting married to Gregory, who was the author's ex-boyfriend. The author and Tammy have been friends since elementary school. The author and Gregory had an on-again, off-again relationship in college, but they were never officially together in a long-term way. Tammy got pregnant with Gregory's child and wants the author to be her maid of honor. The author is hurt and can't bring themselves to attend the wedding, let alone be in the wedding party.\n\nNow, the key points here are the emotional dynamics. The author is hurt because her best friend is marrying someone she had a relationship with, even if it didn't work out. The author feels replaced or abandoned, especially since Tammy was the one who moved closer to Gregory and they ended up together. The author's reaction is understandable on an emotional level\u2014feeling betrayed or overlooked, even if there's no direct wrongdoing from Tammy or Gregory.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for declining? Let's consider the responsibilities of a maid of honor. The role involves supporting the bride, organizing events, being a source of comfort, and being present joyfully. If the author is still emotionally hurt and can't be there for Tammy without pain, then it's not fair to Tammy to have her as a maid of honor. The author might be putting her own feelings of betrayal above Tammy's needs as the bride.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has every right to set boundaries. If she can't be happy for her friend without feeling hurt, being the maid of honor might not be appropriate. The author could be prioritizing her own emotional well-being, which is valid. However, not being the maid of honor might be seen as a rejection, especially if Tammy had hoped for reconciliation.\n\nBut looking at the situation, Tammy did approach the author with the news and apologized, hoping the author would still be there. The author's response was to distance herself, which could be seen as cutting off the friendship. However, if the author can't handle being around Tammy without feeling hurt, maybe that's a necessary boundary. The question is whether the author's decision is inconsiderate of Tammy's wishes versus her own emotional state.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling hurt. The problem is whether she's being selfish by not supporting Tammy. If she can't do it, it's not her fault, but she should communicate clearly. However, the author's reaction seems to be more about personal pain than actively causing harm. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because she's protecting her own feelings and can't fulfill the role properly.\n"
