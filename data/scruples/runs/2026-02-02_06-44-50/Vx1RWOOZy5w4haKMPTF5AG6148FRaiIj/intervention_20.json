Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor at her best friend's wedding, given that the friend is marrying her ex. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author has been best friends with Tammy since elementary school. They've been through a lot together, so Tammy is like a sister to her. Then there's Gregory, the author's ex-college boyfriend. They had a complicated on-and-off relationship, but they always stayed in touch. The author never really expected Gregory to become a long-term partner, but they had an emotional connection.\n\nThe key event here is that Tammy moved to a city near Gregory, and the author suggested Tammy reach out to him for social connections. Tammy ended up getting pregnant by Gregory, and they're getting married. The author is hurt and can't bring herself to be the maid of honor. She feels like Tammy and Gregory are a better match and that her ex and best friend ending up together is the worst possible outcome. She's struggling with her emotions and the idea of being part of their wedding.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for declining the maid of honor role. Let me consider the possible angles. \n\nFirst, from Tammy's perspective, she's asking her best friend to be the maid of honor, which is a significant role. The author is close to both Tammy and Gregory, but now there's a personal conflict because Gregory is her ex. The author's feelings are hurt because she had a relationship with Gregory and now he's marrying her best friend. \n\nBut does that make her in the wrong? Well, the maid of honor is a role that requires emotional support and being a positive presence at the wedding. If the author is still too hurt and upset, it's understandable that she can't fulfill that role. Being a maid of honor might require being happy for the couple, and if the author can't do that, it could affect the event. \n\nOn the other hand, Tammy might feel betrayed or hurt that her best friend is pulling away. The author did suggest Tammy connect with Gregory, which might have led to their relationship. But the author didn't know at the time that Tammy would end up with Gregory. \n\nThe author's refusal isn't out of spite but genuine emotional distress. She's not being cruel to Tammy; she's just overwhelmed. However, maybe she should have tried to support her friend despite the pain. But if the author isn't in a place where she can be supportive, is it fair to expect her to be the maid of honor?\n\nAlso, considering that Tammy and Gregory are a better match, the author might feel like she's being replaced. But the author's feelings are valid. She's allowed to feel hurt and need space. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author isn't acting out of malice. She's declining because she can't emotionally handle the situation. So maybe she's not in the wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's any aspect where she wronged Tammy. Did she promise to be the maid of honor before knowing? The story says Tammy asked, and the author declined. So she didn't commit earlier. \n\nTherefore, the author's refusal is based on her emotional state and inability to be supportive, which isn't her fault. So answer B.\n"
