Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's best friend Tammy is getting married to the author's ex, Gregory. Tammy is also pregnant with Gregory's child. The author is hurt and doesn't want to be the maid of honor or attend the wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the relationships here. The author is close friends with Tammy, but Gregory was a past romantic partner. The author helped Tammy connect with Gregory, thinking it would help her socially. Now, Tammy is marrying Gregory, and the author feels hurt and doesn't want to be part of the wedding. The question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they're dealing with a lot of emotional pain. They have a long history with Gregory, and now their best friend is marrying someone they used to love. Plus, the author might feel like they were a third wheel or that their help led to this situation. The author's feelings of sadness and wanting distance are valid. They might not be able to support the wedding because of their emotional state.\n\nOn the other hand, Tammy asked the author to be the maid of honor, which is a significant role in a wedding. The author is in a position where their refusal might hurt Tammy, especially since she's already feeling guilty. Tammy might have thought they were still close, and the author's refusal could make Tammy feel rejected. The author might be seen as not supporting their best friend during a big event, which could be hurtful.\n\nBut the author's emotional response seems reasonable. They were blindsided by the news of Tammy and Gregory's relationship and pregnancy. The author's refusal isn't out of malice but because they can't handle the emotional conflict. It's possible that the author isn't in the wrong because they're prioritizing their own well-being. However, the author could have handled the situation more gracefully, maybe by explaining their feelings without being abrupt.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the author's past with Gregory. If the author had no intention of getting back with him, but he was an ex, the author might not have a strong claim here. The author's feelings of betrayal might be more about the friendship and the unexpected turn of events rather than any direct wrongdoing by Tammy. The key point is whether the author's refusal is justified given their emotional state and the circumstances.\n\nIn terms of social expectations, being a maid of honor is a big commitment, and the author is declining because of personal reasons. But since it's a very personal situation involving exes and close friends, it's a bit of a gray area. The author might be in the right because they can't be expected to attend a wedding where the groom is their ex, especially under these circumstances. However, it's also possible that the author is avoiding a necessary step in healing and maintaining the friendship with Tammy.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author's decision is considered selfish or self-protective. If the author is making a choice to protect their mental health, they aren't in the wrong. But if they're being selfish and not considering Tammy's feelings, they might be. The author's feelings are valid, but the way they handled the situation (cutting off Tammy abruptly) could be seen as hurtful. However, given the shock and hurt, the author's reaction is understandable. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
