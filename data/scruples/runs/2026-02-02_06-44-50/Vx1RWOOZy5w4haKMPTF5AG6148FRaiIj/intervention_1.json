Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor for her best friend who's getting married to her ex. \n\nFirst, the author has a close relationship with Tammy, her best friend since childhood. They've been through a lot together. Then there's Gregory, her ex, with whom she had an on-again-off-again relationship. The author introduced Tammy to Gregory, thinking it would help her friend. Now Tammy is pregnant with Gregory's child and they're getting married. The author is hurt and can't bring herself to be the maid of honor, even declining to attend the wedding.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. The author's feelings are valid because she's dealing with a situation where her best friend is marrying her ex. The emotional impact of this can't be ignored. However, the maid of honor role is a significant part of the wedding, often expected to be supportive and involved. The author is declining this role, which the friend might see as a rejection, especially after the friend apologized and tried to maintain the relationship.\n\nBut the author's reasons are rooted in personal pain and the realization that her two closest people are now a couple. It's possible that she's still processing the breakup with Gregory and the betrayal, even if Tammy didn't intentionally cause it. The author's decision to step back is a way to protect herself emotionally. However, by not fulfilling her role, she's causing distress to Tammy, who had planned to have her best friend as maid of honor. \n\nFrom a traditional standpoint, being a maid of honor is a big commitment. If the author can't be supportive due to her feelings, it might be fair for her to step down. However, considering the friendship's history, the author might have an obligation to support Tammy despite her hurt. But given the circumstances\u2014Tammy is carrying Gregory's child and they're getting married\u2014it's a valid reason for the author to need some space and not take on a role that could be emotionally draining and potentially hurtful.\n\nOn the other hand, Tammy might feel abandoned, especially since she apologized and tried to reach out. The author's initial reaction was to pull away, which could be seen as cutting off a friend during a significant life event. But the author's emotional state is also a factor here. She can't force herself to be happy for them if she's still hurting. \n\nSo, the author's decision is understandable from an emotional perspective. However, the role of maid of honor is significant, and backing out might be seen as not honoring the friendship. But if the author can't be present without resentment, it's better to step back than to attend out of obligation. The key is whether the author handled it with consideration for Tammy's feelings. The author did communicate her decision, even if it was difficult, which shows some level of respect. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's actions are hurtful to Tammy, her reasons are personal and valid. She's not in the wrong for prioritizing her emotional well-being, even if it means stepping away from a traditional role. However, the way she handled it could be improved by being more empathetic and possibly offering alternatives, like not being the maid of honor but still attending the wedding to support her friend. But given the situation, she's not necessarily in the wrong.\n"
