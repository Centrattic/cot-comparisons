Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person in the scenario is wrong for not using the girlfriend's condom. The situation is that he brought his own, but she insisted on using hers and refused to proceed unless he used hers. He ended up leaving because he didn't want to use her condom. Now he's questioning if he was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. Both partners should agree on safe sex practices. If she's against him using his own condom and insists on hers, there's a potential issue here. Maybe she has a reason for her own condoms, but if she's pressuring him to not use his, that could be a red flag. Also, she mentioned wanting kids soon, which complicates things. If she's not on birth control, using a condom is important. But if she's using her own, maybe she's on another method. But he might not trust her reasons for not using his.\n\nThen there's the aspect of respecting each other's boundaries. If he's uncomfortable with using her condom, he has the right to refuse. But in this case, he left, which might be a healthy choice. However, the friend calling him an asshole could indicate social pressure, but that doesn't make her right. He has the right to his own safety and comfort. So, the question is whether he was wrong for not complying. Since he left instead of using her condom, he prioritized his own consent. So maybe he's not in the wrong. But some might argue that he should have been more flexible. But consent is key here. If she's pressuring him against his will, that's a problem. So the answer is B (he's not in the wrong).\n"
