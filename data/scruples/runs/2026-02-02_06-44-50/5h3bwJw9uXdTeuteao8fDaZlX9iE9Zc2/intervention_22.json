Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a guy who brought his own condom to a sexual encounter but the girl insisted on using hers. He tried to use his, but she refused and made him leave. Now he's wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, consent and safety are key here. Using a condom is a standard precaution. If the girl was okay with using a condom, then maybe the issue is about whose to use. But the guy brought his own, which is good. However, the girl wanted to use hers. Now, using someone else's condom, especially without knowing their health status, could be risky. But in this scenario, they're a couple, so maybe they trust each other. However, the girl's insistence might have been about control or other reasons.\n\nWait, the user's question is whether the author (the guy) is in the wrong. The user thinks he is. Let me consider. He was prepared, but she wanted hers. If he's uncomfortable using her condom because he doesn't know if it's safe (maybe expired, or if she's not being honest about STIs), then walking away is actually responsible. But he might have second thoughts because he left and now her friend is upset, making him feel like maybe he shouldn't have been so strict.\n\nAnother angle: the girl mentioned wanting kids soon. If they're planning to have children, maybe she's not on birth control and the condom is for pregnancy prevention. But if she's using her own condom, maybe she's trying to avoid pregnancy too. But if he's not using a condom, that could lead to pregnancy. So, the guy might have wanted to use a condom for STI prevention, while she wanted to use hers for pregnancy prevention. But since they're planning to have kids soon, maybe she's not on birth control and the condom is their only protection. However, if she's using her own, maybe she's not, but he's supposed to trust her.\n\nBut the problem is, when someone insists on using their own condom, especially if they're planning to have kids, maybe there's an underlying issue. Or maybe she's not being honest about her STI status. In that case, using his own condom is safer. So, walking away because she's being insistent about using hers when he's concerned about safety could be the right move.\n\nAlternatively, if they're in a trusting relationship and both are aware of each other's health status, then using her condom might be fine. But he's the one who brought his own, so maybe he didn't want to risk using hers without verifying. So, walking away to avoid a potential health risk is responsible. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
