Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong. He went over to his girlfriend, they were going to have sex, and he brought a condom. She didn't want him to use his, insisted on using hers, and even said he couldn't go through with it unless he used hers. He refused and left. Now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation clearly. The key points are: the woman wanted to use her own condom, the man had already brought his, but she insisted on hers. She's also mentioned wanting kids soon, but maybe thought they'd just \"mess around\" a bit first. He was scared, left, and now her friend called him an asshole. He's second-guessing his decision.\n\nNow, considering the context, using a condom is a standard practice for safe sex. Both parties should agree on the method of protection. The woman's insistence on using her own condom could be for various reasons\u2014maybe she prefers a specific brand, wants to ensure she has control over the situation, or there's something else. But the man bringing his own isn't inherently wrong. However, when she says she won't proceed unless he uses hers, that's a point of contention.\n\nIn a consensual relationship, both partners should have a mutual agreement on such matters. If the woman is insistent and the man refuses, is that a problem? It depends on the circumstances. If she's pressuring him to use her condom and he's concerned about her possible STI status or other reasons, then his refusal might be justified. But if they are in a trusting relationship where both are using protection consistently, maybe her insistence is about control rather than safety.\n\nThe author's main concern is that he might have been wrong to refuse. But why would he be in the wrong? If the situation is that she's in a hurry to conceive (as she mentioned wanting kids soon), maybe using a condom at all is conflicting. However, if they are not ready for pregnancy, condoms are necessary. If she's saying she wants to use her own, perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, she might be testing his boundaries or asserting control.\n\nAnother angle: the author brought his own condom. If she's okay with using a condom but wants to use hers, he could have agreed. However, if he's concerned about her not using a condom at all (maybe she's trying to get pregnant), then he's right to insist. But she's the one who mentioned wanting kids soon, so maybe she's not opposed to condoms for now. Wait, that's conflicting. If she wants to have kids soon, why use a condom? Maybe she's on birth control and wants to ensure protection, or maybe there's a misunderstanding. The author thought that maybe they'd just \"mess around for a week or two and that'd be it\"\u2014so maybe he thought they'd not use a condom, but she's more cautious.\n\nThe problem arises when she's insistent on using her own. If the author is in a relationship where mutual trust exists regarding STIs, maybe using her condom is safe. But if he's not sure about her STI status, refusing to use his own could be a safety measure. However, if she's pressuring him to use hers and he refuses, perhaps he's overstepping, especially if they are in a committed relationship where such decisions are mutual.\n\nThe friend calling him an asshole might indicate that using her condom is the expected social norm, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's wrong. The key is consent and mutual agreement. If she's pressuring him and he's uncomfortable, he has the right to say no. But if the situation is that they agreed to use condoms and she's providing hers, then he's being stubborn. However, the author's hesitation and fear might indicate he felt pressured, and leaving was his way of asserting his boundaries.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a matter of mutual consent. If she's not willing to compromise and he's not willing to use her condom, then there's a conflict. However, if there's a risk involved (like STIs) that he's trying to protect himself from, then he's in the right. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the relationship is supposed to be trusting and they're both using protection, maybe he should have gone along. But without knowing her STI status, his refusal is understandable. However, since he's the one who brought up the condom, and she's offering hers, maybe he's being inflexible.\n\nSo, considering all angles, if the woman is in a committed relationship with him and they are both using protection, then using her condom is acceptable. If he's concerned about her STI status, he has the right to refuse. But if there's mutual trust, then he might be wrong to refuse. The situation is a bit ambiguous. However, the fact that she said she wouldn't let him proceed unless he uses hers is a form of pressure. In that case, if he's uncomfortable with that pressure, he's not in the wrong for leaving. But if the pressure is a normal part of their relationship dynamics and he's being stubborn, then he might be in the wrong.\n\nGiven the information, the author's actions were based on his own comfort level and possibly a desire to protect himself. Since the woman is the one pressuring him to use her condom and he refuses, it's a matter of personal boundaries. If the relationship is healthy, they should discuss such issues before engaging in intimacy. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, if the relationship is supposed to be consensual and they had agreed on using condoms, then he might be in the wrong for not following through. But given that he brought his own and she insisted on hers, maybe the core issue is their agreement on protection methods. If they hadn't discussed it before, his action is justified. The answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he's standing by his own preparedness and boundaries."
