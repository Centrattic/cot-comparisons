Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is at fault for not using his girlfriend's condom when she insisted. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the user brought his own condom, which is responsible. The girl said they should use hers and wouldn't proceed if he used his. The user then left, but his girlfriend's friend is upset. The user is now doubting his decision.\n\nSo, what's the key point here? Consent and safety. Using protection is important for both parties. The girl wants to use her own condom, maybe because of trust or preference. But the user had his own prepared. If she's insistent and even threatening not to proceed unless he uses hers, that's a power dynamic. However, the user is within his rights to prefer using his own condom. But if she's adamant and he leaves, is that wrong?\n\nWait, the user left when she said she wouldn't proceed unless he used hers. That's about respecting boundaries. If she's not comfortable with his condom, maybe she's not comfortable proceeding. Alternatively, he might have been within his rights to stand his ground, but if she's insistent and he leaves, maybe he's being too rigid. But using a condom is a mutual decision. If she's insistent and even threatening rejection, that's a form of pressure. However, he had the right to refuse. But then again, if she's not willing to proceed unless he uses hers, maybe he should comply for the sake of mutual comfort. But the user says she mentioned wanting kids soon, which complicates things. Maybe she's on birth control? But the user might be concerned about STIs. If she's not on birth control, using her condom would still prevent pregnancy but maybe he's worried about STIs. Wait, but if they're in a monogamous relationship, maybe he doesn't need to worry. But the user might not be sure about her STI status. \n\nSo, the user's main issue is whether he was wrong for not complying. The key factors are mutual consent and health safety. If she's insistent and he leaves, maybe he's being cautious. However, if she's not willing to proceed unless he uses hers, that's her boundary. The user might be in the wrong if he refuses to use her condom when she's clear about her needs. But if he's uncomfortable with her condom, maybe he should have discussed it. Alternatively, if she's pressuring him to use hers, that's a red flag. \n\nIn the end, the user left when she said to, which might be a good choice because he shouldn't feel pressured. But if she's not using protection and he's concerned about STIs, that's a problem. However, in this case, he used his own, but she wanted hers. If she's okay with her own being used, maybe the issue is about control. But the user is being honest about his preference. So, maybe the user isn't in the wrong because he's respecting his own boundaries. However, the girl's friend is upset, implying maybe the user's actions were unnecessary. The answer might hinge on whether using the provided condom was necessary for her comfort and if he should compromise. But if he's not willing to use hers, maybe he's being inflexible. Alternatively, if he's not convinced about her health status, he's right to use his own. But if she's in a monogamous relationship and on birth control, maybe the issue is different. \n\nI think the user is not in the wrong because he had his own prepared and didn't want to use hers for valid reasons, like STI concerns. Leaving was his right. So the answer is B (No, he's not wrong).\n"
