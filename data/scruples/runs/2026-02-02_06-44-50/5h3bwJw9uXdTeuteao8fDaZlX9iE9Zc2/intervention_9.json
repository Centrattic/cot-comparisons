Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about not using their girlfriend's condom instead of their own.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author had a condom with them, but the girlfriend insisted on using hers. He mentions she wanted to have kids soon, which might imply she wants to become pregnant, so maybe she doesn't want to use a condom to get pregnant. But he was prepared with his own, and she refused. She even said he should leave if he didn't use hers. Then her friend called him an asshole.\n\nThe user thinks the author is wrong but wants my opinion. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no).\n\nLet me break this down. Consent and mutual agreement are crucial in any sexual activity. Both partners should have a say in birth control and STI prevention. If the girl wants to use her own condom, maybe she trusts her own or has her reasons. But the author had his own, which he brought for a reason. However, she might be trying to conceive, so using a condom would prevent that. But the author might not have wanted to get her pregnant and thus insists on using his own.\n\nIs there a right or wrong here? It depends on communication and respect. If both sides discussed their preferences beforehand, that's better. But in this case, she insisted, and he walked out. Is that his right? If he's not comfortable with her decision, then walking out is his choice. But is he in the wrong for not using her condom?\n\nWait, maybe the issue is about safety. If the author is concerned about STIs, using his own condom is important. If the girl is not on birth control and wants to get pregnant, but the author isn't ready, there's a conflict. However, the problem here is that the author didn't use a condom at all. Wait, no\u2014he brought his own, but she wouldn't let him use it. So he didn't use any? Or did he use hers? No, he walked out. So he didn't proceed. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not using her condom when he had his own.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the woman is in the wrong for pressuring him to use hers when he had his own. But if she's trying to get pregnant, maybe she wants to avoid the condom. But the author might not be ready for kids. So there's a mismatch in their intentions. If they didn't discuss this beforehand, maybe that's the problem. The author might be wrong for not using hers if she wanted to conceive, but he might be right if he's not ready. However, the actual act didn't happen because he left. So the main issue is about consent and compromise.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both should communicate their needs. If the author was prepared with a condom, it shows he's responsible. But the girl's insistence without prior discussion might be an issue. However, the author's refusal to use hers could also be a problem. It's a bit of a gray area. The friend calling him an asshole might indicate societal expectations, but that's subjective.\n\nIn sexual ethics, both partners should have autonomy. If the author felt that using his own condom was necessary for his safety, he has the right to insist. However, if the girl is trying to conceive, using a condom would contradict that. So there's a conflict. But the author didn't use any, so maybe he's not wrong for leaving if he wasn't comfortable. Alternatively, if the girl's refusal is due to wanting to get pregnant, but the author isn't ready, then he's not wrong for not proceeding. But the question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong for not using her condom. If he had his own, maybe he should have used his instead of hers, but she wouldn't let him. So he walked out. Is that wrong? Maybe not, if he's not willing to proceed without a condom. It depends on the context of their relationship and prior discussions.\n\nBut the user's take is that the author is wrong. Maybe because he didn't respect her choice? However, if the author has valid reasons (like STI protection), he's not wrong. But if the main issue is about her wanting to get pregnant and him not wanting to, then he's not wrong for not proceeding. Alternatively, if they should have discussed this before, then both are responsible. The answer might be that it's a situation where communication was lacking, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for walking out if he wasn't comfortable. Therefore, answer B.\n"
