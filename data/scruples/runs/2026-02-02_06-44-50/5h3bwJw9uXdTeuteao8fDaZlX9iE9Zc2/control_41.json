Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who brought his own condom, but the girlfriend insisted on using hers because she wants to get pregnant soon. He was confused, thought maybe she wanted to have kids in a couple of months, but she became insistent and even made him leave when he refused. Now he's wondering if he was wrong to stand his ground.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The girl mentioned wanting kids soon, which might mean she's not on birth control and wants to get pregnant. If she's trying to conceive, using a condom would prevent pregnancy. But she told him to use hers instead. Maybe she wanted to use a specific brand or type, or perhaps there's a misunderstanding about her actual intentions. \n\nThe author brought his own condom, which is a common practice for safety. He tried to use it, but she refused. He was scared and left. But then her friend called him an asshole. The question is about whether he was wrong in not using her condom.\n\nFrom a health and safety perspective, using a condom is important for STI prevention. If she's not on birth control and wants to conceive, then she shouldn't be using a condom if her goal is pregnancy. However, if she's not on birth control and they're trying to conceive, then not using a condom would make sense. But the problem here is that she's insisting on using her own condom, which seems contradictory to her stated goal. \n\nWait, maybe there's a misunderstanding. If she wants to get pregnant soon, using a condom would prevent pregnancy. So if she's actually trying to conceive, she wouldn't want to use a condom. But she's telling him to use hers, which is confusing. That might be a red flag. Maybe she's not being honest about her intentions, or perhaps she's using the condoms for another reason, like STI prevention. \n\nThe author's right to use his own condom is important. Both partners should feel comfortable about the method of protection. If she's not comfortable with his condom, maybe they should discuss it more. But in this case, she was insistent and even made him leave. The author chose to leave, which could be seen as standing up for his own boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, if she mentioned wanting kids soon, maybe she's not on birth control and wants to get pregnant. So using a condom would be against that goal. But if she's not on birth control and insists on using a condom, that's confusing. There might be a communication issue here. \n\nThe author's actions could be considered not wrong because he had the right to use the condom he brought. However, if she's not on birth control and wants to get pregnant, using a condom would prevent pregnancy. So there's a contradiction. The author might be right in wanting to use his own condom for safety, but if the goal is pregnancy, then using a condom is counterproductive. \n\nAlternatively, maybe she's using the condoms for another reason, like STI protection. But if she's not on birth control, that implies she's not using any other form of birth control. So the use of a condom would be necessary for both pregnancy and STI prevention. But if she wants to get pregnant, she wouldn't want to use a condom. \n\nThis situation is confusing. The author's decision to leave might be seen as standing up for his own needs, but if she's actually not planning to use the condom, maybe he's missing something. However, the key point is that they should both agree on the method of protection. If she's insistent on using her own condom, perhaps there's a reason she didn't communicate clearly. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both partners should discuss and agree on birth control methods. If the girl is insistent on using her own condom despite wanting to get pregnant, that's a problem. The author's actions might be justified if he feels uncomfortable using her condom. But if she's not using birth control and wants to conceive, then using a condom would be against that. \n\nSo, in conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong because he had the right to bring his own condom and insisted on using it. However, the situation is complicated by her wanting to get pregnant soon. If she's not using birth control and wants to conceive, using a condom is contradictory. Therefore, there might be a communication breakdown. The author's actions could be seen as standing up for his own boundaries, which is valid. But if she's actually not using birth control and wants to get pregnant, then the condom use is unnecessary. The confusion here might be hers, not his. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
