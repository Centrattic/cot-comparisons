Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author of this story is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who brought his own condom, but his girlfriend insisted on using hers, and when he refused, she wouldn't proceed. He ended up leaving, and now he's wondering if he made the right choice.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The guy had his own condom ready, but the girl said they should use hers. He was okay with using a condom but wanted to use his own. She became insistent and even said he should leave if he didn't use hers. The guy then left, and there was some backlash from her friend.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. The user thinks he is, but wants others' opinions. Let's consider consent and mutual agreement here. Using a condom is a mutual decision. If the woman is uncomfortable with the guy's condom for any reason, maybe she has a valid concern. But in this case, she's insisting on using hers, and the guy is okay with using a condom in general but not hers. That creates a conflict.\n\nWait, but why would she be so insistent on her own condom? Maybe she has specific reasons, like her own brand, or she's more comfortable with hers. However, the guy was prepared with his own. But the problem here is that the woman is making the decision, and the guy is refusing to comply. In a consensual situation, both parties should agree on the terms. If one party insists on a condition that the other isn't willing to meet, that could be a problem for consent.\n\nBut here's the catch: the guy was willing to use a condom, just not hers. The woman wanted her own. The guy's stance is that he's not going to use hers. The woman is saying no sex unless he uses hers. So, the guy's choice to leave might be seen as standing by his own preference, but the woman is enforcing her condition. \n\nHowever, in terms of consent, if one person is not willing to proceed unless the other uses their condom, and the other person refuses, that could be a situation where there's no mutual agreement. The guy's decision to walk away might be his right, but if the woman is pressuring him, is that his fault? \n\nBut wait, the woman mentioned that she wants to have kids soon. Maybe the insistence on using her own condom is because she's using it for tracking or other reasons. The guy didn't consider that and just refused, which could be a problem. Maybe he should have been more open to using hers, given her stated plans. \n\nOn the other hand, he had his own prepared, and he might have concerns about her condom's quality or her reasons for wanting to use hers. But in a trusting relationship, both should be able to use each other's condoms if they're okay with it. However, the woman's insistence to the point of threatening to end the encounter might be her overstepping, but the guy's refusal could also be his way of standing his ground. \n\nBut consent isn't about one person getting their way over the other. If the woman is not willing to proceed unless he uses hers, and he's not willing to, then neither is in the wrong for having their own preferences. However, the fact that he left and she called him an asshole complicates things. Maybe the fault is on the woman for pressuring him beyond his comfort, but he's also not at fault for not using hers. \n\nAlternatively, since he was okay with using a condom, but not hers, maybe he's in the wrong for not considering her preference. If she's okay with using a condom, but prefers her own, he should respect that. If he can't, then maybe he's not respecting her boundaries. But he's also within his rights to prefer his own. \n\nHmm. This is a bit of a gray area. The key question is whether refusing to use her condom is a dealbreaker. If the woman is insistent, and he's not willing to comply, then maybe he's in the wrong for not giving in, especially if her reasons are valid (like wanting to track her cycle for pregnancy). However, if he's uncomfortable with using her condom for any reason, that's his right too. \n\nBut the main issue is mutual consent. If one is not willing to proceed unless the other uses their condom, and the other is not willing to, then neither is in the wrong for their stance. However, the woman's insistence to the point of being confrontational might make her at fault for pressuring him. But the guy's refusal might be his right. \n\nIn terms of consent, both need to agree. If he's not willing to use hers, she can't force him. So maybe the guy is not in the wrong for leaving, as he's refusing to do something he's uncomfortable with. However, if she's using the condom for tracking, maybe he's supposed to respect that. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the guy's refusal is valid. Since he's okay with using a condom, the fact that he's just not willing to use hers might be his choice, but if she's not okay with that, she can choose not to proceed. So neither is necessarily in the wrong. But the context of her wanting kids soon might influence this. If she's using her own condom for tracking, he should use hers. If he's not willing, he's not respecting her needs. \n\nAlternatively, maybe he's not in the wrong because he's prepared his own and is sticking to it. The woman might have known he had condoms and should have expressed her preference earlier. \n\nThis is tricky. The user thinks the author is at fault, but I'm not sure. The answer might be A or B. But based on mutual consent and preferences, maybe both are right in their own ways. However, in the context of wanting to use her own for tracking, maybe the guy should have been more flexible. So maybe A is the answer.\n"
