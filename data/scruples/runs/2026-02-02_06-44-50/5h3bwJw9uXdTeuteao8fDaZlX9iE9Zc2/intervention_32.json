Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy went over to his girlfriend, and they were going to have sex. He brought his own condom, but she insisted on using hers instead. He initially refused, then she said she wouldn't have sex with him unless he used hers. He left, and now he's wondering if he did the wrong thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. Condom use is a personal choice and a health/safety issue. Both parties should agree on which condom to use. The guy had his own, but she wanted hers. Maybe she has a preference, or maybe there's a reason she brought her own. But forcing someone to use a specific condom could be an issue if it's not a mutual decision. However, in this case, she said she wouldn't proceed unless he used hers. That seems like a non-negotiable demand. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's more context. The girl mentioned wanting kids soon. If she's planning to get pregnant, using a condom would prevent pregnancy. So maybe she was trying to have unprotected sex to get pregnant earlier. But the guy didn't want that, so he brought his own. If that's the case, the guy was trying to prevent pregnancy, and she wanted to have unprotected sex. So he's standing his ground on using a condom, which is his right. But the problem is, she's refusing to proceed unless he uses hers. That might be a form of pressuring him to have unprotected sex, which could be a red flag. \n\nCondoms are a shared responsibility. It's generally a good idea to use one that both parties are comfortable with. If she's insistent on using hers, maybe she has a reason\u2014like maybe she's concerned about his condom being expired, or maybe it's a brand she trusts. But if she's forcing him to use hers, that might be an issue. Also, the fact that she said he might as well leave if he didn't use hers sounds like coercion. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy brought his own, so he's responsible for his own protection. If she's insistent, maybe he should compromise and use hers, but he might not trust her or the situation. But if she's pressuring him to use hers, that could be a sign of disrespect. Condom use is a personal choice, and neither party should feel forced to use a specific one. \n\nThe friend texting him an asshole might have a point if the guy is being stubborn. Alternatively, if the guy is standing by his decision for safety, maybe he's right. But in relationships, communication is key. Maybe they should have discussed this beforehand. The fact that she mentioned wanting kids soon but then insists on using her condom (which would prevent pregnancy) is conflicting. That might indicate she's not ready for kids yet but wants to have unprotected sex, which is confusing. \n\nSo, the guy's actions could be seen as standing up for his boundaries regarding safe sex, or as being inflexible. If he's genuinely concerned about STIs or pregnancy, using a condom is responsible. But if she's insistent on hers, maybe there's an underlying issue. The key point is mutual consent and agreement on contraceptive use. If she's pressuring him to use hers without mutual agreement, that's a problem. However, if he's willing to use hers but just wants to use his own, that's his choice. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The guy is not wrong for wanting to use his own condom. However, walking out might be an overreaction. Maybe he should have discussed it more calmly. But the fact that she threatened to leave if he didn't comply is a form of coercion. So, the author might not be in the wrong, but the situation shows poor communication on both sides.\n"
