Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a guy who brought his own condom to a sexual encounter with his girlfriend, but she insisted on using hers. He ended up not using a condom because she wouldn't let him use his, and he left. Now, the question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the basics of consent and sexual health. Using a condom is a personal choice and a health precaution. Both partners should be comfortable with the method of protection they use. The key here is that the guy wanted to use his own condom, which is a standard practice for safety. The girlfriend, however, wanted to use hers. \n\nBut here's the thing: when it comes to condoms, it's generally recommended that one person uses their own. If he wanted to use his, but she wanted to use hers, there's a potential conflict. Using someone else's condom can be a risk if there's any doubt about where it's been or if there's been pre-ejaculate on it. However, in this case, she's the one providing it, so maybe she's trusted. But the guy is concerned about using hers because of that. \n\nThe woman mentioned she wants kids soon. That's a bit confusing because using a condom would prevent pregnancy. Maybe she's not ready for pregnancy yet but was okay with using her condom for other reasons, like STI protection. However, the guy doesn't mention STIs being a concern. \n\nThe main issue here is mutual consent on the method of protection. If she insisted he use hers, but he was uncomfortable and left instead of compromising, who's at fault? The problem is that he didn't compromise. He had his own, she had hers, but he didn't want to use hers. She made him leave if he didn't use hers. So he left. \n\nIn terms of rights, the guy has the right to use his own condom for his safety. The girl has the right to set boundaries. However, if she's not willing to use his, but he's not willing to use hers, then the situation is a stalemate. The guy chose to leave, which is his right, but the girlfriend's friend called him an asshole. That might not be fair if the guy was just trying to protect himself. \n\nBut wait, did the guy have a right to insist on using his own? If the girl is the one providing the condom, maybe he shouldn't use his. But if he's uncomfortable with using hers, he's within his rights to not proceed. However, the way he left after she said to leave if he didn't use hers might be seen as not respecting her decision. But he wasn't using his own, so he might have been trying to protect himself. \n\nAlternatively, maybe he should've compromised. If she wanted to use hers, maybe he should've respected her choice, especially if she's the one providing it. However, there's a health aspect here. If he's concerned about using hers because of the possibility of STIs, that's valid. But if the relationship is monogamous and they both tested, then maybe not. \n\nIn summary, both had valid points. The guy wanted to use his own for his safety, but the girl wanted hers. He left, which could be seen as not respecting her boundaries, but he was also protecting his own. However, since he left instead of negotiating, maybe he's in the wrong? Or maybe she's in the wrong for insisting he use hers. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whose rights take precedence: the guy's right to use his own condom or the girl's right to set the terms. \n\nI think the key here is that using a condom is a shared responsibility. If one person brings their own, but the other insists on using theirs, there's a conflict. The guy should have communicated his concerns more effectively. Maybe he should have discussed why he wanted to use his own, like STI concerns, instead of just leaving. But the girl's friend calling him an asshole might be overreacting. \n\nIn the end, if the guy left because he wasn't comfortable using hers, he's not necessarily in the wrong. However, if he had already agreed to use hers and then backed out, that's different. But in the scenario, he brought his own, she insisted on hers, and he left. So maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the girl was firm and he didn't compromise, maybe he is. Hmm.\n"
