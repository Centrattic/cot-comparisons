Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about a condom disagreement between him and his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the author went to his girlfriend's place with his own condom. They were about to have sex, and she insisted on using hers instead. He initially wanted to use his, but she became persistent and even said he had to leave if he didn't use hers. Then her friend called him an asshole for not going along with her. The author is now unsure if he made a mistake.\n\nSo, the main issue here is consent and control over reproductive health. Condoms are a form of contraception, and if the woman is the one who would be affected by pregnancy, she might have a legitimate reason to want to use her own method. The author had a condom, but she wanted to use hers. Maybe she had her own reasons: perhaps her condoms are preferred, or maybe she wanted to ensure they were using her preferred method, or maybe she's not comfortable with his. \n\nBut the author left the situation because he didn't want to use hers. Now, the question is whether that was the wrong move. In relationships, communication is key. If the girlfriend wanted to use her own condom, maybe she should have explained her reasoning. However, the author also has the right to express his preferences. But when she said he couldn't have sex unless he used hers, that's a form of pressure or even coercion. Consent must be mutual and enthusiastic. If she's making it a deal-breaker, that's problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might not be considering the risk of pregnancy. If she mentioned wanting kids soon, maybe she's less concerned about pregnancy, but if he's not ready, using her condom might be a better way to prevent unintended pregnancy. However, the author didn't mention his own stance on pregnancy or why he wanted to use his condom. Maybe he trusted her, or had another reason. \n\nBut the fact that she made it a condition to leave, and then her friend called him an asshole, complicates things. The author's action was to leave, which is his right, but if she's the one who would face the consequences of pregnancy, he has a responsibility to respect her wishes. However, if he's uncomfortable with her condom, he should have communicated that instead of just leaving. \n\nWait, the user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess. The key points are: mutual consent, reproductive autonomy, and communication. If the girlfriend is the one who would be at risk, he should prioritize her method. However, she should also be open to discussion. The author didn't compromise; he just left. Her friend's judgment might not be fair, but the author's choice to leave might have been his right if he felt uncomfortable. However, the girlfriend's insistence could be overbearing. \n\nBut using a condom is a shared responsibility. If he had his own, it's reasonable to expect that he could have used his, but she wanted hers. If she's pressuring him to use hers, maybe she's asserting control, which isn't healthy. Alternatively, if he's not willing to use hers, maybe he's being rigid. \n\nI think the author made a mistake by leaving because he should have communicated and found a solution. If she was unwilling to use his, and he was uncomfortable with hers, maybe they could have discussed other forms of contraception or not proceeded. But his decision to leave because of a condom preference might not be the best approach. However, the girlfriend's behavior in making it a deal-breaker could also be wrong. \n\nBut in terms of responsibility, the author should have considered the risk he's imposing on his girlfriend. If she's not on contraception, using her condom would prevent pregnancy. By not using it, he's not respecting her reproductive choices. So maybe he's in the wrong for not using hers when she wanted to.\n"
