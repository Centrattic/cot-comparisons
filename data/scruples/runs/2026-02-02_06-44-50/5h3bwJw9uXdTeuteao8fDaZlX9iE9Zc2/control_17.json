Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend who insists on using her own condom instead of the one the guy brought over. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The man brought his own condom, but the woman refused and insisted on using hers. She even threatened to end the encounter if he didn't comply. The man left, and now he's being criticized by her friend. The question is whether the man was wrong for not using her condom.\n\nSo, considering consent and autonomy. Using a condom is a mutual decision. If one partner is uncomfortable with the other's method, it's a red flag. The woman's insistence might indicate control or a lack of trust. However, the man left when she wouldn't allow his choice, which could be seen as standing up for his own comfort. \n\nWait, but why would she need her own condom? If she's the one using it, maybe there's an issue with trust or hidden reasons. Also, she mentioned wanting kids soon, which might complicate things. If they're planning to have kids, maybe she wanted to avoid using a condom but found a way to assert control. But the man was prepared, so he didn't want to risk pregnancy or STIs without his own method. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both should communicate openly. If she was okay with using her own, maybe that's her choice, but he had the right to use his. However, if she was pressuring him to use hers, that could be a problem. The key is mutual agreement. If he felt pressured and left, maybe he was in the right to prioritize his own safety and comfort. \n\nAnother angle: using someone else's condom might not be safe. If he didn't trust her to provide a new one, that's a valid concern. However, if she was willing to use hers, and he had no reason to doubt its safety, maybe it's a matter of mutual trust. But the fact that she was so insistent and controlling might mean she overstepped. \n\nSo, the man left because he was uncomfortable. In that case, maybe he's in the right for not complying with her demands when it conflicted with his own preparedness. However, if the woman was just expressing a preference and he left, maybe that's being too rigid. But given her insistence and the threat to end the encounter, his choice to leave could be seen as standing up for his own boundaries. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong. But I need to make sure. The main points are mutual decision-making and consent. If she was pressuring him and he left, he's prioritizing his own comfort and safety, which is reasonable.\n"
