Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about not using the girlfriend's condom and ending up not having sex. The writer brought his own condom, but she insisted on using hers and even threatened to leave if he didn't. Then her friend called him an asshole for not going along.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The writer had his own condom, which is responsible. The girl wanted to use hers and was firm about it. He thought she wanted to use a condom for protection, maybe against pregnancy. She mentioned wanting kids soon, which might imply she's not on birth control or wants to track fertility. But if she's using a condom, maybe she's not on other methods.\n\nNow, the argument is about who's right. Condoms are a shared responsibility, but in this case, the woman is asserting her preference. The writer was okay with using a condom but wanted to use his own. She was insistent. He chose to not comply and left. Her friend is upset with him, but is he wrong?\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, respecting each other's boundaries is important. If she's uncomfortable using his condom, maybe there's a reason. Maybe she's not on birth control, so using her own is her way of ensuring pregnancy isn't a risk. Or she might prefer her brand for comfort. The writer, however, might be more concerned about STI protection, which condoms also provide. But since she's not on birth control, maybe she's on something else, and using her condom is part of her method.\n\nBut the main issue is consent and mutual agreement. If she's okay with the condom but wants to use hers, he should respect that. Refusing and then leaving could be seen as not respecting her wishes. Also, the fact that she wanted kids soon but still wanted to use a condom might indicate she's not ready for that yet, so her insistence might be about contraception despite the desire to conceive in the future. Maybe she's using a different method for now but wants to avoid pregnancy for a while.\n\nThe writer's reasoning is that he was scared, maybe because he didn't want to use her condom. Is that valid? If they were both in agreement on using a condom, the brand shouldn't matter. If he's not willing to use her condom, even if it's the same type, that could be a problem. It might be about control or not trusting her. But since she's the one who's more insistent, he should comply unless there's a valid reason not to. If he can't trust her, then maybe the relationship isn't healthy. Alternatively, if there's a misunderstanding about her fertility plans, that's a communication issue.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, if the woman is clear about her boundaries and the man refuses to comply, leading to her not wanting to proceed, then he might be in the wrong. However, bringing up his own prepared condom shows he's responsible. But not using hers when she insists could be a breach of her consent. So the answer might be that he's in the wrong because he didn't respect her choice, even if it's a minor issue. Alternatively, if there's a lack of communication about her fertility intentions versus actual contraceptive needs, that's a separate problem, but in the moment, he should follow her lead if she's firm.\n"
