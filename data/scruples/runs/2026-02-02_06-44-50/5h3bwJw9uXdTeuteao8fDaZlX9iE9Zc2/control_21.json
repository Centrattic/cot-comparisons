Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who brought his own condom to a sexual encounter with his girlfriend, but she insisted on using hers. He went ahead and used his own, but she refused and made him leave. Now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and safety. The girlfriend mentioned she wants to have kids soon, which might mean she's not on birth control or doesn't want to use another method. But she insisted on using her own condom. However, the guy had his own and wanted to use that. \n\nWait, but the key here is that the woman is refusing to use his condom and is making it a deal-breaker. If someone is pressuring another person to use their own condom, that could be an issue if the other person is uncomfortable. However, in this case, the guy had already brought his own, which is responsible. The woman's insistence might be about control or maybe she has a specific reason for her preference. \n\nBut from a safety standpoint, using any condom is better than none. However, if the woman is pressuring him to use her condom and he's using his own, but she refuses the encounter, maybe there's a power dynamic. Wait, but the guy is the one who is using his own, which is his right. However, if the woman is not comfortable with him using his own, then perhaps there's a communication issue. \n\nWait, but the user says that the woman mentioned wanting kids soon. If she wants to get pregnant, maybe she's not using any protection. But if she's using her own condom, maybe she's trying to have protected sex. So he brings his own, but she wants to use hers. But why does she care which one is used? Maybe she has a reason for her preference. \n\nHowever, the main point here is consent. If she is refusing to proceed unless he uses her condom, but he's okay with using his own, then he's not in the wrong for standing by his own choice. But if she's pressuring him to use hers and he's not comfortable, but he uses hers anyway, that's a different scenario. \n\nIn this case, the guy has his own, which is correct. He's not forcing her to use his. She's refusing to proceed unless he uses hers. So by not complying, he leaves. But maybe the problem is that she's trying to control the situation. Alternatively, if she's not on birth control and wants to avoid pregnancy, using a condom is necessary. But if he's not on PrEP or anything, using a condom is for both protection. \n\nThe key here is mutual consent. If she's not comfortable with his condom, maybe there's an issue. But he's not wrong for using his own. However, if she's pressuring him to use hers, but he's not willing, then he's in the right. But in this case, he had already brought his own. She's now insisting on hers. So he used his own, she refused. He left. \n\nBut maybe the problem is that he didn't consider her reason. If she wanted to use her own for a reason, like maybe she had a specific method or trust issues. Alternatively, maybe she's trying to control the situation. \n\nBut in terms of right or wrong, the guy is in the right for bringing his own condom and not using hers if he's not comfortable. However, if she's pressuring him to use hers and he's not willing, then he's not wrong to leave. So the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's any ethical or societal norms that would consider him wrong. \n\nIn some perspectives, if you're in a relationship and someone brings their own condom, maybe it's a red flag if there's a lack of trust. But the user is in a relationship where they're considering having kids soon. Maybe the woman is not on birth control and is trying to avoid pregnancy but wants to use her own condoms. The guy, bringing his own, is responsible. However, if she's not comfortable with his condom, maybe there's a deeper issue. But the guy's action of using his own is not wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
