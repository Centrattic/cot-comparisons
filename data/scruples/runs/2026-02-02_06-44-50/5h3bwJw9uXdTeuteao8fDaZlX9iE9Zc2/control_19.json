Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not using his girlfriend's condom when she insisted on using hers. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the situation. The author had brought his own condom, but the girl refused to use it and insisted on using hers. He refused, left, and now there's some tension because her friend called him an asshole. He's wondering if he made the right decision.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and safety. Condoms are a personal choice in terms of which one to use, but the main thing is that both parties agree on using a condom. If someone refuses to use a condom altogether, that's a problem, but here the issue is about whose condom to use.\n\nIn terms of STI prevention, it doesn't matter whose condom you use, as long as it's used correctly. So, the girl's insistence on using her own might be about preference or maybe she's more comfortable with her own. However, the author had already prepared his, so there's no issue of not using one. \n\nNow, the girl mentioned she wants kids soon. If they're not ready for pregnancy, using a condom is important. But if she's on birth control or they're okay with the risk, maybe that's a separate discussion. However, the scenario says she wanted to use her condom, so they were both agreeing to use one. \n\nThe problem here is that they disagree on whose to use. The author chose his, she chose hers. He left when she wouldn't let him use his. Is that wrong? Well, in terms of mutual consent, if she's okay with using any condom, then the specific brand or whose it is shouldn't matter. But if she's insistent on hers for a reason (maybe she's used to it, or it's a personal preference), then maybe the author should respect that. But if the issue is about safety or trust, then it's different.\n\nHowever, the author's actions led to conflict. Her friend calling him an asshole suggests that maybe his refusal was seen as disrespectful. Also, the fact that she said he might as well leave if he didn't use hers shows she was firm. The author might have overreacted by leaving. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the core issue is consent and compromise. Both should be willing to meet halfway. Since the author left instead of trying to find a middle ground, maybe he's at fault. Also, the initial preparation of his own condom shows he was responsible, but the conflict arose from whose to use. \n\nAnother angle: if the condom itself is the point, then using either is fine. If the problem is about control or dominance, that's different. The girl's insistence might be controlling, but the author's refusal could be standing his ground. However, in a healthy relationship, communication and compromise are key. \n\nGiven that, the author might be in the wrong for not being flexible. Alternatively, if the girl was being unreasonable, maybe not. But since the question is about right or wrong, and given that both had the intention to use a condom, the issue is about whose to use. The correct answer would hinge on whether using the other's condom is a dealbreaker. Since the author left, maybe he's not in the wrong for prioritizing his own preparedness, but the situation could have been resolved with communication. However, the fact that he left and caused a conflict might make him at least partially responsible for the tension. \n\nSo, the answer could be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't compromise. Or B (No) because using either condom is acceptable. But considering that both wanted to use a condom, the specific one might not matter. The author's refusal to use hers could be seen as rigid, causing unnecessary conflict. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
