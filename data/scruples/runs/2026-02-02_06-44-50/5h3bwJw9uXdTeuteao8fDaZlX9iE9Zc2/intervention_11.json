Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a disagreement over which condom to use.\n\nFirst, the guy brought his own condom, but the girl insisted on using hers. He tried to use his, but she refused and even threatened to end the encounter if he didn't use hers. He ended up leaving. Now he's wondering if he was wrong to not use her condom.\n\nI need to consider consent and autonomy here. Both parties have the right to make decisions about their bodies and sexual health. Using a condom is a mutual decision, and both should agree on its use. The girl's insistence might be about her own preferences, maybe she prefers her brand or has medical reasons. However, she shouldn't force him to use hers if he's uncomfortable. On the other hand, the guy had his own, so why did he bring his own if he was okay using hers? Maybe he felt it was safer, or maybe he just wanted to be prepared. If she was so insistent and made him leave, maybe she's in the wrong for pressuring him. But the guy's choice to leave might be his way of maintaining his boundaries. However, if the issue was about her wanting to use her own condom, which is her right too, then maybe he's in the wrong for not respecting her choice. Wait, but he had his own, so maybe she was being controlling. But maybe she had a reason to use hers, like maybe she already had it, or she wanted to use a specific type. The problem is, both have the right to their own preferences, but it's important to communicate and agree. If she refused to proceed unless he used hers, that could be seen as manipulative or controlling. The guy's decision to leave could be his way of standing up for himself. However, if he was okay with using hers, maybe he should have complied. But the story says he was scared and left. The key point is mutual consent on the use of contraception. If both agreed to use a condom, then either one's should be fine. If she insisted on hers, maybe she had a reason, but he was uncomfortable. In that case, he's not wrong for not using hers. Alternatively, if she's the one who initially said \"no need\" and later changed her mind, that could complicate things. Wait, in the story, she said \"no no, there's no need, I have some\" when he tried to use his. So maybe she wanted to use hers, but he had already brought his. So he tried to use his, but she wanted to use hers. Then she got persistent and said he had to use hers. So she was changing her mind or being inconsistent. If she initially said she had some, maybe she wanted to use hers, but when he tried to use his, she changed her mind. That could be confusing. But in any case, both have the right to their own preferences. However, if she made it a non-negotiable issue, that's where the problem is. The guy left because she was pressuring him. So maybe he's not wrong to leave. The friend calling him an asshole complicates it. Maybe she was trying to assert control, which isn't healthy. In a healthy relationship, both should agree on the use of contraception. The guy's mistake might be not discussing this beforehand. He brought his own, maybe assuming she wouldn't have any. But if she did, maybe he should have considered that. However, if she insisted on hers, he had a right to refuse. So overall, maybe the author isn't wrong for leaving. But if the issue was about her not wanting to use a condom initially but later insisting, that's a red flag. Wait, the story says she mentioned wanting kids soon but thought they'd mess around for a week or two. Maybe she wanted to use her own condom to plan for possible pregnancy, but the guy was confused. If she's trying to get pregnant, using a condom would prevent that. Wait, maybe she wanted to use her own condom to prevent pregnancy, but if she wants kids soon, using a condom would be counterproductive. That's conflicting. Maybe the story has inconsistencies. The guy might have misunderstood her intentions. But regardless, the core issue is consent and mutual agreement. If she pressured him to use her condom, which he didn't want to, he's in the right to leave. So maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
