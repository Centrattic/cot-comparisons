Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a man who brought his own condom, but the woman insisted on using hers, even to the point of threatening to end the encounter. He left, and now he's being called an asshole by her friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the basics of safe sex and consent. Condoms are important for preventing STIs and unintended pregnancies. The woman mentioned wanting kids soon, but that might be a red flag if she's pressuring him to not use a condom. However, her insistence on using her own could be about her control over the situation, maybe she's on birth control or trusts her own condoms more? But she might be hiding something, like an STI, which is why she's pushing for her own. \n\nThe man had his own condom, which is responsible. But when she refused to let him use his, he had to choose between complying with her request or leaving. Using her condom might have been a way to move forward, but if he's uncomfortable with that, leaving could be the right choice. However, the key point is whether refusing to use her condom is a form of sexual coercion. If she's pressuring him to use her condom against his will, that's a problem. But in this case, she's the one who's not allowing him to use his own. He's the one who's trying to use protection, and she's making it conditional.\n\nAlso, the fact that she mentioned wanting kids soon but then is pressuring him to use her condom might be conflicting. If she's using her own condoms, maybe she's not ready to conceive yet, which contradicts her earlier statement. That could be a sign of mixed signals. \n\nThe man left, which is his right if he's uncomfortable. But then her friend called him an asshole, which complicates things. The man's choice to leave might be seen as standing up for his boundaries, but the woman's insistence could be seen as controlling. \n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong: If the woman is pressuring him to use her condom, which he's not comfortable with, and he leaves to avoid compromising his safety, then maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if using her condom is a mutual agreement and he's refusing without a valid reason (like her STI status being unknown), then he might be in the wrong. But since he had his own, maybe he's just being cautious. \n\nBut the main issue is consent and mutual agreement on safer sex. If they didn't agree on using a condom, and she's making it a condition, then she's pressuring him, which is a form of sexual coercion. The man's choice to leave because he wasn't comfortable with her condom might be justified, especially if he can't verify her reasons. \n\nSo considering all that, the man might not be in the wrong for prioritizing his safety and leaving. The woman's behavior could be controlling or hiding something. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
