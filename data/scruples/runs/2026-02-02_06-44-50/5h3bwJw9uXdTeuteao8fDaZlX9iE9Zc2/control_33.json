Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person went to his girlfriend's place, brought a condom, and tried to use it. But the girlfriend insisted on using hers, and even said not to have sex unless he uses hers. He ended up leaving, and now he's wondering if he did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to think about consent and mutual agreement. In any sexual situation, both partners should be comfortable and agree on the terms. The author mentions that the girlfriend wanted to have kids soon, so maybe she's on birth control? But even if that's the case, using her own condom might be a way for her to have control over the situation. \n\nBut why did he bring his own condom in the first place? He was prepared, which is good. However, the girlfriend might have different preferences or health reasons for using her own. Maybe she has a specific type of condom she's comfortable with, or perhaps there's an issue with the one he brought. The problem here is that he insisted on using his own, and she was firm in her refusal. \n\nWhen she said she wouldn't let him unless he used hers, that's a clear boundary. The author then decided to leave, which seems like a good choice because he's respecting her boundary. But the friend called him an asshole, which complicates things. Maybe the girlfriend was in the wrong by making such a demand, but the author also has a responsibility to communicate why he brought a condom in the first place. \n\nWait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are mutual consent and respecting each other's boundaries. If the girlfriend is okay with not using a condom because she's on birth control or wants to conceive, then maybe the author overreacted. However, if the girlfriend insisted on using a condom and not his, perhaps there's a reason related to safety or personal preference. \n\nBut the author's reasoning is that he was scared. Maybe he felt like she was pressuring him into a risky situation, or perhaps there's a lack of communication. He might have thought she was on birth control but she wasn't, or vice versa. The fact that she mentioned wanting kids soon might mean that she's not on birth control, so using a condom is necessary. If the author was okay with using her condom, maybe he should have. But since he was insistent on using his own, and she refused, leaving was a respectful choice. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author should have communicated better and not taken it as an ultimatum. Insisting on using his own condom when she's clearly set a boundary might be seen as not respecting her wishes. But then again, if he felt uncomfortable using hers, that's his right. The problem is that the situation escalated to an argument, and he left, which could be seen as a reasonable decision. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he had used her condom, maybe he would have been respectful of her wishes. But if he had a legitimate reason to bring his own, like trusting only his own, then he might not be at fault. The girlfriend's insistence to the point of an ultimatum might be the issue. But the author made a choice to leave, which is a good sign he respects her boundaries. \n\nI think the answer here is that the author is not in the wrong because he respected her boundary by not using his condom and left when she was insistent. However, there's a lack of communication on both sides. The girlfriend may have a right to her own preferences, and the author should have discussed why he brought a condom. But in the situation, he didn't push further and left, which is a responsible action. So the answer is B for No.\n"
