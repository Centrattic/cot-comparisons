Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about using a condom. The guy brought his own, but the girl insisted on using hers. He didn't want to, so he left. Now he's questioning his decision because her friend called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girl mentioned wanting to have kids soon, which might relate to her not wanting to use a condom. But maybe she's on birth control? If she's not, then using a condom is important to prevent pregnancy. However, the guy had his own, but she wanted to use hers. \n\nThe main ethical issue here is consent and mutual agreement. Both parties should agree on the method of protection. If the girl is pressuring him to use her condom, but he's not comfortable with that, he has the right to refuse. On the other hand, if she insists on using her own for a reason (like she's not on birth control), then not using any protection could be risky.\n\nThe guy left because she wouldn't let him use his own. Was that the right move? Well, he was respecting his own boundaries. However, by leaving, he might have caused a conflict. But if the girl was non-negotiable and he wasn't willing to comply, walking away is a valid choice. \n\nAnother angle is her mention of wanting kids soon. If she's not on birth control, using her own condom would mean he's the one responsible for the birth control method. Maybe she wanted to use her own for her own reasons, but the guy's bringing his own was a precaution. If she's not on birth control, not using a condom would risk pregnancy. But if he's not on board with using hers, then he's not responsible for the protection. \n\nThe friend calling him an asshole suggests that maybe the girl's side of the story is that he was being stubborn. But the guy's right to set boundaries is important. The problem is that in a situation where both parties aren't on the same page, communication is key. They should have discussed this beforehand. \n\nIs he in the wrong? If the girl was pressuring him to use her condom and he was uncomfortable, then he's not in the wrong for leaving. However, if the girl's insistence was based on her own health or contraceptive needs, then he might have a responsibility to comply if he's part of a committed relationship. But since they've only been talking for 3-4 weeks, maybe it's not that serious yet. \n\nIn terms of ethics, consent and mutual agreement are crucial. If the guy is uncomfortable with using her condom, he's within his rights to refuse. However, the girl's refusal to use his condom might be based on her own reasons. It's a gray area. But the guy didn't force her; he left. The friend's reaction might be biased. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because he respected his own boundaries and walked away instead of compromising his comfort. But if the girl's refusal to use his condom put her at risk of pregnancy, then maybe he's partially responsible. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, not about the girl's actions.\n"
