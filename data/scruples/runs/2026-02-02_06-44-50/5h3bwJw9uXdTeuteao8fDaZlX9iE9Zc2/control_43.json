Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy and his girlfriend (or a girl he's been dating for 3-4 weeks) and a condom issue.\n\nSo the guy brings his own condom, but the girl insists on using hers. He's confused, maybe a bit scared, and leaves. Then her friend texts him calling him an asshole. The guy is now questioning if he should have gone along with her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and autonomy in relationships. Using a condom is a personal choice. If the girl is refusing to use the guy's condom and insists on hers, maybe there are reasons like health concerns or personal preference. However, the guy had his own, which is a good practice. But if the girl is insistent and he backs out, does that make him wrong? Or is he within his rights to choose his own method of protection?\n\nWait, but the girl mentioned wanting kids soon. Maybe she's not on birth control or maybe she's using the condom as a way to avoid pregnancy but wants to conceive later. But she's pushing to use her own, so maybe she has a specific reason. But the guy had his own, and she's refusing. Is that a red flag? Like, maybe she's trying to control the situation, or maybe she's not on birth control and wants to get pregnant, but he's not ready?\n\nIn terms of consent, both should agree on the method of protection. If she's pressuring him to use hers and he refuses, leading to him leaving, is that his right? Or is he violating her wishes? Also, if she's saying she won't proceed unless he uses her condom, and he leaves, that's his choice. But if the friend is calling him an asshole, maybe there's a social pressure issue.\n\nBut the key here is mutual consent. If the girl is refusing to proceed unless he uses her condom, and he's uncomfortable with that, he's within his rights to not proceed. However, if she's pressuring him and he leaves, is that okay? Or is he being inflexible?\n\nWait, but the user says it's his girlfriend. So maybe there's an expectation of compromise. If she's insistent on using her own, maybe he should have respected that. But he had his own, and she's overriding that. Maybe the issue is about respecting each other's boundaries. If he's uncomfortable with using hers, he can mention health concerns. Alternatively, maybe she has her own reasons for using hers, like maybe it's a brand she prefers or she has STI concerns and wants to ensure her own are used.\n\nBut the guy's reasoning is that he's scared and leaves. The friend's reaction is negative. The question is whether the guy is in the wrong. If the girl is pressuring him to use her condom and he refuses, leading to him walking out, is that justified? Or is he being disrespectful because he didn't agree to her terms?\n\nIn terms of consent and sexual health, both parties should have agency. If the guy had his own condom and she's refusing, maybe she's trying to exert control. However, if he's not comfortable using hers, he has the right to leave. But the situation is a bit ambiguous. The girl's insistence might be a red flag, but the guy's choice to leave could be seen as respecting his boundaries. However, the friend calling him an asshole suggests that maybe in the context of their relationship, using hers was expected, and he overreacted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the girl was trying to make a point about using protection, but the guy's reaction was too extreme. So it's a bit of a toss-up. But in terms of being wrong, if he walked out because he refused to use hers, maybe he's in the right if he had health concerns or felt pressured. But if there's no health issue, maybe he's being too rigid. But since the girl mentioned wanting kids soon, maybe she's trying to get pregnant and wants to avoid using a condom. However, if he's not ready for that, he's in the right to back out.\n\nBut the user is asking if he's in the wrong. The answer depends on whether using her condom was a mutual decision. Since he had his own, and she's insistent, maybe she's trying to take control. But if he's uncomfortable with that, leaving is his choice. However, the friend's reaction suggests that maybe the girl's side of the story isn't being considered here. Maybe the guy is missing something. But given the information, he might not be in the wrong for walking out if he felt pressured and had his own prepared.\n"
