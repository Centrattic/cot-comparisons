Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he went over to his girlfriend and planned to use his own condom. She insisted on using hers instead, and when he didn't comply, she made him leave. Now he's wondering if he was wrong to not use her condom.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the basic principles of sexual health and consent. Condoms are important for preventing STIs and unintended pregnancies. When someone brings their own condom, they might have specific reasons related to trust, safety, or personal preference. But in this case, the girl mentioned wanting kids soon, which might imply she doesn't want to use a condom. However, the author's main concern here is that he was prepared with his own, but she wouldn't let him use it, leading to the situation where they didn't engage in intercourse because he refused to use hers.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is at fault. From a health perspective, using a condom is a responsible choice. If the girl is against using any condom, that's a red flag for STI risks. But the author had his own, and she didn't want him to use it. That's a bit confusing. Why would she not want him to use his own? Maybe because she trusts her own, or maybe she doesn't want to use a condom at all. If she's planning to get pregnant soon, maybe she's not using a condom now because she wants to conceive, but that's risky if there's a chance of STIs.\n\nThe author's decision to leave when she insisted on using her own might be seen as standing his ground on using protection. But if the relationship is serious and they plan to have children, maybe using a condom isn't necessary for pregnancy prevention, but STI risks remain. The key here is mutual consent and trust. If the author trusts her STI status and she's on birth control or another method, then maybe not using a condom is okay. But if there's any doubt, using a condom is the safer option.\n\nThe girl's friend calling him an asshole might be because she didn't like his refusal. But the author's priority was his own safety. If he's not ready to not use a condom, walking out is a valid choice. However, if the girl is insistent on using hers, maybe there's an underlying issue. Maybe she's not using protection because she's not on birth control, or she's not honest about her STI status.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't wrong for choosing to use a condom. It's his responsibility to protect himself. If she's against using any, that's a problem. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's taking responsibility for his health and safety. The girl's insistence without clear reasons could be a red flag. However, if they are in a committed relationship where STIs aren't a concern, maybe not using a condom is okay, but the author's choice to leave is his right.\n"
