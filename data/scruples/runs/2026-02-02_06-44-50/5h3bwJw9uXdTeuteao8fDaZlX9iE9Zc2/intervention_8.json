Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not using his girlfriend's condom. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the guy went over to see a girl he's been talking to for 3-4 weeks. They were about to have sex, and he brought his own condom. But the girl said no, they should use hers, and she wouldn't proceed unless they used hers. He was confused, thought she mentioned wanting kids soon, but maybe he misunderstood. He refused to use her condom, got scared, and left. Then her friend texts him calling him an asshole. He's now questioning if he should have gone along.\n\nNow, the user is asking if he's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nHmm. Let's consider consent and communication. Both partners should agree on contraception and STI prevention. If the girl insisted on using her own condom, maybe there's a reason. But the guy had his own, which is safe. Maybe the issue is about control or trust. If she's pressuring him to use her condom instead of his, is that a red flag? Or maybe she just wants to be in control of the situation. \n\nAnother angle: the guy might not have considered her reasons for preferring her own condoms. Maybe she has STIs and didn't want to share, or maybe she's concerned about pregnancy but didn't want to use a condom. But if they were going to have sex, using a condom is standard. If he's not comfortable with her condom, maybe he should have discussed it before. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend mentioned wanting kids soon. If she's taking birth control, maybe she's not on it yet, so the condom is necessary. But if she's on birth control, maybe she's not using condoms, but the guy might not trust that. Alternatively, maybe she wants to get pregnant, but that seems odd if they're only been together a few weeks. \n\nThe key here is mutual consent. If the girl is pressuring him to use her condom, and he's not willing, maybe he's not respecting her boundaries. But if he's uncomfortable with using her condom because of STI risks, that's a valid concern. However, if they're in a committed relationship where they trust each other, maybe the main issue is about who brings the condom, not the actual protection. \n\nIn some contexts, if one partner insists on using a condom and the other refuses, that's a problem. But in this case, both are using a condom, just the source. So the guy is using a condom, which is good. The issue is who provides it. \n\nIf the girl is insistent and the guy refuses, maybe he's not respecting her wishes. But if he has his own and she's being controlling, that's another side. It's a bit of a toss-up. \n\nIn terms of health and safety, using any condom is better than none. But the guy might be uncomfortable with using hers if he's unsure of her STI status. However, since they're in a relationship, maybe that's not the case. \n\nSo, the guy's actions led to him leaving, causing tension. The friend calling him an asshole suggests the girl's side is that he was being difficult. \n\nI think the main point is that both should communicate. The guy might have been in the wrong by not discussing her reasons before refusing. Instead of arguing, he should have asked why she preferred hers. Alternatively, the girl might be being controlling. \n\nBut given the scenario, the guy did bring a condom, which is responsible. The girl's insistence might be about control. So maybe the guy isn't in the wrong. But if she had valid reasons (like STIs) and he's ignoring that, then he's wrong. But the info isn't clear. \n\nSince the question is whether he's in the wrong, and considering that both used a condom, maybe the guy's choice is okay. However, if the girl's refusal to use his own condom is a form of control, then the guy's refusal to comply might be justified. \n\nBut maybe the issue is that he didn't respect her preference. If she wanted to use her own, maybe he should have gone along. So answer A or B?\n\nHmm. I think the answer depends on context. Since they're in a relationship and she's pressuring him, but he's bringing his own, maybe the guy is not wrong for using his own. But the problem is she wouldn't let him use his. If he's not willing to use hers, maybe he's being difficult. \n\nAlternatively, if she has a valid reason for needing to use hers, then he's wrong. But without more info, maybe the guy is not in the wrong because he's using a condom, which is good. The conflict is about who provides it. \n\nSo perhaps the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he's using a condom, which is responsible, even if they had a disagreement. But if she had a reason he didn't consider, it could be different. But based on the given info, maybe B.\n"
