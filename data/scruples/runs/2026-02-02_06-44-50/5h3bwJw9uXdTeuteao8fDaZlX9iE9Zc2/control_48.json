Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who brought his own condom to a sexual encounter, but his girlfriend insisted on using hers and wouldn't let him proceed otherwise. He ended up leaving because he was uncomfortable, and her friend called him an asshole. Now he's wondering if he did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The woman mentioned she wants to have kids soon, which might mean she's using her own condoms for something specific, like tracking her cycle or maybe they're fertility-friendly. But the guy had his own, so he was prepared. The woman refused to let him use his, even when he was ready. Then she said if he didn't use hers, he should leave. He did leave, and now he's questioning himself.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. Both partners should discuss their preferences and boundaries. If she wanted to use her own condom, maybe there's a reason, like medical, or she prefers a certain type. But the guy had already brought his own, so maybe there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nThe guy's actions: he tried to use his condom, which is a responsible move. The woman refused and made it a deal-breaker. The guy left, which shows he respected his own boundaries. But some might argue that respecting the partner's wishes is important too. However, using a condom is a personal health and safety issue. So if he felt uncomfortable using hers (maybe he's allergic to latex, or they're of different types), forcing him to use her condom could be a problem.\n\nAnother angle: the woman's insistence might be about control or safety. If she's the one who wants to get pregnant soon, maybe she's using her own condoms properly, but that doesn't make sense because if they're using condoms, she's not trying to get pregnant. Wait, but the user mentioned she said \"there's no need, I have some\" when he brought his own. That might mean she's on birth control or another method. However, the woman later said she wants to have kids soon, so maybe she's not using any method and wants to track ovulation with her own condoms? That seems odd. Maybe she's using non-latex or something else for medical reasons.\n\nThe guy left because he was scared and uncomfortable. That's a valid reaction if he felt pressured. The friend's reaction might be adding to the pressure. The question is whether the guy was wrong for not using her condom. If she's the one who wanted to use her own, but he felt it was important to use his, and he left to honor his own boundaries, he might not be in the wrong. However, if the woman's insistence was a deal-breaker for her, and he left instead of negotiating, maybe he's being too rigid. But since it's about safe sex, it's a personal choice. So the guy isn't in the wrong for prioritizing his own comfort and safety, especially if he had no reason to trust her STI status or if they're in a new relationship. Alternatively, if they're in a monogamous relationship and trust each other, maybe he should be more flexible. But the user mentioned they've been dating 3-4 weeks, so maybe trust isn't fully established yet.\n\nIn terms of consent and autonomy, both have the right to set boundaries. The woman's refusal to let him use his own condom could be a red flag if she's forcing him into a situation against his will. However, the guy left, which is a good choice, but the friend's reaction (calling him an asshole) might indicate that the woman's side of the story is different. The friend might think the guy was being difficult over something trivial. But without more context, it's hard to say. The guy's actions seem respectful of his own boundaries, so he's not in the wrong. The answer would be B, No.\n"
