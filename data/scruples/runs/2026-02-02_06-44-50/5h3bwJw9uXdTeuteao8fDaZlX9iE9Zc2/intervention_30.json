Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is wrong for not using his girlfriend's condom. So the scenario is that he brought his own condom, but she insisted on using hers, and when he didn't comply, she refused to go further and made him leave. Now he's conflicted, wondering if he was right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. Condom use is a personal choice between partners, right? But there's also the aspect of mutual consent and communication. The man had his own condom, which he probably trusted, but the woman wanted to use hers. He didn't want to use hers, maybe for reasons of trust, or maybe he's just used to his own. But why did she care so much about using hers?\n\nWait, she mentioned wanting to have kids soon. Hmm. That's an interesting point. If she wants to have children in the near future, maybe using a condom at all would prevent that. But she said she wanted kids \"soon,\" like in two months, but thought they would \"mess around for a week or two.\" So maybe she's not ready for pregnancy yet but is open to trying. But if she's using a condom, that would prevent pregnancy. That seems contradictory. So maybe she's not actually trying to get pregnant yet, but wants to have sex without a condom to possibly conceive, but she's not ready for that yet. Or maybe there's another reason she's pushing for her condom.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she had a specific reason to use her own, like she doesn't trust his storage conditions for the condom, or maybe she prefers a different type. But the man is the one who brought his own, so maybe he's the one who's more cautious. But when one partner insists on using a specific method, the other should respect that if they want to maintain the relationship.\n\nBut wait, the man didn't use her condom and left. The woman then made things awkward with her friend. So the question is, was the man wrong in not complying with her request? Let's break down consent and autonomy. In a sexual relationship, both partners need to agree on safety measures. If she's insisting on using her condom, and he's not willing to, that's a conflict. But why would she need to use her own? If she wants to become pregnant, then using a condom would prevent that. So maybe she's not ready to have children yet, but wants to have sex without a condom. But if he's not on board with that, then he's not in the wrong for not wanting to risk pregnancy. Wait, but the user says she mentioned wanting kids soon, so maybe using a condom contradicts that. So if she wants to get pregnant soon, then using a condom would not help. So why would she insist on using her own condom? That seems confusing. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Perhaps she actually wants to avoid pregnancy but still insists on using her own condom, maybe because she wants to have control over the situation. Or maybe she's not ready for unprotected sex yet, but wants to use her own for some reason.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she's trying to pressure him into having unprotected sex so that they can get pregnant. If that's the case, then the man is right to be cautious. However, if she wants to use her own condom for safety reasons, like she brought a specific type or she's concerned about his, then he should respect that. But the main issue here is mutual agreement. If she's pressuring him to use her condom, and he's not comfortable, then he has the right to say no. However, the fact that she said she wouldn't proceed unless he used hers might indicate that she's not actually okay with his choice. In that case, he's not wrong for not complying if he's not comfortable. But the problem arises when one partner insists on a condition for sexual activity, which can be a form of pressure or even coercion if it's not genuinely consensual.\n\nAnother angle is the health aspect. Using a condom is important for STI prevention. If they're not in a monogamous relationship or if there's any risk of STIs, using a condom is necessary. If the man is bringing his own, but she's not comfortable using his, maybe she has a reason related to that. But he's the one who's prepared, so he's taking the initiative. However, if she insists on using hers, he should consider her needs. But if he's not comfortable with that, he can't be forced into using her condom. But in this case, she's making it a deal-breaker. So is that her right to set that boundary?\n\nIn terms of consent, both partners need to agree on the terms. If he's not willing to use her condom, and she's not willing to proceed without it, then they both have valid boundaries. The man's choice not to use her condom isn't inherently wrong if he has reasons, but if she's not okay with his choice, then proceeding without mutual agreement isn't appropriate. However, the man is the one who chose to leave, which shows he respected her boundary by not engaging in the act she conditioned on his using her condom. So in that case, he's not wrong for not using her condom if he's not comfortable, but he might be wrong if he's not considering her reasons. But given the confusion about her wanting to have kids soon, maybe she's not actually ready for unprotected sex, so using a condom would be appropriate. If she wants to have kids soon, then using a condom would prevent that, so maybe she wants to have unprotected sex but is using the condom as a way to control the situation. However, if the man is not ready for pregnancy, then he's right to insist on a condom. But there's a miscommunication here. The key is mutual consent and understanding each other's needs. If she's pushing for her own condom, but he's not willing, then the man is not wrong for leaving, especially if he's not comfortable. However, the fact that he had his own brings up the question of why she insisted on hers. Maybe she's not aware of the implications of using a condom if she wants to have kids soon. If she wants to get pregnant in two months, using a condom would prevent that. So maybe there's a misunderstanding. The man thought she wanted to avoid pregnancy, but she actually wants to get pregnant, which is conflicting. So if she's insistent on using her condom, but that would prevent pregnancy, perhaps there's a deeper issue here. The man might be wrong if he's not considering her actual desire to conceive, but if he's not ready for that, then he's within his rights to want to use a condom. However, the way she's presenting it as a deal-breaker is problematic because she's making a condition for sex that the other partner isn't comfortable with. So in that case, the man isn't wrong for not complying if he's not okay with her condition. But the woman's behavior might be more in the wrong for pressuring him into a situation where using a condom would prevent pregnancy if that's her goal. This is a bit of a tangled situation. The main point is that both partners need to communicate their needs and boundaries. If she's not willing to have sex unless he uses her condom, and he's not willing to, then neither is wrong for their respective choices. But the man's choice to leave shows he's respecting her boundary by not engaging in the act she conditioned on his using her condom. So he's not wrong for not using his own, but he might be wrong if he's not considering her actual needs. However, given the confusion about her desire to have kids, it's possible she's not ready for pregnancy, but wants to have sex without a condom, which the man is cautious about. In that case, he's in the right for not using her condom if he's not comfortable. So overall, the answer might be that he's not in the wrong.\n"
