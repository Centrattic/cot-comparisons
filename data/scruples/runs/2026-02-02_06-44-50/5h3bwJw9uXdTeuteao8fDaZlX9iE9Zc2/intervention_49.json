Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about using a condom. The user went to his girlfriend, they were going to have sex, and he had a Trojan (which is a brand of condoms) that he brought. When he tried to use it, she refused and insisted on using her own. He says she got persistent, even to the point of saying he should leave if he didn't use hers. Then her friend called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to think about consent and personal boundaries. Using a condom is a personal choice. Even if she mentioned wanting kids soon, that doesn't mean she's not allowed to have her own preferences about contraception. But the issue here is that the user had brought his own, and she refused to use it. He felt scared and left. But why?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is about respecting each other's choices. If she's comfortable with using her own condom, but the user is not okay with that, maybe he should have discussed it beforehand. However, the user brought his own, so it's his right to prefer using it. But the girlfriend is the one who's in control of her body and her decisions. She has the right to say no to his condom if she doesn't want to use it. However, she might also have a responsibility to discuss her own method of contraception to ensure safety.\n\nBut the user is conflicted. He thought she wanted kids soon, so maybe he assumed she didn't need a condom. But she did mention not needing it, but maybe that was a misunderstanding. Now he's second-guessing his decision to leave. \n\nThe key points are: The user had a condom, she refused to use it, insisted on hers. He left, she and her friend are upset. The question is whether he was wrong for not using her condom. \n\nIn terms of health and safety, if both are using their own condoms, that's better. But using two condoms (his and hers) is not recommended because it can increase friction and break the condoms. So maybe she wanted to use her own, but he was already using his. However, in this case, he didn't use his because she refused. \n\nBut the user is the one who brought the condom. If she refuses to use it, he has the right to decline to proceed if he's uncomfortable. But in this case, he left. Is that wrong? Or is it her right to set the terms of the encounter?\n\nWait, consent is a mutual agreement. If one person is comfortable using their own method and the other is not, the person who is uncomfortable can choose to not proceed. So if he's not okay with using her condom, he's within his rights to say no. But in this case, she was making him use hers, and he refused. So he left. \n\nBut the user is now wondering if he was wrong for leaving. The girlfriend's friend is upset. Maybe the girlfriend was being controlling, making him use her condom when he brought his own. Alternatively, maybe she had valid reasons for her own method, and he's being stubborn. \n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong: If the user had a valid reason to prefer his own condom (maybe he brought it for safety, or he's not sure about her STI status), then he's in the right to stand his ground. However, if the issue is about her preferring her own method and him being inflexible, then maybe he's being rigid. \n\nBut the scenario says he was \"scared\" when she got persistent. Maybe he felt pressured. However, if she's the one who controls the situation, she has the right to set her boundaries. If he's uncomfortable with her terms, he can choose to not proceed. But in this case, he left, which might be his right. \n\nSo the user took the action of not using his own condom because she refused. But why is he considering himself wrong? Maybe because he left abruptly and now the friend is upset. Alternatively, maybe he should have discussed it more before deciding. \n\nBut in terms of who is in the wrong between the two of them, it's possible that the girlfriend was controlling, making him use her condom when he brought his own. However, he also has the right to his own preferences. The problem here might be communication. They should have discussed their preferences beforehand. \n\nBut the user is asking if he was in the wrong for not using his own condom. If he didn't use his because she said to use hers, then technically he didn't use his own. But he brought it, expecting to use it. She refused. He didn't use it. So in that case, he didn't use his own because she didn't let him. But he left. So maybe the issue is that he had the right to use his own. If she's not willing to proceed if he uses his, then he's in the right to leave. \n\nIn that case, he's not in the wrong. But if he's the one who is being inflexible and not respecting her choice, then he's in the wrong. \n\nGiven the details, he had his own condom, she refused to use it. He left. She and her friend are upset. The user is questioning his decision. The key is whether using his own condom was necessary. If he's on the pill, maybe she's using that. But he's not sure. Alternatively, maybe she's not on the pill. \n\nBut the problem is that the user is the one who chose to bring his own, but she's the one who controlled the situation. If he's uncomfortable with her terms, he's in the right to leave. So in this case, the user isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
