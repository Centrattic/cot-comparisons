Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a condom disagreement between him and his girlfriend.\n\nSo, the guy brought his own condom, but the girlfriend insisted on using hers. He thought she might want to get pregnant soon, but he wasn't sure. He ended up not using her condom and left. Now he's getting criticism from her friend, and he's second-guessing himself.\n\nHmm. First, consent and mutual agreement are key here. If the girlfriend insisted on using her own condom and he refused, maybe he didn't respect her wishes. But he had his own prepared, and she initially said no to his. Maybe there's a communication issue here. \n\nWait, the girlfriend mentioned wanting kids soon, but the guy thought she was just talking about maybe in a couple weeks. If she wanted to avoid pregnancy, using her condom would be logical. But if he didn't use it and left, maybe he didn't respect her boundaries. On the other hand, if she was insistent and it made him uncomfortable, maybe he had the right to leave. But is it wrong to not comply with her request? \n\nAlso, the friend called him an asshole, which might indicate that using her condom was important. The guy's reasoning for bringing his own was good, but if she's the one who's supposed to be using it for her own protection, maybe he should have honored that. \n\nWait, but why would she want her own condom? If she's on birth control and wants to get pregnant soon, maybe she's not using contraception. But if she's using her own condom, maybe she still wants protection. The guy might not have understood her intentions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe she was trying to prevent pregnancy for now but wanted to have kids later. If he pushed to use his condom, which she didn't want, maybe he was being inconsiderate. But he might have felt that he needed to use a condom for protection. \n\nBut the main point is about consent and mutual decisions. If she said no to his condom and insisted on hers, and he ignored that, then maybe he's at fault. However, if he felt pressured to use his condom and she was being manipulative, maybe there's a different angle. \n\nBut the situation is a bit ambiguous. The guy left, which might have been his right. But the question is whether he was wrong for not using her condom. If the girlfriend wanted to use her own, then he should have respected that. So maybe he is in the wrong for not complying with her wishes. Therefore, answer A.\n"
