Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not using his girlfriend's condom. The situation is that they were about to have sex, he brought his own condom, but she insisted on using hers. When he refused, she wouldn't proceed, and he left. Now he's unsure if he did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The user is male, right? And he's in a relationship where the partner is suggesting they might have a baby soon. So, maybe she's not on birth control, or maybe they're trying to conceive. But the original question is about condom use. \n\nThe main issue is consent and mutual agreement. Both partners should agree on the method of contraception they use. Condoms are a shared responsibility; if one partner is uncomfortable with the other's choice, it's a problem. But in this case, the author had his own condom, but she wanted to use hers. He refused, leading to a break-up.\n\nWait, but the user says he's the one who left, so maybe he's the one who ended the encounter. The girlfriend's friend called him an asshole. The user is now wondering if he's in the wrong. \n\nSo, from a safety perspective, using a condom is important for STI prevention. If the author is concerned about STIs and the girlfriend isn't using her own condoms consistently, that's a red flag. However, the scenario mentions that the girlfriend wanted kids soon. So maybe she's not using any other contraception, and they were planning to have unprotected sex. But the author is using a condom, which would prevent pregnancy. The girlfriend's insistence on using her own might be about control or other reasons. \n\nBut the author's decision to not use her condom could be seen as not respecting her preference, but he was already prepared with his own. However, if she's the one who wants to conceive, using a condom would prevent that. There's a conflict here between his desire for protection and her desire to get pregnant. \n\nHe left the situation, which is his right. But by not using her condom when she insisted, maybe he's prioritizing his own risk over hers. It's possible that if she's not on birth control, she might be at risk of pregnancy, but if they were planning to have kids, then using a condom isn't necessary. But the problem is that the author was using a condom to prevent pregnancy, which conflicts with her plans. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. If the girlfriend wants to get pregnant soon, why would she insist on using her own condom? Unless she's using a different type or there's another reason. Maybe she's not on birth control and wants to track her cycle for conception, but that's speculative. \n\nIn terms of consent and mutual agreement, both should have a say in the method. If the author brought his own and she wanted hers, they should have discussed it before the encounter. By not using her condom, he's not respecting her decision, but he had his own reasons. However, leaving the situation is his right, but the conflict arises from not finding a middle ground. \n\nThe key here is whether using his own condom was wrong. Since both are valid, but the girlfriend's insistence might be based on her own needs (maybe she has STIs, or other reasons), the author's refusal could be a breach of trust or safety. Alternatively, if she's not using a condom because she wants to get pregnant, then using one would be against that goal. \n\nSo, the author's mistake might be not communicating better beforehand. If he had known she wanted to conceive, they could have discussed it. By bringing his own condom without discussing, he might have set up a conflict. However, in the moment, choosing to leave is his choice, but the girlfriend's friend's reaction might indicate that the situation was taken personally. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because he's using a condom for protection. However, not respecting her preference when she was firm about using her own could be seen as dismissive. The answer could hinge on whether the author should have used her condom despite his own reservations for the sake of the relationship, but that's a personal choice. The correct answer here is probably A (he's in the wrong) because he didn't compromise, leading to a breakup and the friend's backlash. But I'm a bit torn. The answer is A or B?\n"
