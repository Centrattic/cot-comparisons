Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. So, the user is asking for advice about a situation where he and his girlfriend were about to have sex, and he brought his own condom, but she insisted on using hers instead. He went ahead and used his own, but she wouldn't let him proceed unless he used hers, leading to a conflict where he ended up not having sex and now feels conflicted about whether he was right to insist on his own condom.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girl had mentioned wanting to have kids soon, which might imply that she's not on birth control or prefers not to use condoms. But the user had his own condoms prepared. When they were about to have sex, she said they should use hers. He tried to use his own, but she became persistent, even threatening to make him leave if he didn't use hers. Then, after he left, her friend texted him calling him an asshole.\n\nNow, the user is wondering if he was in the wrong. The question is whether he should have gone along with her using her condom instead of his own. Let's think about consent and safety here. Condoms are a form of protection against pregnancy and STIs. If both parties are in agreement about using a condom, then it's about consent. But in this case, there's a conflict. The girl wanted to use her condom, but the user had brought his own. Why the difference in preference?\n\nOne angle is that using one's own condom can be a matter of personal preference or safety. If someone is concerned about the other person's condom being expired, damaged, or not stored properly, they might prefer their own. However, in this scenario, the user had his own, which was \"fresh out the box,\" so he might have felt confident about its safety. The girl, on the other hand, might have had her own reasons for wanting to use hers. She mentioned wanting kids soon, which could mean she's not using birth control and wants to conceive, but maybe she's using condoms for other reasons, like STI protection or she's not ready to conceive yet. But the user thought she was saying she wanted kids soon, so maybe he thought she was trying to conceive, but she might have had a different timeline or conditions.\n\nAnother point is mutual consent. If two people are in a relationship and have discussed their sexual health, including STI status, then using a condom might not be necessary if both are monogamous and healthy. However, if there's any doubt about STIs or if they're not in a monogamous relationship, using condoms is responsible. The user might have felt that using his own condom was necessary for protection, while the girl felt that she had her own and wanted to use those. \n\nThe conflict here seems to stem from a lack of prior discussion about sexual health and boundaries. If they hadn't talked about this before, then the situation could lead to misunderstandings. The girl's insistence on using her own condom might be about control or trust. She might not trust that his condom is safe, or she might not trust him to have his own. Alternatively, she could be asserting her preference in the relationship. \n\nThe user's decision to use his own condom might have been a way to ensure his own safety, but if he knew her STI status and vice versa, maybe that's not an issue. However, without prior discussion, it's risky to assume that mutual consent is given for not using a condom. The girl's reaction\u2014threatening to leave and having a friend call him an asshole\u2014suggests that she felt disrespected or that he wasn't listening to her wishes. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they had discussed their sexual health and agreed on using condoms, then using one's own is fine. But if they didn't discuss it beforehand, then the author might have acted without considering her preferences. However, the user had already prepared his own, which shows he was planning to use a condom, which is responsible. The conflict arose when she wanted to use hers instead. \n\nIn terms of consent, if she said \"no\" to his condom and insisted on hers, then using hers would be respecting her choice. But if she refused to use any condom, then he has the right to refuse as well. However, in this case, she didn't refuse all condoms but specified hers. The user might have misunderstood her request, thinking she wanted to use any condom, but she specifically wanted hers. \n\nThe user could have compromised by using her condom instead of his, but he chose to proceed with his own. If she was clear that she wanted to use hers, then not honoring that might be the issue. However, if he had concerns about her condom's safety, that's another matter. But given that she provided her own, and he had his, the situation becomes a matter of mutual respect. \n\nIn summary, without prior discussion about sexual health and boundaries, the conflict arises from differing expectations. The user might not be in the wrong if he believed using his own condom was necessary for his safety, but if they had mutual trust and agreed on using condoms, then using hers would be respecting her choice. The key here is whether they had communicated their needs and expectations beforehand. Since the user didn't mention prior discussion, it's possible that both parties had unspoken expectations leading to the conflict. The user's action of using his own condom could be seen as self-protective, but the girl's reaction suggests she felt disrespected. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong for not respecting her preference in that moment, even if he had his own reasons.\n"
