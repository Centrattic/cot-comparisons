Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not using his girlfriend's condom when she insisted they use hers instead of his. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author had a condom in his pocket, but when he pulled it out, the girlfriend said they should use hers. She was firm, even to the point of saying she wouldn't proceed unless they used hers. The author thought she wanted to use his, but she didn't. Then he left, and her friend called him an asshole. Now he's wondering if he was wrong to not comply.\n\nSo, from a health and safety perspective, using a condom is important for STI prevention. Both parties bring their own, but the girlfriend is pushing for hers. The author is confused and leaves. The girlfriend mentioned wanting kids soon, but maybe that's a red herring. Maybe she's on birth control and doesn't need a condom for pregnancy, but still wants her own for STI protection. The author might not have considered that she has her own reasons for using hers, like preferring her brand or trusting the one she provides.\n\nBut then again, using a condom is a personal choice, and if she's insisting on her own, the author could comply. However, the situation is a bit tense. The girlfriend is being forceful, even threatening to not proceed if he doesn't use hers. The author might be in a position where he's not comfortable with that pressure. In healthy relationships, both partners should communicate and agree on boundaries. If one partner is pressuring the other to use a specific condom, maybe there's an issue with mutual respect here.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's friend calling him an asshole suggests that maybe the girlfriend's friend thinks the author was wrong to leave. But the author left because he felt pressured. The key point is consent and mutual agreement. If the girlfriend is making it a non-negotiable issue, that could be a red flag. The author might be right to question if that pressure is healthy. However, from another angle, if the girlfriend is concerned about using her own condom (maybe for reasons like STIs, or personal preference), then the author not using hers could be an issue.\n\nBut the main thing is that both should agree on the use of a condom. If she's okay with not using one, but he wants to use hers, he can. But she's not okay with using his. Maybe she has her own reasons. However, the author left because he felt uncomfortable with her pressure. In that case, he's not wrong for walking away from a situation where he felt coerced. But if the girlfriend is insistent on using her own, and he's not willing to comply, maybe that's a problem. But the pressure from her side is the issue here. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong for not using his own condom when she insisted on hers. If the girlfriend is being manipulative or using guilt, then the author is justified in not complying. But if she's genuinely concerned about using her own (for health reasons), then not using hers could be a problem. However, since the author left instead of using hers, perhaps he's not in the wrong. The key is mutual consent and understanding. If the girlfriend is pressuring him to use her condom in a way that makes him uncomfortable, that's her issue. The author's choice to leave might be the right one, especially if he feels coerced. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
