Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he went over to his girlfriend, they were planning to have sex, and he brought his own condom. When he went to use it, she insisted on using hers instead, even to the point of threatening to end things if he didn't. He ended up leaving because she wouldn't let him use his own, and now he's wondering if he did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the norms are around condom use and consent. Generally, when it comes to sexual health, both partners should have a say in what's used. Using a condom is a mutual decision, and ideally, both partners should agree on it. But in some cases, there might be differing preferences. For example, maybe one partner prefers a specific type of condom, or there might be a medical reason to use one's own. But in this case, the girl said \"no\" to his condom and insisted on hers, even though he had already brought his. She also mentioned wanting to have kids soon, which might be a red flag because if she's trying to conceive, using a condom would prevent pregnancy. That seems contradictory, which might indicate she wasn't being honest about her intentions. \n\nThe author is confused because he thought she wanted to use her own condom, but maybe she actually wanted to get pregnant. But even so, if she's not using a condom, that's her choice, but she can't force him to not use one. Wait, but here's the twist: she's refusing to have sex unless he uses hers. He was bringing his own, but she's saying no to his and wants to use hers. But he's saying that he's not going to use hers and is leaving instead. \n\nSo the key points here are mutual consent and compromise. If both want to use a condom but have preferences, they can agree on which one to use. But in this case, the girl was being very firm, even to the point of threatening to end the encounter. The author's response was to leave, which is his right if he's uncomfortable with her demands. However, another angle is that he could have tried to compromise, like using her condom if he was okay with it, but he didn't. \n\nAlso, considering the context that she mentioned wanting kids soon, but then insisting on using a condom (which would prevent pregnancy), that might be a sign that she's not being honest. Maybe she wanted to have unprotected sex to get pregnant, but couldn't admit it. So by forcing him to use her condom, which she might not have used properly, or maybe she wanted to use it as a way to control the situation. \n\nBut from a safety standpoint, using a condom is about protection. If both are using protection, the type might not matter as much as mutual agreement. However, if she's refusing his, but insisting on hers, maybe she's trying to use a method that he's not comfortable with. But the author didn't mention any issues with her condom, just that he brought his own. \n\nSo, is the author wrong for not using her condom? Well, if she's refusing to use any, but he's not willing to have unprotected sex, then he's in the right. But in this case, she was willing to use a condom, just not his. If he's uncomfortable with her condom for some reason, like trusting her or the brand, then he's within his rights to leave. However, sometimes in relationships, compromise is necessary. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of respecting each other's boundaries. If he brought his own, maybe he expected to use it, and she's changing the plan. If she's willing to use a condom but not his, that's a choice he can respect or not. If he's not willing to respect her choice, then he's in the wrong. But if he has a valid reason not to trust her condom, like it's expired or not safe, that's different. \n\nIn this scenario, the girl's insistence might be an issue of control, especially if she's using the condom to prevent pregnancy but had previously mentioned wanting to have kids. That's a contradiction. The author might have been right to be cautious. However, if she's insistent on using her own, and he's not willing to comply, then he's choosing not to have sex, which is his right if he's uncomfortable. \n\nBut does that make him in the wrong? It depends on the context. If he's not willing to use a condom at all, then he might be in the wrong. But here, he's just not willing to use hers. If she's okay with using any condom, but just prefers hers, and he's not willing to use hers, then maybe he's being inflexible. However, if there's a valid reason he can't trust her, like the condom isn't safe, then he's justified. \n\nThe text mentions that she called him an asshole via her friend, which might indicate that she's being passive-aggressive or controlling. The author's choice to leave might be the right decision if he's not comfortable with her demands. So, in terms of being in the wrong, he might not be, because he's standing up for his own boundaries. However, if the issue was about mutual agreement, maybe he should have found a middle ground. But given that she was forcing him to use her condom, and he felt scared, leaving was a reasonable choice. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be in the wrong. He had his own prepared condom, and when she refused to use his, he left instead of complying with her demand. His decision to prioritize his own comfort regarding condom use could be seen as correct, especially if he's not comfortable with her choice. Therefore, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
