Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who brought a condom, but the girlfriend insisted on using hers. He didn't go through with the act and now the girlfriend's friend is calling him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. The girlfriend wanted to use her own condom, which he refused. Then she said she wouldn't proceed unless they used hers. He left. The question is whether he was wrong for not using her condom instead of his own.\n\nFrom a health perspective, using a condom is important for STI prevention. But the key here is mutual consent. If she was adamant about using her own, but he wasn't comfortable, there's a communication issue. However, she was using it as a condition to continue, and he chose not to. That could be seen as respecting his own boundaries. But if he was okay with using hers, perhaps he should have. However, he might have concerns about the condom's source or safety. \n\nAlso, she mentioned wanting kids soon, which might imply she doesn't want to get pregnant. Using a condom would prevent pregnancy, so maybe he was okay with that. But the issue is about using her condom. If she's against using his, maybe there's a trust issue, or she's uncomfortable with him preparing. Alternatively, maybe she just wanted to have control over the situation.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, consent is mutual. If one partner insists on a condition the other isn't comfortable with, they should communicate. The guy left, which is a valid choice to not proceed if he's uncomfortable. But if he had agreed to use hers earlier, then not using it could be a problem. However, in the scenario, he already had his condom ready. She then refused to proceed unless they used hers, so he left. So he didn't force the issue. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he walked away without causing harm, maybe not. But if the situation involved her being pressured into using his condom and he wasn't willing to compromise, maybe the issue is more about communication. However, since he left and didn't proceed, he's not the one in the wrong. The friend calling him an asshole is part of the problem too. The main question is whether he was wrong for not using her condom. If using a condom is a mutual agreement, then both should agree. Since she was insistent and he left, he's not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
