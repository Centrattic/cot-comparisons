Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who brought his own condom to have sex with his girlfriend, but she insisted on using hers instead. He didn't want to, so he left, and now her friend is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girl wants to have kids soon, but the guy thought they'd just be messing around for a while. She refused to let him use his condom and even threatened to make him leave if he didn't use hers. He left, and now he's getting flak about it.\n\nThe main issue here is consent and the use of protection. Both parties should have a say in what they're comfortable with. The girl clearly wanted to use her own condom, possibly because she's planning to get pregnant and maybe wanted to track her cycle or something. But the guy had his own reasons for bringing his own, maybe he wanted to ensure it was safe or he's used to using his own. \n\nBut here's the thing: STI prevention is important. If the guy was concerned about possible STIs and wanted to use his own condom, it's his right to do so. However, if the girl is in a position where she's insisting on using hers, maybe she feels safer with her own, but she's also putting pressure on him to comply. \n\nIn terms of consent, both parties need to agree on the terms. If the girl is pressuring him to use her condom against his will, that's a problem. But if she's just stating her preference and he doesn't agree, then he has every right to leave. However, the situation might be more complex. If the girl is trying to get pregnant, maybe she's on birth control or using other methods, but that's not clear here. \n\nAnother angle is that the girl might feel that using her own condom is more about her comfort and control, but if the guy is uncomfortable with that, he's within his rights to say no. However, if he's the one who's not using protection because he's not in a relationship, but he's in a relationship now, maybe he's supposed to respect her boundaries. \n\nWait, the user says it's his girlfriend. So the fact that she wants to use her own condom might be her way of maintaining some control in the situation, maybe to track her ovulation or something. But if he's not on the same page, and he's bringing his own, maybe he's not respecting her method. \n\nBut the main ethical question is about consent and respect for each other's boundaries. If the girl is pressuring him to use her condom and he's not comfortable, then he should be able to leave. However, if he's not using any protection because he's not okay with her choice, but she's also not okay with his, then both are in a stalemate. \n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong: If the guy left because he didn't want to use her condom, but she felt strongly about using hers, maybe he was right to prioritize his own comfort. But if she was trying to pressure him into using hers without considering his preferences, then he's not in the wrong. However, if there's a risk of STI transmission because he's not using a condom, then maybe he's being selfish by not using hers. But if he's in a monogamous relationship and they've both been tested, then it's a different scenario. \n\nThe girl's friend calling him an asshole might be adding to the pressure, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's wrong. It's more about mutual respect. So, the answer is probably B\u2014he's not in the wrong because he left when she was pressuring him to use her condom, which he wasn't comfortable with.\n"
