Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement over using a condom. The key points here are consent and mutual agreement. \n\nThe author brought his own condom, which is responsible behavior. The girlfriend insisted on using hers, and even said not to proceed if he didn't use hers. The author left because he wasn't comfortable with using her condom instead of his own. \n\nNow, considering STI prevention and pregnancy prevention, using a condom is important. However, the issue here is who supplies it. If the woman is the one who insists on using her own, the author might have valid concerns if he doesn't trust her STI status or if there's a power dynamic at play. On the other hand, if they're in a trusting relationship and she's on birth control, maybe the condom wasn't necessary, but she still had the right to set boundaries.\n\nThe author left when she said he had to use hers, which could be seen as respecting her boundaries by not proceeding against her wishes. However, if he felt pressured and left, maybe he wasn't in the wrong for walking away. But the friend calling him an asshole might indicate that there's a social expectation to comply with her request. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The author's decision to leave could be seen as standing by his own safety, which is understandable. But if the situation was a mutual decision and he didn't respect her boundary, then he might be in the wrong. However, since she was the one who set the boundary and he left instead of complying, maybe he's not at fault. \n\nAlso, the woman mentioned wanting kids soon, which might mean she's not on birth control, so using a condom would still be necessary. If the author was uncomfortable using her condom because of lack of trust, he wasn't wrong to leave. So overall, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
