Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not using his girlfriend's condom and choosing to leave instead. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had his own condom, but the girlfriend insisted on using hers. She even said she wouldn't proceed unless they used hers, and then he left. The girlfriend mentioned wanting kids soon, which the author didn't take seriously at first. Now he's doubting his decision.\n\nI should think about consent and autonomy here. Both partners should have a say in their sexual health decisions. The girlfriend might have valid reasons for preferring her own condoms, like safety or personal choice. However, the author also has the right to use his own. But when the girlfriend made it a deal-breaker, the author chose to leave, which might be seen as a boundary he's setting.\n\nIn many relationships, both partners should agree on the terms of their sexual activity. If one partner insists on a condition that the other isn't comfortable with, walking away isn't necessarily wrong. However, if there was prior agreement or if the author was aware of her stance on using her own condoms, then refusing might be an issue. But in this case, the author didn't know she wanted to use hers specifically. The girlfriend's insistence could be seen as controlling, but the author's choice to leave because he wasn't comfortable could also be his right.\n\nAnother angle is the health aspect. Using a condom is a mutual decision, but if there's a trust issue or a medical reason, the partner might prefer their own. However, the author's decision to leave rather than comply might be about respecting his own boundaries. \n\nIn terms of social norms, sometimes people feel pressured to comply in such situations, but it's important to prioritize personal comfort and health. The author didn't use his condom, which could be risky for STIs if the girlfriend's condoms aren't reliable. However, the girlfriend's insistence might be based on trust or other factors.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong if he felt uncomfortable using her condom for valid reasons. Walking away when a partner makes a demand that he's not comfortable with is respecting his own boundaries. However, if the girlfriend's request was part of a pre-established agreement, then the author might be in the wrong. But given the information, it seems like the author made a choice based on his own comfort, which is his right.\n"
