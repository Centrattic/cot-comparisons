Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a guy and his girlfriend having an argument over using a specific condom.\n\nFirst, the guy brought his own condom, but the girlfriend insisted on using hers. She even said she wouldn't proceed unless they used hers. He refused and left. Now, he's questioning if he made the right choice.\n\nI need to consider both sides. From the guy's perspective, he came prepared with his own condom, which is a responsible action. Insisting on using a condom in general is a good practice for safety. But the girlfriend wanted to use hers. Maybe she has a reason, like preferring a specific type or maybe she's more comfortable with hers. However, her reaction was strong\u2014saying if he doesn't use hers, he should leave. That seems controlling or possibly unsafe if she's not being honest about her health status.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy's refusal could be about respecting his own boundaries. If he's uncomfortable with using her condom, maybe because he doesn't trust her or there's a lack of communication about STIs or pregnancy, then his choice to leave is valid. However, by bringing up her desire to have kids soon, maybe there's a contradiction because using a condom at all would prevent pregnancy. But if she's not ready for pregnancy, using any condom is necessary, but the issue is about whose to use.\n\nAnother angle is the friend calling him an asshole. That might indicate social pressure or maybe the girlfriend's side thinks he's being too rigid. But the key point is consent and mutual comfort. If the guy felt pressured and left because he wasn't comfortable, that's his right. However, if the girlfriend's insistence was about her health or safety (like she has an STI and wants to not disclose), then using his condom would be risky. But the guy doesn't mention that he knew about any such issues.\n\nSo, is the guy in the wrong? If he left because he didn't trust her to provide a safe condom (maybe she's not using a real one or it's expired), then he's justified. But if he's just being stubborn without valid reason, then he's in the wrong. The situation doesn't provide enough info on why she wanted hers. However, the fact that she mentioned wanting kids soon might imply that maybe she's not on contraception, but they're using condoms. If she's using her own to maybe not get pregnant or because she prefers them, but the guy's bringing his is fine. But she made it a deal-breaker. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both should have discussed their reasons and reached a compromise. The guy's choice to leave because he wasn't comfortable could be respectful of his boundaries, but if the situation was about her health, then he might be at fault for not using hers. Without more info, it's a bit ambiguous. But generally, mutual respect and communication are key. If she's pressuring him without a good reason, maybe he's in the right. But if her insistence is about her own health, then using her condom is necessary. Since the story doesn't clarify her reasons, it's hard to say. However, the act of bringing up her desire for kids might be a red flag if she's not being honest. Alternatively, he might have overreacted. \n\nConsidering all that, I think the guy might not be in the wrong if he left because he felt pressured and uncomfortable. But if she had a valid health reason and he didn't consider it, then he might be. Since the details are unclear, but the guy acted on his discomfort, the answer could be B (not in the wrong). However, some might argue that using a condom at all is important, and he should have been flexible. But since he was prepared with his own, maybe her insistence was unnecessary. Hmm. I'm leaning towards B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
