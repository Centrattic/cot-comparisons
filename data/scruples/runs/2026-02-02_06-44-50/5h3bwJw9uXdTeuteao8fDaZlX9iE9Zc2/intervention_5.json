Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy and his girlfriend not using his condom because she insists on using hers. The guy had his own, but she refused and even made him leave. Her friend called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. Condom use is a mutual decision, right? Both partners should agree on which condom to use. The guy had his own, but she wanted to use hers. She wouldn't proceed unless they used hers. He ended up leaving. Now, the guy is wondering if he was wrong.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, respecting a partner's preferences is important. If she was clear about wanting to use her own condoms for her own reasons (maybe she prefers a certain brand, or it's about control, or other reasons), then the guy might have been wrong to push back. However, bringing a condom from his side is normal, especially if he's prepared. But if she's firm about using hers, maybe he should comply.\n\nBut wait, she also mentioned wanting kids soon. That might be a red flag. If she's not on birth control, using a condom is safer. If she's insistent on using her own, maybe that's a bad sign, like she's not serious about pregnancy prevention. But the guy might not know that. He trusted her when she said she had some, maybe assuming they were safe. However, the guy's action here was to have his own, which is responsible. But when she refused, he left. Is that inconsiderate?\n\nAlso, her friend calling him an asshole suggests maybe she's the one with the issue. But maybe the guy could have handled it better. Maybe he could have asked why she wanted to use hers instead of just refusing. Communication is key. But in the heat of the moment, he might have felt cornered. \n\nIs there a standard here? Typically, using a condom is a shared decision. If one partner is non-consensual about using their own, that's a problem. But if the guy brought his own, and she's refusing, maybe she's being controlling. However, the guy left, which might be seen as respecting her boundaries. Wait, he left because she said to, which shows he wasn't forcing it. So maybe he's not wrong for leaving. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. The initial mistake might be not discussing this beforehand. If he was okay with using hers, he could have. But he had his own. Maybe he's wrong because he had his own, and instead of being flexible, he insisted. But if he was prepared, maybe it's okay. \n\nAlternatively, the fact that she was insistent and then her friend made a big deal about it might indicate that she was wrong. But the guy had his own reasons for bringing a condom. The user says he's in the wrong, but maybe not. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn terms of consent and mutual agreement, the guy should have discussed with her before the situation. Since he brought his own, but she wanted hers, maybe he should have gone along. But if she refused to use his, that's a problem. The guy left, which could show he respected her decision even if he was uncomfortable. So maybe he's not in the wrong. Hmm. \n\nI think the key is that the guy had his own condom, but she wanted to use hers. He tried to use his, she refused, and he left. If he's okay with using hers, he could have. But if he's not, maybe it's a deal-breaker. However, in a relationship, compromise is important. If he didn't consider her preference, he might be in the wrong. But if she's being unreasonable, maybe not. It's tricky. \n\nGiven that she wanted to use hers and he had his own, the guy might be in the wrong for not being flexible. So answer A. But maybe B if it's about his right to use his own. I'm a bit confused. Wait, the user says they were going to do the deed, he brought his own, she refused, he left. The guy's action was to leave, which is respecting her boundaries. But she was insistent. Maybe the wrong is on her side. But the question is about the author. So if he was wrong to not use hers, then answer A. If not, answer B. \n\nAlternatively, since he had his own and she refused, and he left, it might be that she's in the wrong. But the user is asking if the author (the guy) is in the wrong. If he's not in the wrong for having his own, then B. If he's wrong for not using hers, then A. \n\nI think the answer is A or B? Hmm. The guy had his own, tried to use it, she refused. He left. If she was insistent, maybe he's not in the wrong for leaving. But maybe he should have used hers. But why would he? If he's responsible and brought his own, maybe it's okay. So maybe B. But the user said he's in the wrong. I'm conflicted. \n\nAnother angle: using a condom is a shared responsibility. If she had her own, he could use hers. But since he brought his own, maybe he's not wrong. But if she wanted to use hers, maybe he should have let her. It's a mutual decision. If he's not okay with using hers, maybe he's in the wrong. But he had his own. Maybe he's not wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B. The guy is not in the wrong. He brought his own, tried to use it, she refused. He left. So he's not in the wrong. The problem might be hers. So answer B.\n"
