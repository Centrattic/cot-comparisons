Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about using a condom. The user went over to his girlfriend and had a condom ready. She insisted on using hers instead, even to the point of threatening to end the encounter if he didn't. He refused and left. Now he's wondering if he did the right thing.\n\nFirst, consent and communication are key in any sexual situation. The user had a condom, which he provided. The girlfriend wanted to use hers, possibly because she might be planning to get pregnant soon, as mentioned. But why would she insist on using her own condom? Maybe she had specific reasons, or maybe she wanted to control the situation. The user felt scared and left. \n\nNow, is it wrong to not use her condom? If she's the one who brought up the topic of wanting kids soon, maybe using her condom would have been a step towards that. But wait, if they're using a condom, regardless of whose it is, they're still preventing pregnancy. Unless her condom is a placebo or something else. Maybe she was trying to have unprotected sex? That's a possibility. \n\nIf she's insistent on using her own condom, maybe there's an ulterior motive. Like, if she's not on birth control and wants to get pregnant, but he's not ready. In that case, he's protecting himself by not agreeing. But he already had a condom, so using hers would still be protected. Unless she's not using a real condom. That's a red flag. \n\nOn the other hand, if she's insistent and he's refusing, is that a sign of disrespect? Maybe she wanted to have unprotected sex and he didn't realize. If that's the case, he's in the right for not agreeing. But if they were both okay with using a condom, then using hers shouldn't be an issue. \n\nThe fact that her friend called him an asshole complicates things. Maybe the girlfriend was pressuring him for a reason that's not healthy. The user's hesitation and leaving might be a good sign he's respecting his own boundaries. \n\nSo, considering all that, the user isn't in the wrong if he's not comfortable with using her condom for a reason he's not aware of (like maybe she's not using a real one). Standing by his own condom shows he's responsible. But if they were supposed to be using a condom regardless, then not using hers isn't wrong. The key is mutual consent and understanding. Since she was pushy, maybe he was right to leave if he felt uncomfortable. So answer B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
