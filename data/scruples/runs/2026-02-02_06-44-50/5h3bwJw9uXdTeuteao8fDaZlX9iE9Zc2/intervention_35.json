Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author went over to his girlfriend (or a girl he's been talking to for a few weeks) and wanted to use a condom he brought. The girl said she had her own and insisted they use hers, even to the point of threatening to make him leave if he didn't. The author then left, and now he's unsure if he did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girl mentioned she wants kids soon, which is important. If she's planning to get pregnant soon, using a condom might not be necessary if they're trying, but she said she wanted to use hers. The author brought his own, and she was insistent about using hers. The author was scared and left, and now he's being called an asshole by her friend.\n\nSo, the main issue is about consent and the use of condoms. Condoms are about safety and mutual agreement. If the girl is insistent on using her own, maybe she has a reason. Maybe she's not on birth control, or there's another health reason. But the author had the right to bring his own. However, she was the one who set the boundary here by saying she won't proceed unless her condom is used. The author then left, which could be seen as respecting her boundaries or being stubborn. \n\nBut in relationships, communication is key. If the author had questions about her wanting kids soon versus her insistence on using a condom, he should have asked for clarification. However, the girl was clear in her stance, and the author left. The friend calling him an asshole might be overreacting, but maybe the author didn't handle it gracefully. \n\nOn the other hand, if the girl is trying to get pregnant soon, why use a condom at all? Unless she's not ready yet or there's another reason. The author might have felt confused, but he should have discussed it more instead of just leaving. However, the girl was firm, so the author's choice to leave could be seen as standing by his decision. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. But generally, in sexual situations, both parties should agree on the use of protection. The girl was clear, and the author respected her boundary by not using his own. The problem might be that the author didn't check if the girl's condom was safe and effective. If she had her own, it's her responsibility to provide it. The author's action of leaving might be seen as respecting her decision, but the friend's reaction suggests maybe the author should have been more flexible. \n\nWait, but the author had a condom and was prepared. The girl's insistence on using hers might have been a red flag. If she didn't want to use a condom, but she said she had her own, maybe she was trying to get him to have unprotected sex. The author might have been right to be cautious, but then he left when she got insistent. However, if she's the one setting the boundary, he should follow it. \n\nI think the main issue here is the lack of communication. The author could have asked why she wanted to use hers instead of his, but he didn't. The girl was clear, and he left. Maybe the author was in the right by not using his condom if she insisted on hers, but the situation is messy. Alternatively, the author could have been more flexible if he trusted her and her intentions. Since the girl mentioned wanting kids soon, maybe using a condom isn't necessary if they're trying, but she might not be ready yet. \n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong, the author might be in the right by respecting her decision to use her own condom, but if the girl was pressuring him in a way that felt uncomfortable, maybe he was right to leave. However, the fact that he left and then the friend called him an asshole complicates things. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's choice to not use his condom when she insisted on hers might be in the right if he's respecting her boundaries. But if the girl's insistence was a way to avoid using protection for her own reasons (like not being on birth control and wanting to get pregnant), then the author might be protecting himself by using his own. However, the girl's refusal to let him use his own could be a sign of control or lack of communication. \n\nIn the end, I think the author is in the right because he brought a condom, tried to use it, but respected her boundary by not using his own when she was insistent. The problem is that the situation wasn't resolved with proper communication. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
