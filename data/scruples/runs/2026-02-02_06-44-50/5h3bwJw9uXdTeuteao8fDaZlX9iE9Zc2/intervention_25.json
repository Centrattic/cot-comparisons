Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy brought his own condom, but the girl insisted on using hers and wouldn't proceed unless he used hers. He thought she wanted to use protection, but then she mentioned wanting kids soon. He got scared and left. Now, he's wondering if he made the wrong choice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy had his own condom, which is responsible, right? But the girl wanted to use hers. Why would she do that? Maybe she had a preference, maybe she wanted to use her own for some reason. But then she mentions wanting kids soon. Wait, if she wants to get pregnant, maybe she didn't want to use a condom at all. So maybe she was trying to get pregnant but didn't want to tell him directly. So when he tried to use his, she wanted to use hers but maybe those were fake or not really for protection. That could be a problem because if her condoms aren't effective, that's a risk. But why would she do that?\n\nOn the other hand, the guy had the right to use his own condoms. If the girl is pressuring him to use hers, maybe she's not being honest. Also, if she's insistent to the point of refusal if he doesn't comply, that's a red flag. Consent is important. Both parties should agree on the method of protection. If she's pressuring him to use hers without explaining, maybe she's hiding something. \n\nThe guy left, which might be a good choice because he was scared. But he's now doubting if he should have gone along. If she wanted kids, maybe she's manipulating him. But if she has her own condoms, maybe she just prefers them. However, the fact that she mentioned wanting kids soon but still wanted to use a condom is confusing. Maybe she wanted to get pregnant but didn't want the guy to know, so she tried to use her own condom, which might be faulty. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, bringing your own condom is a safe choice. If the girl is insistent on using hers, maybe she has a reason. But if she's pressuring him, that's not healthy. The guy has the right to refuse if he's uncomfortable. Also, if she's not being honest about her intentions, that's a problem. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he was using a condom to prevent pregnancy and she wanted to get pregnant, then he was acting correctly. If she wanted to use her own for some reason, maybe she's not being truthful. But the guy left, which could be a sign of self-respect. But maybe he could have asked her why she wanted to use hers. However, she was persistent and even had a friend call him an asshole. \n\nHmm. The key points are mutual consent and honesty. If she was lying about her intentions, then the author did the right thing by leaving. If she was honest, maybe there's a misunderstanding. But since she mentioned wanting kids soon, maybe she's not being truthful. So the author might not be in the wrong because he was using protection, and she was pressuring him to use hers without clear reasons. So answer B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
