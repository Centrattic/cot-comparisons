Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who brought his own condom to his girlfriend, but she refused to use it and insisted on using hers. He ended up leaving because she wouldn't let him use his, and now her friend is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The woman said she wanted to use her own condom. The author had already brought one, but she was firm. The user is wondering if he made the right choice by not using her condom. \n\nNow, the main issue here is consent and safety. Using a condom is about protection, both for STIs and pregnancy. If the woman is the one who provided the condom, maybe she had a reason\u2014maybe it's a specific type she prefers, or perhaps she's checking that he uses it correctly. But in this case, the author was already bringing one, so why the insistence on using hers?\n\nWait, the woman mentioned she wants kids soon. That's a bit confusing because if she's trying to get pregnant, using a condom would prevent that. Unless she's using the condom for STI protection but not for contraception. Maybe she wants to ensure he's using a condom correctly, or perhaps she's not ready for unprotected sex yet. \n\nBut the key point is consent. If she said no to his condom and insisted on hers, and he went along with that, then maybe it's okay. However, the problem here is that the author didn't end up using any condom. Wait, the story says he pulled out his own, but she refused and said they must use hers. But the author didn't end up using hers either\u2014because he left. So he didn't end up having sex at all. \n\nWait, the TL;DR says she wouldn't let him have sex unless he used hers. But he left. So he didn't use a condom. The problem is that if he left, then he didn't engage in the act. So maybe the issue is whether he should have gone along with her condom or left. \n\nBut the author is now second-guessing himself. The friend called him an asshole, implying that he was wrong to leave. But from his perspective, he was prepared, she refused his condom, and he left. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. In terms of consent, both partners should agree on the terms of the encounter. If the woman was insistent on using her own condom, then the author could have respected her choice. However, if he's uncomfortable using her condom for any reason (maybe he doesn't trust it, or there's some other reason), he should have communicated that. But in this case, he just left, which might be seen as not respecting her boundaries if she was okay with using a condom but just wanted to use her own. \n\nAlternatively, if the woman is trying to pressure him into using her condom, maybe she's trying to test his commitment or ensure he's using protection correctly. If he's not willing to use a condom at all, then he's in the wrong. But in this case, he brought one, tried to use it, she refused, and he left. So he didn't proceed without a condom, which is responsible. \n\nBut the problem is that he didn't use any condom. Wait, no\u2014because he left. So he didn't have sex. So maybe he's not in the wrong for not having sex if he's uncomfortable. But the friend's reaction suggests that he should have gone along with her terms. \n\nHmm. This is a bit tricky. The main point is that both partners should communicate and agree. If the woman is insistent on using her own condom, and he's okay with that, then it's fine. But if he's uncomfortable using hers for any reason, he should have discussed it. However, in this case, he left, which might be seen as not respecting her boundaries if she was okay with using a condom but wanted to use her own. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not using her condom if that was part of the agreement she required. But since he didn't proceed, maybe it's a misunderstanding. \n\nAlternatively, if he was prepared to use his own and she insisted on hers, but he left instead of using hers, maybe he's in the wrong because he didn't compromise. But if he's not comfortable using her condom for any reason (maybe it's expired or he doesn't trust it), then he's right to not use it. However, the story doesn't mention any such issue. \n\nSo considering all that, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong because he was prepared, she refused his condom, and he left without having sex. Therefore, he didn't proceed without a condom. However, the friend's reaction is that he's an asshole, but perhaps the author was asserting his own preference. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. In terms of consent, both should agree. If she said no to his condom and he went along, that's okay. If he refused to use hers, then he's in the wrong. But he left. So he didn't proceed. Therefore, he's not in the wrong because he didn't have sex without a condom. However, maybe he should have used her condom to respect her wishes. \n\nThis is a bit of a toss-up. But the key is that he didn't have sex without a condom. The woman wanted to use a condom, so he's not in the wrong for not proceeding without one. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
