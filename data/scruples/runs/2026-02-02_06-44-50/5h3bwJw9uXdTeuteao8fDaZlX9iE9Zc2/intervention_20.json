Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement about condom use between him and his girlfriend. He brought his own, but she insisted on using hers and even threatened to end the encounter if he didn't. He left, and now he's questioning his decision.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend mentioned wanting to have kids soon, so maybe she's not on birth control or wants to track her cycle. When he offered his condom, she refused and insisted on hers. But then, after he left, her friend called him an asshole, making him doubt his choice.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, consent and safety are important here. Both parties should have a say in the method of protection. If she's uncomfortable with his condom, maybe there's an issue with trust or past experiences. However, the main issue here is that he had the right to use his own condom. Insisting on using hers might be a valid choice, but refusing his and making him leave could be seen as manipulative or controlling. \n\nHe tried to use a condom, which is responsible. She had the right to express her preference, but not to the point of him feeling threatened. The red flag is when she said if he didn't use hers, he should leave. That's a form of coercion. So, he left, which is a valid response if he felt pressured. \n\nBut maybe the user is overthinking. The correct approach is mutual agreement. Since she was insistent and he was scared, he did the right thing by leaving. So, the answer would be B (he's not in the wrong) because he was standing up for his boundaries and prioritizing his safety.\n"
