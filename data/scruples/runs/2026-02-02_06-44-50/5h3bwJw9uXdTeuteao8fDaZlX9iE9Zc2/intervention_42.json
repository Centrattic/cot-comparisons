Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement over which condom to use. The author had his own condom ready, but the girlfriend insisted on using hers. He refused and left, and now he's feeling conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been talking for 3-4 weeks, which is a short time. The girlfriend mentioned wanting kids soon, but the author didn't take that seriously at first. When she insists on using her condom, he hesitates and leaves. The key issue here is consent and mutual agreement on contraceptive use.\n\nCondoms are a personal choice, and both partners should agree on their use. The girlfriend's insistence might be about her control over her reproductive choices, even if she plans to have kids eventually. If she's using her own condoms, maybe she has specific reasons, like brand preference, medical reasons, or simply wanting to manage her own contraception. By refusing to use hers, the author is disregarding her preference, which could be seen as dismissing her autonomy.\n\nHowever, the author did bring his own condom, which shows he was prepared. But the problem arises when the girlfriend insists on hers. In a healthy relationship, both partners should negotiate and respect each other's boundaries. The author's refusal to comply with her condition and leaving might be seen as a way to avoid confrontation, but it also respects her boundaries. On the other hand, the girlfriend's ultimatum could be seen as pressuring him, but she has the right to set her own limits.\n\nThere's also the aspect of trust and communication. If the author was worried about STIs, using his own condom might be his way of protecting himself. But if they are in a monogamous relationship and both are tested, that's different. However, the story doesn't mention STI status, so that's an assumption.\n\nThe friend calling the author an asshole might be a red herring or a way to escalate the situation. The main issue is mutual respect. The author could argue he was respecting her decision by not using his own, but she wanted to use hers, so his refusal to comply led to a stalemate. Maybe the right approach would have been to discuss it calmly and find a solution, but in the heat of the moment, he left. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have some accountability. The author chose to follow his own plan, while the girlfriend set a boundary. Depending on the context, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her boundary, but if he had valid reasons (like STI protection), he might not be. The question is whether using her condom was a necessary condition for her consent. If she refused to proceed without using hers, and he didn't want to use hers for a valid reason, the situation becomes a conflict between mutual consent and personal boundaries.\n\nSince the author left, he didn't force anything, which is a positive. But by not using her condom, he might have been violating her terms. However, without more info on why she wanted hers, it's hard to say. In many cases, respecting a partner's choice in contraception is important. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not using hers when she specified that's what she wanted. Alternatively, if there's a reason he shouldn't use her condom (like STI concerns), he's justified. But the story doesn't mention that. So based on the information given, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her preference.\n"
