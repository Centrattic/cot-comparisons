Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a man who brought his own condom to a sexual encounter but the woman insisted on using hers. He was okay with using a condom, but she wouldn't let him use his and instead wanted hers. He ended up leaving because she refused, and now he's getting messages from her friend calling him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Condom use is about mutual agreement and safety. The man came prepared, which is responsible. The woman wanted to use her own, which is also her right. But here's the catch: when it comes to sexual health, both partners should have control. If she's insisting on using her own, but he's comfortable with that, it's okay. However, if there's a power dynamic where one person is pressuring the other, that's a problem.\n\nHe mentions she said she wants kids soon. Maybe she doesn't want to use a condom because of that, but he might be okay with using her condom for protection. Wait, but why would she bring her own? Maybe she's on birth control and doesn't need an extra condom, but if he's not on PrEP or something, he might still want his own. Alternatively, maybe she's not on birth control and wants to conceive, so she doesn't want him to use a condom. But if he's not ready for kids, that's a conflict. But the user didn't clarify that. He just says he thought she wanted to maybe mess around for a while. \n\nThe main issue here is consent and autonomy. The woman is making a decision about the condom, which is her right. However, if he's uncomfortable with her choice for any reason (like not trusting her to have a safe supply, or if he's not okay with the possibility of pregnancy), then he should have the right to say no. But in this case, he was willing to use a condom, but she wanted to use hers. Since he's the one who brought his own, maybe there's an issue of distrust. If she's insistent that her condom is okay, but he's not sure, then he's in a conflict between his desire to use a condom and her desire to use hers.\n\nBut from a safety perspective, using any condom is better than none. However, if there's a reason he's concerned about her condom (like maybe he's not sure if it's safe, or if she's not on birth control and he doesn't want to risk pregnancy), then his refusal is justified. The problem arises if she's pressuring him to use her condom despite his concerns. But in the story, he was okay with using a condom but she wanted to use hers. If he's okay with using a condom as long as it's her's, then she has the right to make that choice. However, if he wanted to use his own and she's forcing him to use hers, that's a problem.\n\nWait, but the user says he was okay with using a condom but she wanted to use hers. So maybe he's not against using a condom but is particular about whose it is. The woman is asserting her control over the situation, which is her right. But if he's uncomfortable with that, he should have the right to say no. However, in this case, he was willing to use a condom, but the woman didn't want him to use his. If he's okay with using hers, then she's not in the wrong. But if he has a reason to not trust her condom (maybe she's not on birth control, or there's a health concern), then he's justified in not using hers. However, the story doesn't mention any of these points. He just says she was persistent and he left.\n\nSo, considering consent and mutual agreement, both should have a say. If he was okay with using a condom but not hers, then he's in the wrong. But if he was okay with using a condom, and she wanted to use hers, then she's within her rights to insist on using hers. However, if he's not comfortable using a condom at all, then he's in the right to leave. But the key here is that he brought his own condom, indicating he wanted to use one. The woman is making a choice about which condom to use, which is part of her autonomy. However, he's the one who wanted to proceed with his own, so if she's not allowing that, and he's not okay with hers, then leaving is his choice. But the problem is whether he was wrong to not use her condom when he was okay with using a condom in general. If he's okay with using a condom, but not hers, then he's being selective. But if he's okay with using a condom regardless of whose it is, then he should have used hers. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both should have control. The woman's decision to not use his condom is her choice, but if he's not comfortable with that, he has the right to leave. However, the user is asking if he's in the wrong. Since he was okay with using a condom but the woman wanted to use hers, and he left because she wouldn't let him use his, then maybe he's in the wrong because he was willing to use a condom but not hers. Alternatively, if he's not comfortable with using her condom for any reason, even if they don't mention it, then he's not in the wrong. \n\nBut the story says he was scared when she mentioned wanting kids soon. Maybe he's worried about pregnancy but she's not using a condom. If she's on birth control, then maybe she doesn't need a condom, but if he's not on PrEP, then he might want one for STI protection. Alternatively, if she's not on birth control and he doesn't want to risk pregnancy, then using a condom is necessary. But she's not allowing him to use one. In that case, he's in the right to refuse. But the story says he was okay with using a condom, but she wanted to use hers. So maybe he was okay with using a condom, but she's not allowing him to use his, so he's not in the wrong for not using his. However, the woman is in the right to choose her own condom. \n\nThis is a bit tricky. The key is mutual consent. If he was okay with using a condom, and she wanted to use hers, then he should have used hers. If he's not okay with that, he should have left. Since he was okay with using a condom, but not hers, then he's being a bit possessive or maybe not trusting her. Therefore, he's in the wrong for not using her condom when he agreed to use one. Alternatively, if there's a reason he can't use her condom (like health reasons), then he's not in the wrong. But the story doesn't mention that. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he was okay with using a condom but refused to use hers, which is her right to choose. Therefore, he should have used hers.\n"
