Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy going over to his girlfriend and bringing his own condom, but she insists on using hers instead. He was planning to use his, but she won't let him and even threatens to end things if he doesn't use hers. He leaves, and then her friend texts him a message calling him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around condom use and consent. Condoms are a personal choice, right? Each person should have the right to decide which one is used. Using a condom is important for protection against STIs and pregnancy, so both people should agree on it. The guy brought his own, which shows he's responsible. But the girl insisted on using hers. Maybe she's more comfortable with her own, or maybe she has specific reasons like not wanting to use a brand she doesn't trust. However, the problem might be that he was prepared with his own, and she made it a condition to use hers, leading to a conflict.\n\nWait, the girl mentioned she wants kids soon. That part is confusing. If she's planning to get pregnant, using a condom would prevent pregnancy. Unless she wants to conceive but is not ready yet? But the guy thought she just wanted to \"mess around\" for a while. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. If she wants to get pregnant soon, why use a condom? Or maybe she's on birth control and the guy isn't, so she's okay without a condom. But then why bring up condoms at all?\n\nAlso, the girl's insistence that he use hers might be about control or her comfort. Maybe she's not on birth control and wants to make sure he uses her condom for STI prevention. But in that case, the guy should have his own responsibility. The fact that she made it a deal-breaker if he didn't use hers is a red flag. If someone is pressuring you to not use a condom or to use theirs, that's a sign of possible disrespect for your boundaries. Similarly, if the guy is pressured to not use his own, that's also a problem.\n\nIn terms of consent, both partners should agree on the use of protection. The guy's decision to leave because he wasn't comfortable using a different condom might be justifiable. However, the girl's friend calling him an asshole could indicate that she's the one being unreasonable. But maybe the girl has her own reasons for wanting her condoms. The guy might be in the right here if he's not willing to compromise on his own protection. Using a condom is a personal choice, and neither partner should force the other to use a specific one.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of trust and communication. If the girl wanted to avoid pregnancy, maybe she's on birth control, and the guy is not. If that's the case, using her condom might be unnecessary. However, without clear communication, the guy's hesitation is understandable. The key here is whether using her condom is a health or safety issue. If the guy is worried about STIs and the girl is not using her own for that reason, that's a problem. But if she's on birth control and he's not, maybe she's okay with not using a condom. However, that's a different scenario.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The author left because he wasn't comfortable using her condom, which she insisted on. If the girl is pressuring him to not use a condom, that's a problem. But in this case, she's insisting on using her own, not no condom. The author's mistake might be not understanding why she wanted her own. Alternatively, she might be trying to control the situation. The fact that she made it a deal-breaker if he didn't use hers could be a sign of manipulation or poor communication. The author leaving might have been the right call if he felt uncomfortable. But maybe he should have discussed it more instead of just leaving. It's possible that the girl had valid reasons, like wanting to use her own for STI protection, but the author didn't consider that. However, bringing his own shows he's prepared, so insisting on using hers might be an issue. In terms of responsibility, both should agree on protection. If the author is uncomfortable using her condom, then maybe he's justified in leaving. So the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (B), because he's standing up for his own choice, and the girl's insistence without discussion could be problematic.\n"
