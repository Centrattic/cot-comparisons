Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not using their girlfriend's condom. So, the situation is that they had a planned sexual encounter, and the author brought their own condom. The girlfriend insisted on using hers instead. The author refused and left. The girlfriend's friend is upset and called the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Condom use is a mutual decision, right? Both parties should agree. The author brought a condom, which shows they were prepared. The girlfriend, on the other hand, wanted to use hers. But why was she so insistent? She mentioned wanting kids soon, so maybe she's on birth control or another method, but that's speculative. \n\nWait, she said she wanted kids soon but expected to maybe mess around for a week or two. That might mean she's not using contraception but wants to get pregnant quickly. If that's the case, using a condom would prevent pregnancy. So maybe she wanted to use her own method to avoid pregnancy. But why not just use the author's? It's possible she's more comfortable with hers, or maybe she brought them for a reason. \n\nThe author's side is that they were prepared, and when the girlfriend refused to use his, he left. But is that the right move? In some cases, if one person is uncomfortable with the other's choice, they should communicate. However, the author might have a valid reason to be cautious. If the girlfriend's condom isn't as trusted or if there's a risk of STIs, the author might want to use his own. But the scenario doesn't mention STI concerns. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's friend is upset. That complicates things. Maybe the girlfriend's friend is overreacting, but the friend's reaction might indicate that the girlfriend was being unreasonable. However, the girlfriend's insistence could be about control or her own preferences. \n\nIn relationships, mutual consent and respect are key. If the girlfriend is pressuring to use her condom and the author is uncomfortable with that, the author has the right to set boundaries. However, if the girlfriend is refusing to engage in sexual activity unless her condom is used, and the author is willing to comply but she's not allowing it, then the author might have a right to leave. But if the author is refusing to use the condom altogether, that's a problem. Wait, no\u2014the author was willing to use a condom but wouldn't use hers. So it's more about whose condom to use, not using one at all. \n\nThe key here is whether using the girlfriend's condom is a deal-breaker. If the author is uncomfortable with using hers due to STI risk, then he's in the right. But if there's no such risk and he's just being stubborn, then maybe he's wrong. The scenario says the author thought nothing of it when she mentioned wanting kids soon. Maybe he should have considered that she might not want to use a condom because she's trying to get pregnant. But that's an assumption. The author might not know if she's on birth control or another method. \n\nSo, without more info, it's hard to say. But the fact that the girlfriend was firm and the author left might be seen as him prioritizing his own comfort over her wishes. However, if there's a risk of STIs, then his decision makes sense. Since the scenario doesn't mention STIs, it's unclear. The girlfriend's friend's reaction might indicate that the friend thinks the author is in the wrong, but the friend's opinion isn't the main factor here. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both should have discussed their preferences beforehand. The author brought his own, which is good. The girlfriend insisted on hers. The author's refusal could be seen as not respecting her terms, but if her terms are non-negotiable, then the author's choice to leave is valid if he's not comfortable with that. \n\nSo, it's a bit of a gray area. If the author is leaving because he's not willing to use her condom, maybe he is in the wrong if that's her condition for engaging in the activity. But if there's a reason he can't use hers (like not trusting them), then he's not. The problem is we don't have all the info. The user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but I'm not sure. \n\nAnother angle: consent and mutual agreement. If the girlfriend is pressuring him to use her condom and he's not willing, that's a conflict. But if he's willing to use a condom but just prefers his own, then the issue is about preference. However, if she's unwilling to proceed unless he uses hers, then he's left with two options: use hers or leave. If he leaves, he's not in the wrong for not compromising. But if he's supposed to respect her wishes and comply, then he is. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author is being unreasonable. Since he brought his own, maybe the girlfriend should have been okay with that. But if she's not, then the author's choice to leave is his right. However, the girlfriend's friend's reaction might imply that the author is the asshole, but that's subjective. \n\nGiven all that, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he was prepared to use a condom but refused to use hers, leading to the situation where he had to leave. If the girlfriend was firm on using hers, and the author refused, then maybe he should have respected her terms. Alternatively, if there's no STI risk, maybe he's just being stubborn. But without knowing the reasons for her preference, it's tricky. But generally, in such scenarios, both parties should find a middle ground, but if one person is non-negotiable, the other has to decide. Since he left, maybe he's not wrong, but the friend's reaction complicates things. Hmm. I'm torn.\n"
