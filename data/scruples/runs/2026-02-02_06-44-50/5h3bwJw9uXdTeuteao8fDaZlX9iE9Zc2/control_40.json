Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that he went over to his girlfriend after a few weeks of dating, planning to have sex. He brought his own condom, but she insisted on using hers, even to the point of threatening to stop if he didn't. He ended up not using a condom and left, and now he's doubting whether he made a mistake.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The user has been in a relationship for 3-4 weeks. He brought a condom, which is responsible. She wanted to use hers, which she had mentioned before, but he didn't know she wanted to start trying to get pregnant so soon. She became very persistent and even made him leave by refusing to continue. Now he's wondering if he was wrong for not using her condom.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. Both partners should discuss their expectations and boundaries regarding contraception and pregnancy. She mentioned wanting kids soon, but he didn't take that into account when preparing a condom. That's a communication gap. However, he did bring his own, which is a good step. \n\nThe problem arises when she insists on using her own condom and he complies but then there's a conflict. But in the end, he didn't use a condom, which could lead to pregnancy if she's not on birth control. However, the fact that she wanted to get pregnant soon might mean she's not using other methods, so he might have been aware of that. But he didn't seem to realize the urgency of her desire to conceive, which could be a fault in communication from both sides.\n\nThe user is conflicted because he thought she just wanted to \"mess around,\" but she actually wanted to start trying for pregnancy. This mismatch in expectations could be a problem. However, in terms of consent and the situation, she was the one who set the boundary of using her condom, and he didn't follow through. If he was uncomfortable with her condom, he should have discussed it before deciding to not use any. But since he didn't, and he ended up not using a condom despite her insistence, that could be seen as not respecting her boundary.\n\nAlternatively, if he didn't know she wanted to get pregnant so soon, maybe he should have asked more about her plans. But since she mentioned wanting kids soon earlier, he might have been negligent in not checking in on that. However, the immediate issue is that during the encounter, he was supposed to use her condom but refused, leading to unprotected sex. That's a breach of the agreed-upon method of protection, which is her choice. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, bringing your own condom is a good practice, but if the other person has different preferences, it's important to communicate and compromise. The user didn't compromise and ended up not using any, which could lead to unintended consequences. So, he might be in the wrong for not respecting her preference and for not ensuring protection, especially if she was not on birth control and was planning to conceive, which could mean she's taking risks he's not comfortable with.\n\nOn the other hand, if she was planning to get pregnant, maybe she should have been clear that she's not using contraception, and he should have been aware. But the key point is that during the act, he didn't use her condom as she wanted. So, he didn't respect her boundary, which is a problem. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he didn't follow through with her request and didn't use a condom, which could lead to pregnancy or other issues. However, there's also a communication issue on both sides. But the immediate action of not using the condom when she said to use hers is a clear breach, making him at fault.\n"
