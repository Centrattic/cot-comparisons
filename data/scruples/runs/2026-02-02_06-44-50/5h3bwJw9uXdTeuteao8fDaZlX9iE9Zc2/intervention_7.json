Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who brought his own condom, but his girlfriend insisted on using hers. He didn't use a condom and left when she made it a deal-breaker. The question is whether he's at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The guy had his own condom ready. The girlfriend said not to use his and insisted on using hers. He tried to use his, she was persistent, said he should leave if he didn't use hers. He left, and now her friend is upset, so he's getting second thoughts.\n\nFrom a health and safety perspective, using a condom is important for STI prevention. If the girlfriend is the one who's pushing against using a condom, maybe she's not being responsible. However, the guy had his own, so why was she pushing him to use hers? Maybe she didn't want to use a condom at all or had her own reasons. But in the scenario, she made it a non-negotiable, leading the guy to leave.\n\nThe guy's argument is that he didn't use a condom because she refused his. But in that case, he wasn't using any. If he's not comfortable with not using a condom, then maybe he was right to leave. However, if the relationship is such that using a condom is a given, then not using one might be risky. But the girlfriend's behavior seems controlling here, making it a condition to use her condom instead of his.\n\nBut the question is about who's in the wrong. The guy didn't use a condom, which could be a problem if he's not on the same page. However, the girlfriend's insistence on using her own might be manipulative. If she's the one who's pushing for no condom, he's protecting himself by leaving. Alternatively, maybe he should have compromised, but she wouldn't let him use his. So he had to choose between using none or none. If he left, then he's not at fault. But if he went ahead without a condom, that's different.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong. But maybe he's not. Because if he had his own and she refused, he left, which is a responsible choice. However, if he had sex without a condom despite her insistence, that's a problem. But in this case, he didn't. He left. So maybe he's not at fault. Alternatively, maybe he should have used her condom if it was necessary. But why would he use hers if he had his own? If she's the one not wanting to use a condom, then his choice to leave is justified. So the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
