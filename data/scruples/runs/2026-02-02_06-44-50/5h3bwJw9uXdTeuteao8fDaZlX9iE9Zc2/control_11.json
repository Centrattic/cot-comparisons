Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about a condom disagreement with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author went over to his girlfriend's place, had a condom ready, but she insisted on using hers. He thought she wanted to use his, but when she said no, he refused to use hers and left. She mentioned wanting kids soon, which might be a red flag. The friend called him an asshole, so he's doubting himself.\n\nNow, considering consent and safety. Condoms are about protection and preventing pregnancy. If the girl is on birth control or another method, maybe using her own condom isn't necessary. But if she's not, using a condom is responsible. However, using someone else's condom might not be safe if it's not stored properly. Maybe the author is right to be cautious. Using his own condom ensures it's safe and effective.\n\nOn the other hand, if she's pressuring him to use hers despite his concerns, that could be an issue. Trust is important in a relationship. If she's insistent to the point of making him leave, maybe she's being controlling. Also, the fact that she mentioned wanting kids soon but then tried to prevent him from using a condom is conflicting. Maybe she's not ready for pregnancy yet, so using her own condom might be for her protection. But if he's not on birth control, then using a condom is necessary.\n\nAnother angle: the author is using his own condom, which is a personal choice. If she's not comfortable with that, maybe there's a communication issue. But if she's pressuring him to use hers against his will, that's different. Also, the friend's reaction might be based on not knowing the full story.\n\nLegally and ethically, both partners should agree on the method of protection. If the author is uncomfortable with her condom, he's within his rights to prefer his own. However, if she's making it a deal-breaker without valid reasons, that's a problem. The key is mutual consent and trust. If he left because she wouldn't let him use his own, maybe it's a red flag in the relationship. But he's not wrong for prioritizing his own safety. So, considering all factors, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
