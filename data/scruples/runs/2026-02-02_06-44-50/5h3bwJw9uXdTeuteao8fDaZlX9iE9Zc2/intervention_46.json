Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who went over to his girlfriend and wanted to use his own condom, but she insisted on using hers. He thought she might want to get pregnant soon but didn't take it seriously. He ended up leaving because she wouldn't let him use his condom, and now he's unsure if he made the right choice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The woman is insisting on using her own condom, which might be because she's on contraception or maybe she prefers her own. However, the man had his own and was ready to use it. She refused and even made him leave if he didn't use hers. He later received a friend's message calling him an asshole. \n\nNow, in terms of consent and safety, using a condom is a mutual decision. If both parties agree, using a condom is a safe choice. But in this case, the woman is the one who set the condition that they can only proceed if they use her condom. The guy, on the other hand, was prepared with his own and was willing to use it but she wouldn't allow it. \n\nWait, but the woman mentioned she wants kids soon. Maybe she's using this as an excuse to not use a condom? Or maybe she's using her own for a different reason. However, if she's using her own condom, does that mean she's not on another form of birth control? If she's not, then using her own condom is necessary for her, but if she is, maybe she's trying to avoid pregnancy even if they want kids later. The man might be right to want to use a condom if she's not ready for pregnancy. But he thought she was okay with maybe just messing around. \n\nBut the main issue here is who is at fault. The woman is the one who set the condition and refused to proceed if he used his own. The man left, which might be his way of standing his ground. However, if she's not on another form of birth control, using her own condom might be necessary. Alternatively, if she's on the pill or another method, maybe she's not in the wrong here. \n\nBut the problem is the dynamic here. The woman is the one who is making the decision about the condom. In a healthy relationship, both partners should agree on the use of protection. If one person is insistent and the other is willing to comply, it might not be a problem. But if the woman is pressuring the man to use her condom and he's okay with that, then it's a mutual agreement. Wait, in this case, the man was prepared to use his own, but the woman refused. He then left, which could be his way of saying he won't compromise on using protection. However, the woman is now saying that he's an asshole. \n\nWait, the user is asking if the author is wrong for not using the woman's condom. The author did not use her condom; he left instead. So the question is whether leaving was the right choice or if he should have gone along with her condom. \n\nIf the woman is the one who is more comfortable using her own, maybe the man should respect that. But if he was uncomfortable with that, then he has a right to not proceed. But in this scenario, he had his own and was ready to use it, but she refused. So maybe he's in the right because he was prepared to use protection, but she was insistent on her own. However, in a relationship, mutual consent is key. If she's the one who's not allowing him to use his own, but he's okay with using hers, maybe he should have gone along. \n\nBut if he's not comfortable with that, then he's not wrong to leave. The problem is that the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not using the woman's condom. The answer depends on whether using her condom was necessary. If she's not on other birth control, then using her condom is necessary. If he's not on any, then using a condom is necessary. But if they both agree to use protection, the choice of whose to use shouldn't matter. However, in this case, the woman is the one who is more insistent, and the man is standing his ground. \n\nSo, maybe the author is not in the wrong because he was respecting his own preparedness and the woman's insistence on using hers might be an issue. Alternatively, the woman might have her reasons, but if she's pressuring him to use her condom despite him having his own, maybe she's the one being unreasonable. \n\nBut in the end, the man left, which could be seen as standing up for himself. However, if the woman's main concern was protection, then using her condom is necessary. If he's not using any, then he's in the wrong. But the man had his own, so he was prepared. The woman refused, so the man left. Maybe the woman is in the wrong for pressuring him not to use his own, but the man is not in the wrong for leaving. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the man should have gone with her condom since she was insistent. But if he's uncomfortable with that, then it's a mutual issue. This is a bit tricky. I think the answer is that the author is not in the wrong (B) because he was prepared to use protection and the woman's refusal might be an issue. However, if the woman is the one who set the condition and he left, maybe he's not wrong. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me check again.\n\nThe key points: The woman said she won't proceed unless they use hers. The man had his own and was ready but she refused. He left. She mentioned wanting kids soon, but maybe that was a red herring. If she wants kids soon, why require a condom? Maybe she's lying about wanting kids and is actually trying to avoid pregnancy. If that's the case, the man is right to use a condom. But the woman is pressuring him to use hers. If the man is okay with using hers, then he's in the right. But he left instead of using hers. Wait, he didn't use hers because she was making him. So maybe he's not wrong. \n\nWait, the man had his own and was about to use it. She refused and said they can't proceed unless they use hers. He left. So he didn't use any condom. But he had his own. The woman's friend is calling him an asshole for not using hers. But the man was prepared to use his own, which is a valid choice. However, the woman insisted on using hers. If the man is okay with using hers, then he should comply. If not, then he's okay to leave. So if the man is okay with using her condom, then he's in the wrong for not using it and leaving. But he's not in the wrong if he's uncomfortable with that. \n\nBut in the situation, he had his own and was ready to use it. So maybe the woman is being unreasonable. The man's choice to leave is his right. So he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
