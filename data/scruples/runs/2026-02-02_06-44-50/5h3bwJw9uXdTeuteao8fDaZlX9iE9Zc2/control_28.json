Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author did the right thing here. So, the situation is that the author went over to his girlfriend's place, and they were about to have sex. He brought his own condom, but she insisted on using hers. He tried to use his, but she wouldn't allow it and even made him leave when he didn't comply. Now he's wondering if he was wrong to not use her condom and left the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points here. The key issue is consent and mutual agreement on using protection. Both parties should feel comfortable and safe. The author brought his own condom, which is responsible. However, the girlfriend wanted to use hers. But why would she have a problem with his condom? Maybe there's an underlying reason, like STI prevention or pregnancy concerns. Wait, the author mentioned she mentioned wanting kids soon, but he thought they'd just mess around for a week or two. That's conflicting. If she wants kids soon, maybe she doesn't need a condom, but the author might be worried about pregnancy. But if she's pushing her own condom, maybe she's also concerned about STIs. \n\nBut why wouldn't she accept his? Maybe she doesn't trust his condoms, or there's a personal preference. However, in a consensual relationship, both should agree on the terms. The author tried to use his condom, but she refused and even made him leave. Then her friend called him an asshole. The author left, but now he's questioning if he should have gone along with her. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the key is mutual consent. If she's pressuring him to use her condom, but he's not comfortable with that, is he in the wrong for not complying? Or is she in the wrong for not allowing him to use his own? \n\nFrom a health perspective, using a condom is important for STI prevention. If they're not in a monogamous relationship or have other partners, using a condom is necessary. However, if they're both monogamous and she's on birth control, maybe she's okay without it. But the author might be concerned about her STI status. \n\nBut the situation here is that she's insisting on her own condom, which might be about control or trust issues. The author's choice to leave because he wasn't comfortable with her condom could be seen as standing up for his boundaries. However, if he's willing to use her condom, then using hers instead of his own isn't inherently a problem. But if he's not comfortable with that, he's not wrong for leaving. \n\nHowever, the fact that she mentioned wanting kids soon but then insists on using a condom is confusing. Maybe she's not ready to get pregnant yet but wants to have sex. The author might be confused about her intentions. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's mistake could be not discussing this more before the situation arose. If he's uncomfortable with using her condom, then walking away is his right. But if the issue is about mutual agreement, then both should agree on the terms. However, the girlfriend's insistence on her condom and the friend's reaction might indicate a cultural or personal norm issue. \n\nIn terms of consent, if she's pressuring him and he doesn't feel comfortable, he's not wrong for not complying. However, the fact that she said she wouldn't let him have sex unless he used her condom might be a form of coercion. If someone is pressuring another to not use protection they brought, that's a red flag. So, the author might be in the right for not complying because it's about his consent and health. \n\nBut on the other hand, if the reason she's insisting on her condom is for mutual benefit (like STI protection), then the author's refusal could be a problem. However, without knowing her reasons, it's hard to judge. The key point is mutual consent and communication. The author should have discussed this earlier rather than during the moment. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong because he's asserting his own boundaries regarding protection. However, the situation is complicated by the girlfriend's conflicting statements about wanting kids soon but insisting on using a condom. The author's decision to leave when he felt uncomfortable is his right. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
