Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a guy who went to his girlfriend's place with a condom he brought, but she refused to use it and made him leave. He's wondering if he did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and boundaries. Condoms are about safety and mutual agreement. The girl wanted to use her own, maybe for her own reasons, like if she had specific preferences or maybe she's on birth control and didn't need a condom. But the guy was insistent on using his. However, when she said she wouldn't proceed unless he used hers, he left. \n\nNow, the key points here are: Did he have a valid reason to refuse her condom? If she mentioned wanting kids soon, maybe she's not on birth control or wants to conceive, but that's not necessarily relevant if they're not trying to get pregnant yet. But if she's using protection, maybe she's on the pill or another method. However, condoms also protect against STIs, which is important if either isn't tested or isn't in a monogamous relationship.\n\nThe guy brought his own condom, which is responsible. But when she refused to use it and insisted on hers, he was willing to leave. The question is whether he overstepped by not using her condom. If she's comfortable with not using a condom, but he's not, that's a different scenario. But here, she was the one who wanted to use her own, perhaps for safety. \n\nWait, but the girl said she had some, but he already had one. Maybe she wanted to use a specific type, or maybe she's on birth control and doesn't need a condom but wants to use her own for some reason. However, if the guy is concerned about STIs, he might be right to use his own. But if she's trusting her own, maybe she's confident in their STI status. However, mutual testing isn't mentioned here.\n\nThe guy ended up leaving because she refused his condom and insisted on hers. But by not using her condom, he didn't use any protection, which could be risky. However, if he was uncomfortable using her condom for legitimate reasons (like not knowing her STI status), he has a point. But the problem is that he didn't use a condom at all, which could lead to unintended pregnancy or STIs if they aren't both on the same page.\n\nBut the girl wanted to use her own, and he refused, leading to a conflict. The guy's choice to leave might be his right if he feels uncomfortable. However, if the issue is about consent and mutual agreement, the girl's refusal to use his condom and insisting on hers might be a deal-breaker for him. But if the reason he left was because he wanted to use a condom and she didn't, he might be in the right to prioritize his own safety. However, in the scenario, the girl was the one pushing for her own condom, which could indicate she's okay with using protection, but maybe the guy was reluctant. Wait, the user says he was going to use his own, but she wanted to use hers. He used his own, but she made him leave. Wait, no, the user says he was going to use his own, but she refused that and wanted hers. So he didn't use a condom at all and left. \n\nWait, the user's situation is that he had a condom and was about to use it, but the girl refused and wanted to use her own. He didn't use hers, left, and now is questioning if he was wrong. The girl might have felt that not using her condom was a deal-breaker because she wanted to use protection. If the guy was okay with using hers, they could have proceeded. But since he didn't, maybe he's in the wrong for not compromising. Alternatively, if he had reservations about using her condom (like maybe he didn't trust it or wasn't sure about her STI status), he's justified in leaving. But the problem is that he didn't use any protection, which could be risky. \n\nAnother angle: The girl's friend called him an asshole, which might indicate social pressure on him. But personal boundaries are important. If the guy isn't comfortable using her condom, he's not obligated to. However, if the girl is insistent on using protection and he refuses, he's not respecting her wishes. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both should communicate. If the guy wanted to use a condom and she wanted to use hers, maybe they could have used both (double protection), but that's not common. Alternatively, the guy could have compromised and used her condom if he trusted her, or if he didn't, he should have stood his ground. \n\nBut the main issue is that he didn't use a condom at all, which could lead to unintended consequences. However, if the girl was okay with not using a condom but insisted on hers, maybe there's a misunderstanding. The guy's choice to leave might be his right, but if the girl's main concern was protection, he's not respecting her wishes by not using any. \n\nSo considering all that, maybe the guy is in the wrong because he didn't use any protection when she wanted to use hers. But he could argue that he had his own for a reason. It's a tough call. But since he ended up not using a condom at all, and she wanted to use protection, he might be in the wrong for not compromising. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, he's in the wrong). But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if he had legitimate safety concerns, he's not in the wrong. The question is whether the author is wrong for not using the girl's condom. If the girl wanted to use it for her own reasons, not using it could be a problem. So maybe A.\n"
