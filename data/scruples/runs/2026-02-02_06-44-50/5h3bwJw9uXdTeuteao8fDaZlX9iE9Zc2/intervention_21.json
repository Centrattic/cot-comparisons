Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The situation involves a guy who had a condom ready, but his girlfriend wanted to use hers instead. He refused, left, and now feels conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The girl mentioned wanting kids soon, so maybe she's on birth control or using a specific type of condom. But the main issue is about using her own condom. The guy brought his own, but she insisted on hers. He refused and left. Now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nFrom a general perspective, condoms are a mutual decision. Both partners should agree on their use. If the girl is okay with using her own, but the guy is uncomfortable with that, maybe there's a communication problem. But the guy had his own, and he's the one who's supposed to use it. Wait, no\u2014actually, the correct procedure is that the person using the condom should use the one they've brought, unless there's a mutual agreement to use the partner's. But in this case, the guy was prepared and had his own. The girl is refusing to use his, insisting on hers. \n\nBut why? If she wants to use hers, maybe she has a reason, like a preference for a certain type. But the guy had already brought his. The problem here is that the guy is being asked to use a condom that he didn't bring. Is that a red flag? If he's uncomfortable using a condom that's not his, that's a valid concern. Because if she insists on using hers, maybe he's worried about her using a used one or not having it properly stored. But since she had hers, maybe she didn't mention anything about that. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy had his own, so why not use his? The girl is making a big deal about using hers. The guy is saying he's prepared, but she's refusing. If the girl is pressuring him to use hers, maybe there's an issue with control or not respecting his preparedness. \n\nBut in terms of consent and mutual agreement, both should agree on the method. If the guy is okay using hers, then it's fine. But if he's uncomfortable, he has the right to say no. However, the fact that he had his own but she insisted on hers might lead to conflict. Also, the girl then said he couldn't proceed unless he uses hers, which sounds like a manipulation tactic. \n\nThe guy's decision to leave might seem abrupt, but it's his right to not compromise on something he's uncomfortable with. However, he didn't try to discuss it further or ask why she wanted to use hers. Maybe there's a misunderstanding. \n\nIn terms of responsibility for STIs or pregnancy, if they're both in a committed relationship and using protection, it's important. If the girl is using birth control, maybe she's not worried about pregnancy, but the guy might still want to use a condom for STI prevention. \n\nThe guy's argument here is that he was prepared, but she's making a big deal about using hers. The girl's insistence might indicate that she's not comfortable with his preparedness, which is confusing. \n\nIn conclusion, the guy isn't necessarily in the wrong if he's uncomfortable using a condom he didn't bring. However, the situation could have been handled better with more communication. The girl's insistence on using hers without discussing the reasons might be problematic. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
