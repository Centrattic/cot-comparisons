Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple about to have sex, and there's a conflict over which condom to use. The guy brought his own, but the girlfriend insists on using hers. He refuses, leaves, and now he's questioning if he was right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend mentioned wanting kids soon, but the guy thought they'd just mess around for a while. She insists on using her condom, and when he doesn't comply, she tells him to leave. He leaves, and then her friend calls him an asshole. Now he's unsure.\n\nCondom use is a significant issue. The main thing here is mutual consent and communication. If the girlfriend is insistent on using her own condom, maybe she has reasons. But the guy had his own. Why does it matter which condom is used? Condoms are a safety measure for both STI prevention and pregnancy. If the woman is the one who wants children soon, maybe she's not on birth control, so using a condom is important. But why does she want to use hers? Maybe she's concerned about brand, or maybe she has a different reason. \n\nHowever, the guy had already brought his own. If the issue is about who brings it, that's trivial. The important thing is that both parties agree on using a condom. If she's refusing because she wants to get pregnant, that's a different scenario. But if she's using her own for safety reasons, then insisting on using hers isn't necessarily wrong. However, the guy's refusal to use her condom might be a problem if she's not on birth control and they don't want pregnancy yet. \n\nBut wait, the girlfriend said they might mess around for a week or two, and she wants kids soon. So maybe she's not on birth control and wants to conceive. In that case, using a condom would prevent pregnancy. So if the guy is okay with not using a condom, but she's insistent on using one, maybe there's a misunderstanding. However, the guy had his own, perhaps he's concerned about STIs, while she might not be. \n\nBut the main issue is consent. If she says she won't have sex unless he uses her condom, and he refuses, then he's not having sex without consent. But the problem here is that the guy is the one who left. So he didn't proceed without consent. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong for not using his own condom. \n\nCondom use should be mutual. If she's insistent on using her own, and he refuses, he might be disregarding her boundaries. But if she's using the condom for her own safety (like STI prevention), then using hers is the same as his. The brand shouldn't matter. Maybe the issue is about control. The guy's refusal could be seen as not respecting her decision. \n\nAlternatively, if the woman is using the condom to prevent pregnancy, but the guy is okay with it, then there's a conflict in their intentions. However, in that case, she should have discussed her birth control status. If she's not on birth control and wants to get pregnant soon, using a condom would prevent that. So maybe the guy is in the right if they had agreed not to use a condom, but she changed her mind. \n\nBut the scenario is a bit unclear. The key points are mutual consent and understanding each other's needs. If the woman is insistent on using a condom for health or pregnancy prevention, and the guy refuses, that could be a problem. But if she's insistent on using her own for no valid reason, maybe it's a control issue. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both partners should communicate their needs. The guy brought his own, which shows he's prepared, but she wants to use hers. The problem is that he didn't comply. If she's not on birth control, using a condom is necessary for her to avoid pregnancy. If he's okay with not using one, that's a problem. But if they had discussed this before, maybe there's a misunderstanding. \n\nIn summary, if the woman is using the condom to prevent pregnancy and the guy is not respecting that, then he's in the wrong. However, if the issue is about which condom to use without a valid reason, then maybe not. The key is whether there was a mutual agreement on condom use. If she's insistent on using a condom, and he refuses, he's not respecting her boundaries, making him in the wrong. Therefore, answer A.\n"
