Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author brought a condom, but the girlfriend insisted on using hers. He thought she wanted to get pregnant soon, but maybe they were just going to \"mess around\" for a while. The author didn't want to use the girl's condom and ended up leaving. Now the friend called him an asshole, and he's wondering if he made a mistake.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement in sexual situations. Using a condom is a personal choice, but when it comes to sexual activity, both parties should agree on the precautions. The girl said she wouldn't proceed unless he used hers. The author had his own, but she was persistent and even said to leave if he didn't use hers. \n\nWait, but maybe the issue is about respecting her boundaries? If she's saying no to his condom and is insistent on using hers, maybe he should comply. But why is she insistent? She mentioned wanting kids soon, but maybe she already has a method or another form of protection. Or perhaps she doesn't want to use a condom at all. \n\nHowever, using a condom is a form of protection for both partners. If he's not on the same page about protection, then it's a problem. But since he came prepared, maybe he's concerned about STIs. If she's not using her own for some reason, maybe she's not in a monogamous relationship or has other health concerns. \n\nBut in this case, the author refused to use her condom and left instead. The friend called him an asshole, which might suggest that the girlfriend expected him to go along with her choice. So, is the author wrong for not using her condom? If she's insistent and he's not willing to compromise, then maybe he's not respecting her wishes. But if he's uncomfortable using her condom for safety reasons, that's a different angle. \n\nWait, the key point here is consent. If she said she wouldn't proceed unless he uses hers, and he refused, then he was respecting his own boundaries. But if he went along, he might be compromising his own safety. But using a condom is a mutual decision. If she's not using her own, maybe she's not using any, which could be a problem. \n\nBut the author thought she wanted to use hers, so maybe she actually had a condom, which would be safe. If he was insistent on using his own, maybe the issue is about control or not trusting her. But in consensual situations, both parties should be comfortable. If she's pressuring him to use hers and he refuses, is that a problem? It depends on the context. If she's not using a condom at all, then he's right to refuse. But if she's using her own, and he's okay with that, then maybe he's being too rigid. \n\nWait, the friend called him an asshole, which implies that the girlfriend's side is being supported. But the author left when she said no, so maybe he's standing up for his own needs. But if the girlfriend was willing to proceed with her own condom, then refusing to use it might be disrespectful. However, using a different condom isn't a problem. \n\nAnother angle: The author had his own, which he was prepared to use. The girl wanted to use hers. Maybe he's just being cautious. But if she's insistent and he leaves, maybe he's overreacting. The friend's reaction suggests that the girl's side is more about control. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. The core issue is whether respecting personal boundaries (using his own condom) or respecting her choice (using hers) is more important. If the girl is in a position where she's not using a condom at all, then he's right to refuse. But if she's using her own, it's about mutual agreement. \n\nBut the author left when she said no. In a consensual situation, both parties should be comfortable. If he's uncomfortable using her condom, maybe there's a reason to be cautious. However, once she said she wouldn't proceed unless he uses hers, and he refused, then he was respecting his own boundaries. \n\nBut if she had her own condom and he was just being stubborn, then maybe he's in the wrong. However, the fact that he had already brought his own might indicate that he's prepared, and using his own is safer for him. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is that she's not using a condom at all. If she's saying she has some, but refuses to use them, then the author is right to leave. But if she's using her own condom, then it's okay. The scenario is unclear. The author mentions she said \"no no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\" but then insists on using hers. Maybe she meant she has other methods of protection, like birth control, and doesn't want to use a condom. But the author is concerned about STIs, so he wants to use his own. \n\nIn that case, the author's decision to leave might be about protecting his own health. However, if the girl is on birth control and not concerned about STIs, maybe he's being too cautious. But without knowing each other's STI statuses, it's risky to not use a condom. \n\nSo, if the author is in a situation where he's not sure about her STI status, then using his own condom is the safer choice. By refusing to use hers, he's protecting himself. But she's pressuring him to use hers, possibly because she doesn't want to use any. In that case, he's right to leave. \n\nBut the friend called him an asshole, which might mean that the girlfriend's side is being supported. However, the friend's opinion isn't necessarily the right one. \n\nConsidering all this, the author might be in the right by not using her condom if he's concerned about safety and she's not using any. But if she's using her own, then he's being stubborn. The scenario is a bit ambiguous. \n\nGiven that the author left when she said to, and he was respecting his own boundaries, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if she was actually okay to use a condom (hers), then he's being inflexible. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong because he's protecting his own health and boundaries. However, it's a gray area. But based on the information, he had his own and she was pressuring him to not use it. If she's not using any protection, he's right to refuse.\n"
