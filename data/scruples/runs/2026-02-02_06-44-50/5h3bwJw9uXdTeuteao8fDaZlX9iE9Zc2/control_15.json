Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The key points here are about condom use and consent.\n\nFirst, the guy brought his own condom, which is responsible. But the girl refused to use it and insisted on using hers. She even said she wouldn't proceed unless they used hers, and later, her friend called him an asshole. The guy left because he didn't want to compromise his own comfort with her condom, maybe due to concerns about STIs or not trusting her. \n\nNow, in terms of right or wrong. Condom use is a personal health and safety issue. Both parties have the right to negotiate terms they're comfortable with. If the guy wasn't okay with using her condom because he's not sure about her STI status, then he's not in the wrong for prioritizing his health. She has the right to set her own boundaries, like not wanting to use his condom, but he also has the right to leave if he's uncomfortable. \n\nBut there's another angle: if they were considering having kids soon, maybe she's on birth control, but that's not the same as STI protection. The guy might be worried about risks. However, the situation escalated because she refused to use his condom, leading him to leave. Her friend's reaction might be judgmental, but that's her friend's issue. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, neither is necessarily wrong. The guy did what he felt was necessary for his safety, and she set her own boundaries. The conflict is about differing priorities. The guy isn't in the wrong for standing by his decision. The answer should be B.\n"
