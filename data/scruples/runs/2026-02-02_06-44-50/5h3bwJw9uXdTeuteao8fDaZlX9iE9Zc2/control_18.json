Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong when they refused to use the girlfriend's condom instead of their own.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the scenario. The author went over to his girlfriend's place and had a condom ready. When they were about to have sex, the girlfriend said she had her own and insisted on using hers. The author tried to use his, but she was firm and even said she wouldn't allow it unless they used hers. He ended up leaving, and now his girlfriend's friend is upset, calling him an asshole. He's now questioning if he should have gone along with her choice.\n\nThe key points here are consent, communication, and the use of contraception. The girlfriend wanted to use her own condom, possibly because she mentioned wanting to have kids soon. Maybe she wanted to track her own birth control or ensure she was using her preferred brand. The author had brought a condom, but the girlfriend was insistent on using hers. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author did have a condom, which shows he was responsible. However, the girlfriend's insistence suggests that she had a reason to prefer her own. If she was already using birth control or had another method, maybe she didn't need the condom, but that's not stated. If the issue was about her wanting to get pregnant soon, then using a condom would prevent that. The author might not have known her plans, so his refusal could be seen as not respecting her autonomy or her stated desires.\n\nBut wait, the girlfriend's actions here seem a bit controlling. She made it a deal-breaker that they had to use her condom, which the author found uncomfortable. The friend's reaction might be adding pressure here. The author left because he was uncomfortable, which is his right, but maybe the way he handled it could be questioned. However, standing up for his own preparedness and safety could be his priority.\n\nThe main question is about consent and mutual agreement. If both parties agree on the method of contraception, that's good. But in this case, the girlfriend overruled the author's choice. The author might have a right to use his own condom, but if she's insisting on hers for medical or personal reasons, then using hers is necessary. However, the author might not have been aware of that. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both should communicate. If the author had asked why she wanted to use hers, maybe there was a reason. But he might not have known. The fact that she was insistent and even made it a condition to continue shows she valued her choice highly. The author leaving might be his way of standing his ground, but maybe he should have discussed it more instead of walking out.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends. If the girlfriend had a valid reason (like medical or fertility tracking) and the author was aware, then using his own could be an issue. But if he was unaware and she didn't explain, maybe he's not wrong. However, the act of bringing his own condom shows he was responsible, but respecting her choice is also important. The friend's reaction might be overblown, but the author's decision to leave could be seen as not respecting her wishes. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might be at fault for not considering her perspective more and not finding a compromise. But if she was being unreasonable, then he's not in the wrong. The key is whether her insistence was reasonable and if communication was lacking. Since the author didn't know her reason for wanting to use hers, maybe he's not in the wrong, but he could have handled it better.\n"
