Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple using a condom, but there's a conflict over whose condom to use.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author brought his own condom, started to use it, but the girlfriend refused and insisted on using hers. She even threatened to end the encounter if he didn't use hers. The author left, and now he's wondering if he was wrong to do so.\n\nSo, the main issue here is consent and control over sexual health decisions. Using a condom is a personal choice, and both partners should agree on its use. However, the girlfriend is asserting her preference here. But the author is concerned about her possible pregnancy plans conflicting with condom use. Wait, she mentioned wanting kids soon, which might mean she's not using contraception, but the author is concerned about using his own condom. Hmm, maybe there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nThe author's reasoning for not using her condom might be related to his own health concerns or preferences. But the problem is that the girlfriend is refusing his condom, which could be a red flag. If someone is pressuring the other to stop using protection, that's a serious issue, especially if there's a risk of STIs or unintended pregnancy. The author might be in the right because he's prioritizing his own safety by not using an unknown condom. But if the girlfriend is insistent and he refuses, he's also standing his ground.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's insistence could be about trust or her own health. If she's using her own condoms, she might have a reason, like not trusting his supply or her own medical needs. However, if she's against using any condom despite the author's concerns, that's a conflict. But the author's decision to leave might be a valid choice to protect himself.\n\nThe friend's reaction (calling him an asshole) complicates things. Maybe the girlfriend's side is seeing the author's refusal as disrespectful. But in terms of right and wrong, the author is making a personal health decision. Using protection is a standard practice, and if one partner is insistent on not using it despite the other's concerns, that's a problem. The author's choice to leave might be a responsible action rather than a wrong one.\n\nIn sexual health, both partners should agree on the use of protection. If one is uncomfortable with the other's method, they should discuss it. The author's refusal to use her condom because he brought his own is a valid stance for protecting his health. However, the girlfriend's refusal to use his might indicate a lack of respect for his boundaries. The author didn't force the situation and left when she was insistent, which could be seen as a reasonable response to a conflict of wills.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's prioritizing his own safety and health, which is important. The girlfriend's behavior is concerning if she's pressuring him to not use protection, especially if she's not clear about her own intentions regarding pregnancy and health. The author's decision to leave, while maybe awkward, is a responsible choice.\n"
