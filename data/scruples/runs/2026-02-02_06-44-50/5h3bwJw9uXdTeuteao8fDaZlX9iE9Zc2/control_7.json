Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a girlfriend who wants to use her own condom, and the author brought his own. The girlfriend insists on using hers, even to the point of refusing to continue otherwise. The author then leaves, and a friend texts him calling him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The woman mentioned she wants to have kids soon, but maybe she's not ready for pregnancy yet. Using her own condom might be a way for her to have control over the situation, maybe to ensure it's the right time. But wait, if she wants to have kids soon, why would she want to use a condom? Maybe she's not ready yet and wants to prevent pregnancy until the right time. Alternatively, maybe she has health reasons or STI concerns. But the author doesn't mention any of that.\n\nThe author brought his own condom, which he intended to use. The girlfriend refused and insisted on hers. The author then left, thinking it was necessary to use his own. But why couldn't he use hers? Is there an issue with using her condom? Maybe there's a trust issue if the condom isn't new or if it's been used before. However, the girlfriend might have had her own reasons for bringing her own, like preferring a certain brand or type. \n\nAnother angle is consent and mutual agreement. In a sexual relationship, both partners should agree on the method of protection. The girlfriend is asserting her preference, and the author is also standing by his. The girlfriend's insistence might be seen as a non-negotiable stance, but the author's refusal to use hers and leaving could be seen as a lack of compromise. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's friend calling the author an asshole might indicate that the situation is being perceived as his fault. But that could be biased. \n\nIn terms of responsibility for STI prevention, both partners should be on the same page. If the author is responsible for his own condom, but the girlfriend is bringing hers, there might be an assumption that she's also responsible for her own protection. However, if the author is the one inserting the condom, using his own makes sense. Maybe the girlfriend wanted to use hers for verification or trust reasons, but the author didn't want to risk using an unknown condom. \n\nThere's also the aspect of communication. The author might not have discussed the importance of using his own condom, and the girlfriend's insistence could be a red flag. However, the girlfriend's mention of wanting kids soon might mean she's not ready for unprotected sex yet, so using a condom is necessary. If she's not ready to remove birth control or stop using condoms, then using hers might be part of her plan. \n\nBut why wouldn't she accept the author's condom? Maybe she's concerned about his STI status, or she wants to ensure the condom is hers for some reason. The author's refusal to use hers could be seen as not respecting her boundaries. However, he might be concerned about using a condom that he didn't bring, especially if he's unsure about its condition. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author is in a relationship where both should be on the same page. However, the girlfriend's insistence on using her own might be about control or trust. The author leaving might be his way of standing his ground, but it could also be seen as not respecting her wishes. \n\nIn many relationships, using a condom is a shared responsibility, and both should agree on the method. If the girlfriend is insistent, there's a chance that she has valid reasons, and the author's refusal could be seen as dismissive. On the other hand, if the author is uncomfortable with using hers without knowing her reasons, that's also a valid concern. \n\nGiven that the girlfriend mentioned wanting kids soon but the author thought they might just \"mess around for a week or two,\" there might be a misunderstanding about their intentions. If the girlfriend is serious about wanting to avoid pregnancy until ready, using a condom is necessary. If the author is not ready to have kids now, using a condom is also necessary. However, the author's decision to leave might be based on mistrust or lack of communication. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions could be seen as not respecting his girlfriend's boundaries by refusing to use her condom, especially if she had a valid reason. However, if the author has concerns about her condom's condition or trust, that's another issue. Without more context, it's hard to say definitively, but in many cases, using the partner's condom is about trust and mutual agreement. Since the girlfriend was firm, the author might be in the wrong by not accommodating her request, leading to the situation where he left and caused conflict. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
