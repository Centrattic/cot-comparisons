Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not using his girlfriend's condom. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe user went to his girlfriend's place and brought his own condom. They were going to have sex, but when he pulled out the condom, she said she had some and insisted they use hers. He tried to use his own, but she wouldn't let him unless he used hers. Then she threatened to make him leave if he didn't. He left, and her friend texted him calling him an asshole. Now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the basic principles here. In a relationship, both partners should have the right to make decisions about their bodies and sexual health. Using a condom is a personal choice, and neither partner should be forced to use a method they're uncomfortable with. The woman is advocating for her own method, which could be for various reasons\u2014maybe she prefers a certain type, or maybe there's something else. However, the key point is consent and mutual agreement.\n\nThe author came prepared with his own condom, which shows he was responsible and thought about protection. When the woman insisted on hers, he was okay with using it initially, but she then became persistent and even threatened to end the encounter. He left, which might be seen as standing up for his own choice, but maybe there's more to it.\n\nWait, she mentioned wanting kids soon. If she wants to conceive, using a condom would prevent that. So maybe she wanted to get pregnant, hence using her own. But the author thought they were just \"messing around for a week or two,\" so he might not have intended to have unprotected sex. That's a conflict in expectations. He might not be ready for pregnancy, while she is.\n\nIn terms of consent, the woman is pushing for her own method, but the author is not willing to comply. If she's making it a deal-breaker that he can't use his own, that's a power dynamic issue. Neither partner should control the other's decisions. However, the author is also not backing down. So the question is, who is wrong here?\n\nIf the woman is pressuring him to use her condoms to get pregnant, but he's not ready, then he's not wrong to leave if he's not comfortable. On the other hand, if he's okay with using her condoms but she's not allowing his, maybe he's being too rigid. But in this case, he was trying to use his own, and she refused. So he left because he wasn't willing to compromise. \n\nAnother angle: the author might be concerned about the quality or source of her condoms. If he brought his own, maybe he's worried about STI protection, but she's not. However, the story doesn't mention STIs. If they're both monogamous and using each other's condoms, that's a mutual risk. If the author is uncomfortable using hers, that's his right. \n\nThe woman's friend calling him an asshole is a red flag. It suggests that the woman's actions might be manipulative or controlling. Insisting on using her condoms and threatening to end the encounter could be a form of coercion. The author left, which is a healthy boundary. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, bringing a condom is a good move. The author is not wrong to prefer using his own for personal reasons, and leaving when pressured is appropriate. The woman's insistence might stem from her own desires (pregnancy), but that doesn't make the author wrong for not complying. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because he's setting a boundary about using his own condom, which is his right. The woman's friend being aggressive also indicates that her actions were problematic. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
