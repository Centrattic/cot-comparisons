Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend and a condom.\n\nSo, the author went to see his girlfriend, and they were about to have sex. He brought his own condom, but she insisted on using hers, even to the point of threatening to end things if he didn't. He ended up leaving, but her friend called him an asshole. Now he's wondering if he did the wrong thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girlfriend wanted to use her own condom. The author was okay with using his own. She was insistent, even making it a deal-breaker. He left instead of complying. The friend is upset, but is the author actually in the wrong?\n\nCondom use is a personal choice and a safety issue. Both partners should have a say in what they're comfortable with. If one partner is insistent on using their own, maybe there's a reason\u2014like maybe she prefers a specific type, or she wants to ensure it's hers for some reason. However, the author was prepared with his own, and she's the one who suddenly changed the terms. \n\nBut here's the thing: it's important for both partners to agree on safe sex practices. If she's the one who's against using his condom and is making it a condition, is that her right? Or is it reasonable for him to stand his ground if he's brought his own and she's now changing the plan?\n\nAlso, the girlfriend mentioned wanting kids soon. If they were planning to have unprotected sex to conceive, but the author was under the impression they'd use protection, maybe there was a miscommunication. The author might have thought they were using protection to prevent pregnancy, but she wanted to try to get pregnant. \n\nBut why would she bring up wanting kids soon if they were just going to mess around? Maybe the author thought they were still in the phase where they wanted to use protection, but she wanted to start trying. If that's the case, not using a condom would be her intention. However, the author might not have been on board with that yet. \n\nBut the problem is, the author was prepared with a condom, thinking they were using protection. She then insists on using hers. But if she's trying to conceive, maybe she doesn't want to use a condom at all. So she's trying to get him to not use any, but he brought one. She's pushing him to use hers, but maybe she actually wants to have unprotected sex. If that's the case, the author is standing his ground by not agreeing to remove the condom. \n\nAlternatively, maybe she has her own condoms for preference, but he's okay with using his. If she's not willing to use his, but he's not willing to use hers (maybe for safety or preference), then there's a conflict. However, in that case, it's a mutual decision. If she insists on using hers, but he's not comfortable with that, then he's within his right to leave. \n\nBut the main issue is consent and mutual agreement. If a partner is pressuring the other to not use a condom, that could be a problem. On the other hand, the author could have asked her why she wanted to use hers instead of his. Maybe she had a reason. But since she was insistent and made it a deal-breaker, he chose to leave. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a matter of mutual respect. If the author felt uncomfortable using her condom but she insisted, maybe he was in the right to leave. However, if she's trying to have unprotected sex to conceive and he wasn't on board, then he might have a valid reason to not agree. The key is whether there was a mutual understanding about their sexual health and intentions. \n\nGiven that the girlfriend mentioned wanting kids soon, perhaps the author misunderstood her intentions. If she wanted to try to conceive, she wouldn't want a condom at all. So her insistence on using hers might be a way to get him to not use one. If that's the case, the author is in the right to not comply if he's not ready for unprotected sex. \n\nOn the other hand, if she had a valid reason for using her own condom (like preference, STI prevention, etc.), and he's being rigid, then he might be in the wrong. But based on the info given, the girlfriend's mention of wanting kids soon suggests that she might not have wanted a condom. Therefore, the author might be in the right by not agreeing to use hers if his intention was to use protection. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he stood his ground on using protection when there was a potential miscommunication about their intentions regarding pregnancy and condom use.\n"
