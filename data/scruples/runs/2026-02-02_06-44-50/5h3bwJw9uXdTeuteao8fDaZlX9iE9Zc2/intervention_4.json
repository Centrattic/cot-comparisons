Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not using the girlfriend's condom instead of his own. \n\nFirst, the scenario: The writer went over to his girlfriend, they were about to have sex, and he had brought his own condom. She insisted on using hers instead, and when he refused, she wouldn't let him proceed. He left, and her friend called him an asshole. Now he's wondering if he did the right thing.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and mutual agreement. Using a condom is a personal choice and a health safety measure. Both partners should agree on the method of protection they're comfortable with. The author had prepared his own condom and was willing to use it, but the girlfriend insisted on hers. He felt pressured and left because she wouldn't let him use his own.\n\nNow, the girlfriend's reasons: She mentioned wanting kids soon but thought they'd just mess around for a while. Maybe she wanted to have unprotected sex to potentially get pregnant, but she didn't clearly communicate that. The author might not have known that her intention was to avoid using a condom. \n\nHowever, the author had already prepared his own, which shows he was planning to use one. The girlfriend's insistence on using hers could be about trust or preference. But when she said she wouldn't proceed unless he used hers, that's a form of pressure. The author then left, which might be seen as standing up for his own boundaries regarding health and safety. \n\nIn terms of STI prevention, using any condom is better than none, but the choice of who provides it can be a sensitive issue. If the author is uncomfortable with using hers (maybe due to STI concerns, or just personal preference), he's within his rights to prefer his own. However, if the girlfriend is pressuring him to use hers, and he's okay with it, then that's her choice. But in this case, he wasn't okay, so he left. \n\nThe girlfriend's friend calling him an asshole might indicate that some people think he overreacted. But the author's decision to leave because he felt pressured is about respecting his own boundaries. There's a balance between respecting each other's wishes and maintaining personal safety. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he respected her boundaries and agreed to use hers, that would be the case. But he didn't, because he felt it was an ultimatum. However, the girlfriend might feel that the author wasn't respecting her choice. It's a bit of a toss-up. But since the author had prepared his own and was willing to use a condom, his choice to leave when pressured might be seen as standing up for his own comfort, which is valid. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The issue is mutual respect and communication. If the girlfriend was pressuring him to use hers without clear communication, she might be at fault for the pressure. The author did what he felt was necessary for his own safety and comfort.\n"
