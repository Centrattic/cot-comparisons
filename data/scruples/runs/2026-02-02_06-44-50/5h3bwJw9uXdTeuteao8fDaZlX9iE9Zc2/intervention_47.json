Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not using his girlfriend's condom. The situation is that the author brought his own condom, but the girlfriend insisted on using hers. She even threatened to end the encounter if he didn't use hers. He left, and now he's being criticized, including by her friend.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is consent and communication. The author had prepared his own condom, which is a responsible action. The girlfriend, on the other hand, wanted to use hers and was firm about it, to the point of making it a deal-breaker. The author felt scared and left. Now he's questioning if he was wrong to not comply.\n\nIn terms of sexual health, using a condom is a mutual decision. Both parties should have a say, but neither should force the other to use a specific method. However, the girlfriend's insistence that he must use hers or else not proceed could be seen as coercive. The author's decision to leave, while it might have been difficult, is about respecting his own boundaries. \n\nBut then, why might the author be in the wrong? If the girlfriend had a valid reason for preferring her own condoms (like STI protection), not using them might be an issue. However, the scenario doesn't mention any such reasons. The girlfriend's primary concern was about wanting to have kids soon, which doesn't necessarily relate to condom use unless there's an unspoken agreement about trying to conceive. \n\nThe author's action of having his own condom ready shows he was considering protection. The girlfriend's insistence might have been controlling or based on her own preferences without full discussion. The author's choice to leave under pressure could be about maintaining his own comfort and safety. However, leaving abruptly might have been a hasty reaction. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's friend calling the author an asshole suggests that her side of the story might have been framed as being in the right, which can happen in such situations. But the author's decision to leave rather than comply with a demand that made him uncomfortable is a valid personal boundary. \n\nSo, considering that both partners should have mutual agreement on contraceptive methods, and neither should be forced to use a specific method without discussion, the author might be in the right for standing his ground. However, if the girlfriend had a legitimate reason (like STI risk) that the author was aware of, then using his own might be necessary. But the scenario doesn't indicate that. Therefore, the author's action could be seen as respecting his own boundaries, and the girlfriend's insistence as overstepping. \n\nBut the user initially thought the author was in the wrong, so maybe there's a different angle. If the girlfriend wanted to use her own condoms for a good reason, then the author's refusal could be problematic. However, the text doesn't clarify that. It's more about her wanting to use hers for reasons not specified beyond not needing his. So, without more info, the author's choice to leave might be justified. \n\nIn summary, the author's decision to not use her condom and leave could be a matter of personal choice and boundaries, but if the girlfriend's refusal to use her own was based on a valid reason (like pregnancy intent), then the author's non-compliance might be an issue. Since the scenario states the girlfriend mentioned not needing a condom for trying to get pregnant, but the author thought she was just \"messing around,\" there's a possible miscommunication. However, the key is that the author had his own, and the girlfriend was insistent. The author's action to leave might be a correct response to her pressure, hence not in the wrong.\n"
