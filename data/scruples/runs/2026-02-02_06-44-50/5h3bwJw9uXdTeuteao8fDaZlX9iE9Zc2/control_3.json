Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who brought his own condom to a sexual encounter with his girlfriend but she refused to use it and insisted on using hers. He ended up leaving because she wouldn't let him use his own, and now he's wondering if he did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions that they were planning to have sex, he brought a condom, but she refused to let him use it. She even said she wouldn't proceed unless he used hers. He left and later received a call from her friend labeling him an asshole. Now he's second-guessing his decision.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is important. Both partners should discuss their preferences and boundaries regarding protection. However, there's a difference between preferring a partner's condom and insisting on using only one's own. The woman's stance here seems pretty firm. If she's refusing to use his condom, even though he had one prepared, that might be an issue. But why would she want to use her own? Maybe it's about control or preferences, but that doesn't necessarily make it right.\n\nLegally and ethically, using a condom is about safety for both parties. If he's uncomfortable with not using his own, maybe there's a reason. However, the situation is complicated by the fact that she mentioned wanting kids soon. If she's planning to conceive, using a condom might not be necessary for that purpose. Wait, the user said she wanted kids soon but thought they'd \"mess around for a week or two and that'd be it.\" So maybe she's not on birth control and wants to get pregnant, hence not using a condom. But the guy might not be ready to have kids, which is why he brought a condom. That's a big conflict in their expectations.\n\nThe guy's choice to leave when she refused to use his condom could be seen as standing up for his own boundaries. If he's not ready to risk pregnancy or STIs, he has a right to insist on protection. However, if she's trying to conceive, using a condom would prevent that. This is a conflict of needs: his need for protection vs. her need to conceive. If they didn't discuss this beforehand, that's a problem on both sides.\n\nBut the woman's refusal to use his condom and her insistence on using hers might be controlling or not respecting his preparedness. On the other hand, if she's genuinely trying to get pregnant and he's not aware of that, he might be misaligned in his expectations. The key here is mutual consent and clear communication. If they didn't talk about their intentions regarding pregnancy and protection, both could be at fault.\n\nThe guy's decision to leave when she wouldn't let him use his own might be his way of not compromising his own safety. However, if he's not ready to take the risk of pregnancy, then using her condom would be necessary for her to get pregnant. But if he's not on board with that, then they need to talk about their goals. The problem is that they didn't have that conversation, leading to the conflict.\n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The woman might be in the wrong if she's pressuring him to use her condom without considering his safety concerns. Conversely, the guy might be in the wrong if he's not considering her desire to conceive. However, since he had a condom ready and she refused, it's possible that she's prioritizing her own goals over his. If he's not ready to take that risk, then he's not in the wrong for standing his ground. But the fact that she mentioned wanting kids earlier might mean he should have had that discussion before the encounter.\n\nIn summary, both parties have responsibilities. The woman might have a right to use her own condom if she's trying to conceive, but the guy has a right to insist on his for protection. The lack of prior communication is a problem. However, since he had a condom and she refused, his choice to leave could be seen as protecting his own boundaries. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (he's not in the wrong), but there's nuance. Alternatively, if he's not considering her wishes (conceiving) and just prioritizing his own (protection), maybe he's in the wrong. But since she was the one refusing his condom, he might not be at fault.\n"
