Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for not using his girlfriend's condom. The scenario is that he brought his own, but she insisted on using hers and said she wouldn't continue unless he used hers. He left, and now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. Both partners should be on the same page regarding contraception and safe sex practices. The author had prepared his own condom, which is a proactive step. However, the girl insisted on using hers. The key point here is whether there was a mutual agreement on which condom to use. The girl's insistence that he must use hers, to the point of threatening to stop the encounter, could be seen as pressuring him. \n\nBut wait, there's also the aspect of her wanting to use her own condom. Maybe she had her reasons, like preferring a specific type or brand, or maybe she wanted to share responsibility. However, she had mentioned wanting kids soon, which might conflict with using a condom. That part is a bit confusing. If she's planning to have kids in two months, using a condom would prevent pregnancy, so maybe there's a contradiction here. Perhaps she wanted to use her condom for other reasons, like STI prevention, but that's speculative.\n\nThe author's decision to leave might be seen as standing up for his own preferences, but leaving abruptly after being pressured could be problematic. However, the girl's friend calling him an asshole suggests there's more to the story, maybe from her side. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. Using a condom is a personal choice and a safety measure. The author had the right to use the one he brought, but if the girl was not willing to proceed unless he used hers, that could be a form of coercion. On the other hand, if the girl was insistent and he walked out, maybe he could have discussed it more calmly. The fact that he was scared might indicate that the situation was uncomfortable for him. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both should communicate clearly. If the girl wanted to use her own, maybe she should have explained why, and the author could have been more open to discussion. Alternatively, if the girl was pressuring him to use hers against his will, that's an issue. The author's choice to leave might have been a way to avoid a conflict, but it's also possible he could have found a compromise, like using both condoms or discussing the reasons behind the preference.\n\nBut since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer depends on the dynamics of their relationship and communication. Since he had prepared his own and she was insistent, maybe he's not in the wrong for sticking with his own. However, walking out could be seen as not being flexible. But given the context of the girl being pushy and the friend's reaction, maybe the author was justified. \n\nIn the end, it's about mutual consent and respecting each other's boundaries. If the girl was pressuring him to use hers and he felt uncomfortable, leaving might have been his way of asserting his own boundaries. So, perhaps he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
