Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author of this story is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is at fault. The situation is about a guy who brought his own condom to have sex with his girlfriend (or a girl he's been talking to for 3-4 weeks, maybe not a long-term girlfriend). When they get to the point of using the condom, the girl insists on using hers instead. The guy was prepared with his own, but she refuses and says he can't have sex unless he uses hers. He feels scared and leaves, and now her friend is mad at him, calling him an asshole. The author is wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Both parties were planning to use a condom, which is good. The guy brought his own, which is responsible. The girl then insists on using hers. The key issue here is consent and mutual agreement on condom use. Condom use is a shared responsibility, and both partners should agree on which one to use. However, forcing the other to use a specific condom or refusing to proceed if they don't comply could be a problem. \n\nIn some cases, if one partner is insistent on using their own condom because they trust it more or have a reason related to their own health, that's understandable. But if the refusal is based on control or manipulation, that's different. Here, the girl mentions she wants kids soon, but maybe that's a red flag if she's pushing for no protection despite her own fertility goals. Wait, but she's insisting on using her condom\u2014maybe that's because she has her own reasons for using one. However, the guy brought his, and she's refusing to let him use his. That could be an issue of control, but maybe she's just being cautious.\n\nThe guy felt scared and left. Is that a valid reaction? If he felt coerced into using her condom, then maybe he's within his rights to not proceed. But if the argument was about mutual trust and both parties should have discussed this beforehand, then maybe the guy should have considered using her condom. However, bringing his own is also responsible. \n\nAnother angle: In many relationships, using a condom is a mutual decision. If one person insists on using their own condom, the other might feel it's a personal choice. But if the refusal to use the other's condom leads to a refusal to engage in the act (as the guy did here), that could be seen as a way out of the situation, but maybe he should have communicated better. Alternatively, if the girl was being controlling by making it a condition, that's a problem.\n\nAlso, considering the part where she mentioned wanting kids soon. If she's planning to conceive, maybe she's in a conflicting situation where she wants to use a condom but also wants to get pregnant, which seems contradictory. That might indicate some inconsistency in her own plans. But the guy might not know her full intentions and is just following through with his own plan.\n\nIn terms of consent and mutual agreement, both should agree on the method of protection. If the girl is insistent on using hers, maybe the guy should have used hers instead of arguing. But he was prepared with his own. Maybe the issue is that he didn't want to use hers for reasons like distrust (maybe he doesn't trust her to have the right type or is concerned about STIs?), but he didn't mention that. The story is from his perspective, so we don't know her side. However, the fact that she's insisting on using hers could be a sign of control or something else.\n\nThe friend calling him an asshole might be because he left her without using her condom. But if the girl was being coercive, then the guy's decision to leave could be justified. However, if the situation was about mutual consent and the guy was just being stubborn, then maybe he's at fault.\n\nIn summary, the key points are mutual consent, control over one's own body, and the responsibility for protection. If both agreed to use a condom, the choice of which one to use should be a mutual decision. If one partner insists on using their own, the other might feel it's a personal choice. However, the guy's refusal to use hers and leaving might be seen as his choice to not proceed if he's uncomfortable. But since he was prepared with his own, maybe he should have used hers if that's what she wanted, unless there's a reason not to. Without knowing her reasons for refusing his, it's hard to say. But from the story, the guy seems to have acted in his own way, and the girl's insistence could be an issue of control.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because he was prepared and tried to use a condom, which is responsible. The girl's insistence on using hers and making it a condition could be her being controlling. However, if the guy left because he felt pressured, that's his right. But maybe he should have used her condom if that's what she wanted. However, without more context on why she wanted her own, it's hard to say. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong for not using hers, I think it's a mutual issue, but since the girl was insistent, maybe the guy is not wrong to leave if he felt uncomfortable. Alternatively, if they had discussed this beforehand, it might be different. The answer might be that he's not in the wrong.\n"
