Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy who brought his own condom to his girlfriend's place, but she insisted on using hers and even threatened not to proceed if he didn't. He ended up refusing and left, and now there's some fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement in sexual activities. Using a condom is a personal choice and a health safety measure. The guy had his own, which is responsible. The girl wanted to use hers, maybe for reasons like her preference, tracking usage, or maybe other reasons. But she didn't force him to use hers, right? Wait, the story says she said she wouldn't let him proceed unless he used hers. That sounds like a form of pressure, even if not physical. He felt scared and left. \n\nNow, the key points: Did he have the right to refuse? Yes, because consent is mutual. She can't force him to use her condom if he's uncomfortable. On the other hand, she's within her rights to set boundaries for herself. But when she said she won't proceed unless he uses hers, that might be a form of coercion. Using someone's refusal as a ultimatum could be manipulative. However, if he's okay with using hers, he could agree. But if he's not, he can't be pressured into it. \n\nThe guy's actions: He had his own, tried to use it, she refused. He then left. Was that wrong? Maybe not. He respected his own boundaries. But the friend calling him an asshole suggests maybe there's a cultural expectation here. But in terms of consent laws, both parties should agree to the terms. He didn't force her to have sex; he left when she was unwilling to use his. So he's not violating any laws. However, if she had a medical reason to prefer hers, that's different. But the story doesn't mention that. \n\nAnother angle: STI risks. If he's using his own, it's his responsibility. If she's using hers, maybe she's concerned about his STI status. But that's speculative. The main issue here is mutual consent. Since he left instead of complying with her demand, he's honoring his own agency. She might have overstepped by making it a deal-breaker. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Probably not. He maintained his boundaries and left when she wouldn't compromise. She should have respected his preparedness. However, communication is key. They should discuss their preferences beforehand. In this case, he might have been wrong to not negotiate, but given her ultimatum, he had a right to leave. So answer B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
