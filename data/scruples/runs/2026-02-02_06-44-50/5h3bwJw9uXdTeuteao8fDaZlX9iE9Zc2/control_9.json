Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not using the girlfriend's condom when she insisted on using hers instead of his own.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the facts. The author had a condom from his own supply, but the girlfriend refused it and demanded to use hers. She even went as far as to say she wouldn't proceed unless he used hers. He refused and left. Now, her friend is calling him an asshole.\n\nSo, what's the main issue here? Condom use is a common point of discussion in relationships, especially regarding consent and safety. The key points are: the girlfriend wanted to use her own condom, the author had his own, there was a refusal to use hers, and the girlfriend insisted. The author then left but is now questioning his decision.\n\nFrom a health and safety perspective, both parties should be comfortable with the method of protection. Using a condom is a mutual decision, and both should agree on which one to use. However, in this case, the girlfriend's insistence might be about more than just the condom. She mentioned wanting kids soon, which could mean she's not on birth control or wants to avoid pregnancy. If the author is not ready for that, then using a condom makes sense. But if he's okay with the risk, maybe he's not. However, the girlfriend's refusal to use his condom could be about control or other personal reasons.\n\nIn terms of consent, if she's not willing to proceed unless he uses hers, and he's not willing to comply, then he's not in the wrong for leaving. Consent is mutual. If one party is pressuring the other, that's a red flag. The author's decision to leave instead of complying under pressure shows he's respecting her boundaries but also his own. However, the girlfriend's friend calling him an asshole suggests she might be defending her friend's stance, possibly seeing it as reasonable.\n\nBut there's another angle: the author had already brought his own condom. The girlfriend's insistence on using hers could be a test or a way to assert control. The author's refusal to comply might stem from a lack of trust or a desire to use his own. However, in a healthy relationship, both partners should be able to compromise. If he's not willing to use hers, maybe he should have discussed the reasons before the situation escalated.\n\nWait, but the girlfriend had already mentioned wanting kids soon. If the author is not on board with that timeline, using a condom is necessary. If he's okay with the risk, maybe not. However, the girlfriend's refusal to use his condom might be because she's concerned about his reliability or if he's using a condom that's not properly stored or expired. Or maybe she has her own brand preference for effectiveness.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for not using her condom if he's comfortable with the risk and she's pressuring him. However, if the issue is about mutual agreement, then both should have a say. Since he left instead of complying, he's not in the wrong. The girlfriend's friend's reaction might be biased, thinking her friend's stance is correct, but the author's decision to leave shows he's respecting his own boundaries.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of mutual consent. If she's not willing to proceed unless he uses hers, and he's not willing to comply, then neither is in the wrong. It's a matter of personal choice and respect. The author's second thoughts might come from feeling like he missed a chance to be flexible, but his initial decision was based on his comfort level.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't in the wrong because he chose not to comply with her insistence and left instead of pressuring her or using her condom against his will. His decision to leave shows he's respecting his own boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
