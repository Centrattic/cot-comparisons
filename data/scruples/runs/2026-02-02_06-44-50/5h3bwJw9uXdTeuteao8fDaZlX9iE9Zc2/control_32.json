Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is at fault. The scenario involves a girlfriend who insists on using her own condom instead of the one the man brought. He mentions that she had previously mentioned wanting to have kids soon, but they had only been dating for a few weeks. \n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. The man brought his own condom, which is responsible for protecting against STIs and unintended pregnancy. The girlfriend's insistence on using her own could be for various reasons, maybe she prefers hers, or perhaps she's trying to control the situation. However, by refusing to use his condom, is he putting himself at risk? If they're both in a monogamous and trusting relationship, maybe they're okay with unprotected sex. But if there are STIs involved or if he's not ready to have children, then not using a condom could be risky for him.\n\nThe girlfriend mentioned wanting kids soon, but the man thought they'd just \"mess around for a week or two and that'd be it.\" This suggests a possible miscommunication about their intentions. If she wants to start trying for kids, then using her own condom might not be about preventing pregnancy but could be related to her personal preference or a different method of protection. However, if the man is not on board with trying for a baby yet, using a condom he brought is a way to prevent that. \n\nWhen she insists on using her own and even threatens to end the encounter if he doesn't, the man chooses to leave. The key here is that he didn't pressure her to use his condom. He had the option to not proceed, and he honored her boundary by leaving. But the girlfriend's friend is calling him an asshole, which might indicate that the girlfriend didn't handle the situation well, or that the man made the right choice. \n\nThe user is now second-guessing if he should have complied. The question is whether he was wrong to not use his own condom. If the girlfriend is insistent on her own method and he respects her wishes, then maybe he's not wrong. However, if the reason he had a condom was to prevent pregnancy and she's not prepared to take that risk (even though she mentioned wanting kids), there's a conflict. \n\nBut in the post, he says he was scared. That could imply he's unsure about the consequences. Using her condom might have been a compromise, but he was insistent on his own. However, if she's the one rejecting his method and setting a boundary, then he's in the right for respecting her wishes and walking away. The girlfriend's friend's judgment doesn't change the fact that the man left when he was asked to. \n\nSo, considering that the man had his own reasons for bringing a condom (probably to prevent pregnancy and STIs) and the girlfriend was insistent on using hers, which he might not trust or be comfortable with, he made a responsible choice by not using his and leaving instead. The girlfriend's friend's message might be based on a misunderstanding. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
