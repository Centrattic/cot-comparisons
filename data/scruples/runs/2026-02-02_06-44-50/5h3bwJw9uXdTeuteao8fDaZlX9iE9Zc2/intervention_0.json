Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about using a condom. The guy brought his own, but the girl refused and insisted on using hers. He didn't use any and left, then got called an asshole by her friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. Both partners should agree on the use of protection. The girl mentioned wanting kids soon, which might mean she's not using other birth control, so using a condom is important. The guy had his own, but she insisted on hers. He went along with her choice but then didn't use any when she wouldn't let him use his. Wait, the guy says he started to unwrap his condom but she refused, then he left. Wait, the timeline is a bit confusing. Let me re-read the post.\n\nHe went over, had a condom in his pocket. They were about to have sex, he pulled out the condom. She said \"no, we're using mine\" and wouldn't let him proceed unless he used hers. He got scared and left. Then her friend called him an asshole. The guy is now wondering if he was wrong.\n\nSo, the key points: The girl wanted to use her own condom. The guy was okay with using his but she refused. She said if he didn't use hers, she wouldn't let him have sex. He left without having sex. His friend called him an asshole.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's think about consent and autonomy. Both partners have the right to set boundaries. The girl has the right to choose which condom to use, but the guy also has the right to bring his own. However, if she's insistent on using her own, and he's willing to go along, that's mutual consent. But if he didn't use any because she wouldn't allow his, that's a problem. Wait, the guy says he was scared and left, so he didn't use any condom. The problem here is that he didn't use protection. If the girl is using her own condom, and he agreed to use it, then he's wrong for not using it. But he claims he didn't use any because she wouldn't let him use his. Wait, the user says he started to unwrap his, she said no, he said he had it, then she insisted on using hers. He got scared and left, so he didn't use any. That's the key. He left without having sex, so he didn't use a condom. However, if the girl was unwilling to proceed without her own condom, and he didn't use any, then he's not using protection. But since he left, no sex occurred, so maybe there's no issue. Wait, but the problem is that he didn't use her condom. Did he refuse to use hers? The user says that when he tried to use his, she refused and said they must use hers. He then got scared and left. So, did he refuse to use hers? Or did he not use any? The user says he was scared and left, implying he didn't use any condom. But if the girl refused to have sex unless he used hers, and he left, then he didn't use any. However, if he was supposed to use her condom but didn't, then he's not using protection. But since he didn't have sex, maybe there's no issue. Alternatively, if he left because he was scared and didn't proceed, then he's not in the wrong for not having sex. But the friend called him an asshole for not using hers. Wait, the user says he didn't use any, so he didn't use hers or his. The friend's friend called him an asshole because he wouldn't use hers. But if the girl was only willing to have sex with her condom, and he left, then he didn't use hers. That's the problem. So maybe he's in the wrong for not using hers when she insisted. But he had his own, which she refused. So perhaps he's not at fault for not using hers because he had his own. Wait, the initial action was that he brought his own, she refused, and he didn't use any. So he's not using any protection. But he left, so no sex happened. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not using hers. But if the girl was not willing to proceed without her condom, and he left, then he didn't use any. But if he had his own and she refused, then he's not at fault for not using hers. However, if he was supposed to use hers because that's her condition, then he's in the wrong for not using it. But he left, so maybe the issue is that he didn't use any. The confusion here is whether he actually used hers or not. The user says he didn't use any because she wouldn't let him use his. So he didn't use her's either. Therefore, he didn't use any. But if the girl wouldn't have sex unless he used hers, and he left, then he didn't use any. The friend is upset because he didn't use hers, but if he didn't have sex, then perhaps it's not his fault. Wait, but maybe he's being called out for not using hers when he could have. Alternatively, maybe he's in the wrong because he didn't use any. But since he left, no sex occurred, so there's no issue. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem is that he didn't use a condom at all. If the girl was using her own, and he left without using any, then he's not using protection. But since he left, no sex happened. The user is confused about whether he should have gone along with using hers. But if the girl was insistent, and he left, then he's not in the wrong for not using hers if he didn't have sex. However, if he had a condom and she refused to use his, but insisted on hers, and he left, then maybe he's not in the wrong. Alternatively, if he had his own and she refused, then he's not at fault for not using hers. Wait, the user is asking if he's in the wrong for not using his own when she said to use hers. The user's friend called him an asshole for making a big deal about it. The user is now wondering if he should have used hers. So, the user's action was that he had his own, she refused, he left. The friend is upset he didn't use hers. The user is now unsure if he was wrong. In terms of responsibility, both partners should agree on the use of protection. If the girl insisted on using hers and the user was willing to use his but she refused, then maybe the user is not in the wrong for not using hers. However, if the user had his own and she refused to use it, then he's not at fault for not using hers. But if he left, then no harm done. Alternatively, maybe the user is in the wrong for not using any condom at all. But he left before having sex, so no harm. The confusion is whether he should have used hers. If he had his own, maybe he should have used his, but she refused. So he's not in the wrong for not using hers. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
