Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a girlfriend who insisted on using her own condom instead of the one the man brought. He was okay with using a condom but wanted to use his own, but she refused and even told him to leave if he didn't use hers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and boundaries. Condom use is a personal health decision, and both partners should have a say in it. The man came prepared with his own, but the woman wanted to use hers. Insisting on using her own isn't inherently wrong, but the key is mutual agreement. However, she went as far as making him leave if he didn't comply, and even her friend called him an asshole for not using hers. \n\nThe woman mentioned wanting kids soon, which adds another layer. If she's on birth control or using emergency contraception, maybe she's more comfortable with her own method. But the man had his own reason for bringing his own, perhaps preferring his brand or method. However, when she made him leave, that's a red flag. Pressuring someone into using a specific condom when they brought their own could be a power imbalance. \n\nAlso, the friend's reaction is problematic. Calling him an asshole over this might indicate that the woman's stance was overly dominant. If the man felt coerced into leaving, that's not healthy. The right to make decisions about one's own body and the methods used for protection should be mutual. \n\nBut wait, the man chose to leave. That shows he respected her boundary enough to walk away, even though he was uncomfortable. However, her insistence to the point of refusal to engage unless her terms were met could be controlling. It's a bit of a gray area. Both have their points, but forcing someone to use a specific condom when they didn't agree might be an overstep. \n\nIn terms of health risks, using a condom from a trusted partner is safe, but the main issue here is consent and mutual agreement. If he was okay with using her condom but she didn't want his, that's one thing, but she made it an ultimatum. The man's choice to leave shows he stood by his own boundary, but the woman's reaction suggests she was overly insistent. \n\nSo, considering all that, the woman's actions might have been inconsiderate and controlling, but the man's refusal to comply could be seen as maintaining his own boundaries. However, since he left without a fight, maybe he's in the right. But if using her condom was her non-negotiable boundary, then he might have been wrong to not comply. But the problem is that she didn't negotiate; she just set an ultimatum. \n\nIn conclusion, it's a complicated situation. The man might not be in the wrong because he stood by his prepared method and left when pressured. The woman's insistence and her friend's reaction are more concerning. So, the answer might be B (No), but I'm a bit conflicted. Let me check again. If the woman had a valid reason for not using his condom, like not trusting it or having specific health reasons, then she's in the right. But if she was just being controlling, then the man is not wrong. Since the man was prepared and she didn't negotiate, but rather made it an ultimatum, he's not in the wrong. So, answer B.\n"
