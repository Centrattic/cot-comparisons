Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is about a guy and his girlfriend (or someone he's dating) who had a disagreement over using a condom. The guy brought his own, but the girl insisted they use hers. He didn't go through with it and left. Now he's wondering if he was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and boundaries. The user says they were going to have sex, and he had a condom. But the girl said they should use hers. Wait, why would she want to use her own? Maybe she has her own reasons\u2014maybe she's more comfortable with hers, or maybe she wants to be in control of the situation. But the key point here is that both parties need to agree on the terms of their sexual activity.\n\nThe user brought his own condom, which is a proactive step. But when the girl said she had some, maybe she wanted to use her own. However, if there's a disagreement over which condom to use, that could be a red flag. But in this case, the girl was insistent to the point of saying he couldn't proceed unless he used hers. Then, when he refused, she called him an asshole through her friend. \n\nNow, consent is about mutual agreement without pressure. If the girl is pressuring him to use her condom and he's uncomfortable, he has the right to say no. But the question is whether he was wrong to not use hers. On the other hand, if the girl is setting a boundary that he's not respecting, then he might be wrong for not complying. But here, the guy had already brought his own, started to use it, and she changed the plan. The issue is whether her insistence was a form of pressure, and whether his refusal was respectful.\n\nAnother angle: the girl mentioned wanting kids soon. If they were planning to conceive, using a condom would prevent that. But the guy might have thought they weren't ready for that yet. However, if she's insistent on using her condom, maybe she wants to avoid pregnancy now, but the guy's initial intention was to use a condom. Wait, there's confusion here. The user says she wants kids soon, but the guy thought they were just messing around for a week or two. Maybe there's a miscommunication about their intentions regarding pregnancy. \n\nBut the main issue is about consent and condom use. The guy had the right to insist on using his own, but if the girl was setting a boundary that he refused to respect, then he might be wrong. However, if she was pressuring him into not using a condom, that's a problem. Wait, in this case, she's pressuring him to use hers. The guy's decision to leave because he didn't want to use hers\u2014was he respecting her boundaries?\n\nThis is tricky. In terms of safe sex, using a condom is important, but the choice of whose to use can be a personal preference. However, if the person is not comfortable with the other's choice, they should communicate. The guy might have felt that using her condom was a risk (maybe he was worried about STIs?), but he didn't mention that. Alternatively, maybe he didn't trust her.\n\nIn terms of consent, if she was refusing to proceed unless he used her condom, and he felt that was a deal-breaker, then walking away was his right. But if she was pressuring him into not using a condom (which she wasn't; she was pressuring him to use hers), then maybe he's in the right. But since he had his own and she wanted to use hers, it's more about whose to use. \n\nThe key point here is that both parties need to have a mutual agreement on the terms of their sexual activity. If he was okay with using hers, then it's fine. If not, then he shouldn't go through with it. But if she was pressuring him to the point of threatening to not let him proceed unless he used hers, that's more of a coercion issue. However, in this case, she didn't say he couldn't have sex with her unless he used hers; she said she wouldn't let him until they used hers. But that's a bit ambiguous. \n\nGiven that he had already brought his own and she changed the plan, maybe he was justified in not wanting to use hers. But if he was concerned about her STI status or something else, that's a different matter. However, the scenario doesn't mention that. So, the main issue is about respecting each other's boundaries. If he walked away because he wasn't comfortable with using her condom, that's his right. However, if she was setting a boundary that he was refusing to respect (like using her condom as a necessity), then he might be wrong. \n\nIn many cases, using a condom is a mutual decision. If one person is not comfortable with the other's choice, they should find a compromise. But if the other person is pressuring, that's not healthy. Here, the girl was pressuring, and he walked away. Depending on the context, maybe he was in the right. But since he had his own, and she wanted to use hers, maybe the issue is about control. If she was trying to control the situation, and he refused, then he's not wrong. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he had the right to use his own condom or walk away if he felt pressured. However, if the girl was setting a boundary he refused to respect, then maybe he's wrong. But in this case, since he had his own and she wanted to use hers, it's more about mutual agreement. If he wasn't comfortable with that, walking away was his choice.\n"
