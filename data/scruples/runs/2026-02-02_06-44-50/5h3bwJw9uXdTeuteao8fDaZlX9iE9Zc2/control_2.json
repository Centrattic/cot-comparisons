Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about using a condom. The guy had his own condom, but the girlfriend insisted on using hers. He didn't want to, so he left. The friend called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend mentioned wanting kids soon, but maybe that's not relevant here. The main issue is about condom use and who's responsible. Using a condom is important for STI prevention. If one partner insists on using their own, there might be a reason. But if the guy has his own, why not use his? Maybe she had a preference or a specific reason for her own, but the guy refused and left. \n\nIs he wrong for not using hers? Well, consent and mutual agreement are crucial. If she refused to proceed unless he used hers, and he didn't want to comply, he had the right to leave. But maybe there's an assumption here that using her condom is safer or part of a mutual agreement. If they're in a trusting relationship, maybe he should have trusted her. But if he's unsure about her reasons, using his own makes sense. However, in some contexts, using the partner's condom could be a way to involve both parties in the decision. \n\nThe friend calling him an asshole complicates things. Maybe the girlfriend had a reason to want her own, like STI status. If he's not sure, using his own is safer. But if she's in a monogamous relationship and both are tested, then maybe it's unnecessary. The guy's actions were to protect himself, but he should have communicated better. Alternatively, leaving might have been a reaction, but he didn't have to use hers if he wasn't comfortable. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It depends on their agreements. If they had an agreement to use condoms, then not using hers could be a breach. But if he had his own, maybe it's a matter of personal choice. However, the girlfriend's insistence might indicate she had a reason. The guy's decision to leave could be seen as standing by his choice. But maybe he should have discussed it more instead of walking out. Overall, he's not necessarily wrong for prioritizing his own boundaries, but the situation is a bit nuanced. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he chose to leave rather than compromise, which is a personal decision, but there are arguments both ways. However, in terms of consent and mutual agreement, if she's not allowing him to use his own, maybe there's an issue. But since he left, he's not wrong for not using hers.\n"
