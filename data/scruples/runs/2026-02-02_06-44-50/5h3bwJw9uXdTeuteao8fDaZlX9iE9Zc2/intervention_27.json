Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a man who brought his own condom, but his girlfriend insisted on using hers. He didn't want to, she refused to proceed otherwise, and he left. Now he's conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement in sexual situations. Both parties should agree on the terms, including contraception methods. The woman wanted to use her own condom, maybe for reasons like pregnancy plans she mentioned. If she's planning to get pregnant soon, using her condom might be a way to control the situation. But why would she refuse his condom? Maybe she wanted to ensure protection in her own way, or perhaps there's another reason. \n\nThe man had already brought his own, but she pushed for hers. He backed out, which shows he respected her boundaries when she said no to his condom. However, she then made it a deal-breaker. The key here is whether using her condom was a necessary condition for her, and if he should have complied. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, if she's insistent and sets a boundary, the man has a choice to either comply or walk away. In this case, he chose to leave, which is his right. But maybe he should have respected her wishes. Wait, but using his own condom is also a form of consent in terms of protection. But she's saying no to his, so using hers is the alternative. If he's not willing to use hers, then not proceeding is the ethical choice. \n\nBut maybe there's a misunderstanding. The woman mentioned wanting kids soon, but maybe she's not ready for conception yet. Using her condom would be a way to prevent pregnancy. The man's condom would also do that. But she's pushing for hers, perhaps to have control. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both should have discussed their preferences beforehand. If she's insistent, he has the right to say he won't compromise. However, if she's made it a non-negotiable condition and he leaves, maybe he's being cautious. But is he wrong for not using his own condom? If she's okay with using hers, and he's okay with that, then it's fine. But he didn't want to use hers, so he left. So he's respecting her boundary by not using his own and not proceeding. Wait, maybe he should have used hers instead. \n\nAlternatively, the problem is that he was prepared with his own, but she wanted hers. If he's not opposed to using her condom, he could have done that. But if he's uncomfortable with that, he can't be forced. So maybe he's not in the wrong for not using his own, but in a way, he could have used hers if he was okay with it. But he wasn't, so he left. \n\nIn terms of consent, both need to agree. She's saying no to his condom, and he won't proceed without a condom. So maybe the issue is that she's not allowing him to use his own, which he's prepared. If he's not willing to use hers, then not proceeding is the right choice. Therefore, he's not in the wrong. But maybe there's more to it. The friend calling him an asshole complicates things. \n\nHmm. The key is mutual agreement. If she's insistent on using her own, and he's not willing to use hers, then he's respecting her boundary by stopping. However, if the condom itself is the method of protection, both are acceptable. If he's okay with using hers, then it's a problem, but if not, then he's within his rights. So the answer might be that he's not in the wrong because he respected her boundary by not proceeding instead of using his own. So the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
