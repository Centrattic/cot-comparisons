Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he went over to his girlfriend, they were going to have sex, and he brought his own condom. She insisted on using hers instead and even threatened to make him leave if he didn't. He ended up not using a condom, left, and now there's some tension with her friend calling him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the basics of consent and safety. Condoms are a form of protection against STIs and pregnancy. If they're not using a condom, there's a risk involved. The girl mentioned wanting to have kids soon, which might mean she's not using other forms of contraception. So, if they have unprotected sex, there's a chance she could get pregnant. But the question is about whether the author was wrong for not using his own condom and insisting on hers.\n\nHe had his own condom prepared, which shows he was responsible. She wanted to use hers, maybe for personal reasons. But why was she so insistent? Maybe she has trust issues, or maybe she's concerned about the STI status of her own condoms? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. If she's bringing her own, she should trust them. But if she's pressuring him to use hers, maybe he's not comfortable with that. \n\nBut here's the thing: in a healthy relationship, both partners should feel safe and respected. If she was pressuring him to use her condom and he felt he had to comply even if he was uncomfortable, that's a problem. But in this case, he had his own, she wanted hers, and he went along. Wait, no, he didn't. He tried to use his, she refused, and he left. So he didn't actually use a condom. Hmm.\n\nWait, the key point is that he didn't use a condom at all. The friend called him an asshole for making a big deal out of nothing. But he was trying to use protection. If she wanted to use hers, maybe she's not ready for unprotected sex. But if she's planning to get pregnant, maybe she's not on birth control and wants to take a chance. However, using a condom is still important for STI prevention. \n\nSo, if she's not using a condom, but he is bringing his own, and she insists on hers, but he's unwilling to use hers, maybe he's being cautious. But why is he wrong? If he's not using a condom, then there's a risk. But the problem here is that he didn't use any condom. The question is whether he was in the wrong for not using his own. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, bringing a condom is a good step. She might have her own reasons for not wanting to use his, maybe she's more comfortable with hers, or there's a personal preference. But if she's pressuring him to use hers, and he's okay with that, he should go along. However, if he has a reason not to trust her condom, that's different. But he doesn't mention that. \n\nSo, the author's mistake might be not respecting her wishes. If she's insistent, then maybe he should have gone along. But he was concerned and left. But if he's the one who started to use a condom, and she refused, then he's not using any. That's a problem for both STI and pregnancy. So, he could be in the wrong for not using a condom at all. However, if he's not comfortable with her condom, maybe he should have discussed it more. \n\nAlternatively, if she's pressuring him to use hers, and he's uncomfortable, then he's in the right for not proceeding. But in this case, he left, which is a good decision. But the friend is calling him an asshole, which suggests that maybe she wanted to have sex without a condom. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. The main issue is whether he's responsible for not using a condom when he had one but she refused. If he's not using a condom, then he's not protecting himself or her. So maybe he's wrong for not using a condom. But he was trying, and she refused. So maybe she's partly to blame. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's the one who had a condom, tried to use it, but she refused, and he left, perhaps he's not in the wrong. However, if he's not using a condom, even if it's her choice, maybe he's still at fault for not using protection. \n\nHmm. It's a bit of a gray area. In terms of responsibility, both partners should agree on the level of protection. If he's not comfortable with her choice to not use a condom, then he should not proceed. But in this case, he left, which is the right decision. So maybe he's not in the wrong. But if she's pressuring him to use hers and he's okay with that, he should go along. However, if he's not sure about her STI status, not using a condom is risky. \n\nBut the post says he had his own. Maybe the issue is that he didn't trust her condom. But there's no indication of that. So maybe he's being overly cautious. But if she's in a position where she's pressuring him, maybe she's not respecting his choice to use a condom. \n\nThis is tricky. The answer depends on whether using her condom is safe. If they both trust each other and she's on birth control, maybe it's okay. But if there's any risk of STIs, then using a condom is necessary. Since the author is the one who brought the condom, it suggests he might be concerned about that. So, he's in the right for wanting to use protection. But she's refusing, leading to no protection. \n\nTherefore, maybe the author is not in the wrong because he was trying to use protection, and she refused. But if he then didn't use any, he's not protecting himself. However, the situation is that he left, so he didn't have sex without a condom. Therefore, he's not in the wrong for leaving. But if he had proceeded without a condom, that would be different. \n\nSo, in summary: He had a condom, she refused, he left. Therefore, he's not in the wrong because he respected her wishes and left instead of proceeding without protection. However, if he's the one who insisted on using his, but she wanted hers, maybe he shouldn't have been so insistent. But the text says she was persistent and made him leave. So maybe she was being unreasonable. \n\nI think the answer is that the author is not in the wrong (B) because he was trying to use protection and left when she refused, rather than proceeding without it. However, it's a close call. But according to the scenario, he left, so he didn't engage in unprotected sex. Therefore, he's not in the wrong.\n"
