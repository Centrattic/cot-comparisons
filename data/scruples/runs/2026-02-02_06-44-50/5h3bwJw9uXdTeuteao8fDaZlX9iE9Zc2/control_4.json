Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend insisting on using her own condom instead of the one the author brought.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement. Using protection is important for both parties. If the girlfriend made it clear she wanted to use her own condom, maybe there's a reason. However, the author had already brought his own, which suggests he expected to use it. The girlfriend's persistence to the point of refusing intimacy if he didn't use hers could be about control or her own preferences, but it's important that both parties agree on the method of protection.\n\nThen there's the mention that she mentioned wanting kids soon. If she's planning to have children, maybe she's on birth control or another method, but that's not clear here. The author might be worried about whether he's respecting her autonomy by not using her condom. However, using a condom is a personal choice, and if she's insistent, it's valid for her to have that preference. On the other hand, if the author felt pressured and left the situation, that could be seen as standing up for himself, but maybe he should have communicated better instead of leaving abruptly.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's friend calling him an asshole complicates things. It might indicate that she's being pushed into a situation she's not comfortable with. The key here is mutual consent and respect for each other's boundaries. If the author was comfortable with using his own condom and she's not, there's a mismatch in expectations. The right approach would be to have an open conversation to understand each other's reasons and find a compromise, like using a combination of methods if possible. Leaving the situation as he did might not be the best approach, but it also shows he didn't want to pressure her beyond her comfort level.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties should have discussed their preferences beforehand. The author could be at fault for not having that conversation in advance, leading to a conflict. However, the girlfriend's insistence on using her own condom without prior discussion might also be an issue. Ultimately, the decision to leave might protect his boundaries, but it's possible he could have handled it differently. The answer hinges on whether prioritizing one's own method of protection without prior discussion is wrong. Since both should have communicated better, but the author's action of not using his own condom was to respect her preference, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if using her condom was a non-negotiable for her without a valid reason, then the author might not be in the wrong for leaving. But if she had a valid reason (like wanting to use a specific brand for comfort or health), then the author should have respected that. The answer is a bit nuanced, but given the information, the author's decision to leave when she was insistent could be seen as taking responsibility for his own boundaries, so he might not be in the wrong.\n"
