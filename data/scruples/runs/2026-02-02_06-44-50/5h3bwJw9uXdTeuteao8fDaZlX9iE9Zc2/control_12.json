Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is about a guy who brought his own condom to a sexual encounter with his girlfriend, but she insisted on using hers instead. He was against it, she refused to proceed unless he used hers, and he left. Now he's asking if he did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The woman had mentioned wanting kids soon, so maybe she's not on birth control and using condoms is important for pregnancy prevention. But he had his own, which is a sign of responsibility. She might have personal reasons for preferring her own condoms, like brand preference, or maybe she wanted to ensure they were her size or something. However, the main issue seems to be about consent and mutual agreement.\n\nWhen it comes to safe sex, both parties should have a say. If she was insistent on using her own, maybe she felt more comfortable with that. But he had already brought his, so maybe he felt that using his was part of his responsibility. However, in a consensual relationship, you have to respect each other's boundaries. If she said she wouldn't proceed unless he used hers, and he was okay with that, then it's a mutual decision. But in this case, he refused and left. \n\nWait, but he left because she wouldn't let him use his own. So, the question is: was he wrong for not using hers? If she was okay with using a condom and insisted on hers, then he should respect that. But if he was okay with using a condom, it's just about whose to use. Maybe it's a personal preference thing. However, using a condom is about preventing STIs as well. If they both trust each other, maybe it's not a big deal, but if there are concerns about STIs, using any condom is better than none. \n\nBut the main point here is about consent and mutual agreement. If she was pressuring him to use hers and he was uncomfortable, then he has the right to leave. However, if they had discussed using condoms and agreed, then using either one should be fine. The fact that she was insistent might indicate she had a reason, but if he felt pressured, then he acting on his own discomfort is understandable. \n\nOn the other hand, if she wanted to use her own, maybe she has a valid reason, like maybe she prefers a different type or has a medical reason. But he had his own, so maybe his reason for bringing his was just preparation. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about mutual consent. If he was okay with using a condom, then using hers shouldn't be an issue. But if he felt that using his was a personal line he couldn't cross, then leaving was his choice. However, in a healthy relationship, both should be able to compromise. \n\nBut the situation says she mentioned wanting kids soon. If she's not on birth control, using a condom is necessary. If he's okay with using a condom, then using hers is just a matter of preference. But he might have reasons for using his own, like he knows the expiration date or the brand. \n\nIn terms of the text, the friend called him an asshole. That might indicate that in the social context, using the girlfriend's condom was expected. But from a personal standpoint, if he was prepared and had his own, maybe he felt it was his responsibility to use them. However, in a relationship, respecting the partner's preferences is also important. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the key issue is about using a condom, and he was okay with using one, then not using hers might not be the problem. The problem might be that he didn't respect her preference. But if he felt that using his own was necessary, then maybe he had a valid reason. \n\nBut in the context of a relationship, especially one where they're considering having kids soon, communication is key. If she wanted to use her own, he should have discussed it instead of refusing. However, if he felt pressured and left, maybe he's not wrong for prioritizing his own comfort. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The main point is that both partners should agree on the method of contraception. If he was okay with using a condom, then using hers should be acceptable. If he was uncomfortable with that, then leaving is his choice. So, maybe he's not in the wrong if he felt that using her condom was a dealbreaker for him, but he could have handled it better by communicating his reasons instead of just leaving. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for not using hers. If he's in a relationship and she's the one who brought up the kids soon, maybe he should have gone along to be considerate. But if he had a valid reason to prefer his own, then maybe not. \n\nI think the answer is B, he's not in the wrong. Because it's about mutual consent and personal preference. If he's okay with using a condom, but not her specific one, then it's his choice to leave if she's insistent. However, in a healthy relationship, they should talk it out. But in this case, he left, which is his right.\n"
