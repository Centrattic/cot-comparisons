Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about using a condom. The guy brought his own, but the girl insisted on using hers and even said she wouldn't proceed unless he used hers. He left because of that. Now, he's getting messages from her friend calling him an asshole. He's wondering if he was wrong to not use her condom.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the basics of safe sex practices. Using a condom is important for preventing STIs and unintended pregnancy. The guy had his own, but the girl wanted hers. The key here is that both parties should agree on which condom to use. There's no rule that says you have to use one person's condom over the other's, but mutual consent is crucial. \n\nThe girl mentioned she wants kids soon, but that's in two months. If they're not planning to conceive now, then using a condom is necessary. The guy might have thought that using his own was sufficient, but the girl's insistence could be about her control over the situation, maybe her own STI concerns, or preference for her own product. \n\nHowever, the red flag here is that she refused to continue unless he used hers. That pressure could be a form of coercion. The guy left, which is a responsible action because he shouldn't be pressured into anything he's uncomfortable with. But the friend calling him an asshole might indicate that the girl's side is being portrayed as the victim. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, using a condom is correct, but who's in the wrong depends on consent and coercion. If the girl was pressuring him to not use his own, that's her being controlling. The guy didn't force her to use his; he offered, but she refused. His decision to leave when she threatened to end the encounter might be the right choice. \n\nBut maybe there's a nuance. If she was insistent for valid reasons, like not trusting his condom or her own health, then maybe he should have considered her concerns. However, it's her body and her health too, so mutual discussion is needed. The guy didn't seem to compromise, but she was firm. \n\nIn terms of ethics, both should agree on the method. The guy didn't act in the wrong by leaving rather than complying with her ultimatum. So maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
