Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person went over to his girlfriend, and they were about to have sex. He brought his own condom, but she insisted on using hers. He tried to use his, but she wouldn't let him and even threatened to make him leave if he didn't use hers. Then her friend called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the basics of consent and sexual health. Condoms are important for both STI prevention and pregnancy prevention. If someone is insistent on using their own condom, maybe they have a reason. But the author had his own and was ready to use it. However, the girl wanted to use hers. Is there a right or wrong here?\n\nIn some contexts, there's a concept called \"condom negotiation,\" where both partners discuss and agree on which condom to use. Sometimes people prefer to use their own for various reasons. However, if one person is insistent and the other refuses, that could lead to conflict. But in this case, the author was willing to use a condom, just not hers. She wouldn't allow him to use his own. \n\nWait, the girl mentioned she wants kids soon. Using her condom might be a way to ensure that her chosen method is used, maybe because it's non-latex or something else. But he might not be comfortable with her condom. However, he was prepared with his own. \n\nBut in terms of right or wrong, if someone refuses to use a condom, that's a problem. But here, the girl isn't refusing to use one; she's just choosing her own. However, the problem is that the author was insistent on using his own. If she's not willing to let him use his own, and he's not willing to use hers, then neither is willing to compromise. But in this case, the girl is the one who said if he doesn't use hers, he should leave. So the author left, which might be seen as standing his ground. \n\nBut maybe the right thing is to respect her preference. If she's insistent, maybe he should comply. But then again, if he's uncomfortable with using her condom, he should express that. However, in this situation, he had his own. The fact that she was insistent and even made him leave might indicate that she was controlling the situation. But if he's not willing to use her condom, perhaps he's being inconsiderate of her choice. \n\nWait, maybe there's a health aspect. If he brings his own condom and she insists on using hers, maybe there's a reason. For example, maybe she has an allergy to latex, so using her own (non-latex) is safer for her. In that case, he should use hers. But he might not have considered that. Alternatively, maybe she's using a specific brand or type, and he's not willing to comply. \n\nBut here, the author is asking if he's in the wrong for not using her condom. The key point is mutual consent and agreement. If both partners agree on which condom to use, that's ideal. If one is insistent and the other refuses, that's a problem. However, in this case, the author was prepared to use a condom but not hers. The girl refused to proceed unless he used hers. \n\nFrom a consent perspective, if one person is not willing to use a condom, that's a deal-breaker. But in this case, the girl is not refusing to use a condom; she's just choosing hers. The author's refusal to use hers might be seen as not respecting her preference, especially if she has valid reasons. However, if he has concerns about her condom, he should address that. \n\nAnother angle: bringing your own condom is a good practice, but if the other person has their own, maybe they prefer to use it. If he's not comfortable with that, he should communicate why. But in this case, he didn't seem to question it, just insisted on using his own. That might be a mistake. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the girl was insistent and he was not willing to use hers, maybe he is. Because she was clear she wanted to use hers, and he didn't compromise. However, if he's uncomfortable using her condom for any reason (like not knowing if it's safe), he should address that. But in this case, he didn't. He just left. \n\nOn the other hand, if using her condom is her choice and she's not forcing him otherwise, but just not allowing him to use his own, maybe he's not in the wrong if he's not willing to proceed without using his own. But if she's the one who made it a deal-breaker, then he's left with no option but to either comply or leave. \n\nIn terms of responsibility for STIs, if he's using his own, that protects him. If she uses hers, maybe it's for her pregnancy plan. But he might not be comfortable with not having control over the condom. \n\nI think the key here is mutual agreement. Since she was insistent and he wasn't willing to comply, maybe the author is in the wrong for not respecting her wishes. However, if the condom choice is a matter of personal preference and he's not willing to compromise, then maybe she's being controlling. But given that he had his own and she wanted hers, the author's refusal to use hers might be the issue. \n\nSo the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't respect her choice and left the situation without compromise. Alternatively, if the girl was being controlling, maybe he's not in the wrong. But generally, respecting a partner's preference in such a situation is important. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not using her condom when she was clear about her preference.\n"
