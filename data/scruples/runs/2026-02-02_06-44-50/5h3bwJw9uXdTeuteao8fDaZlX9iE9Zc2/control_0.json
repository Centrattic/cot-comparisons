Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he went over to his girlfriend after talking for a few weeks, brought his own condom, but she insisted on using hers. He thought she wanted to wait, maybe because she mentioned wanting kids soon, but she actually wanted to use her own. He refused and left, then got criticized by her friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement. Using protection is important for both parties. If she insisted on using her condom, maybe there's a reason, like she wanted to be in control or had specific preferences. But if he was okay with using his own and she was pressuring him to use hers, that could be a power dynamic issue. \n\nCondoms are personal and can be a sensitive topic. Usually, either partner's condom is acceptable, but sometimes people prefer their own for various reasons. However, forcing someone to use a specific condom might not be right if it's non-negotiable and causes conflict. \n\nHe did bring his own, which shows he was prepared and responsible. She might have had a different reason, but his refusal to comply led to leaving. But leaving might have been his right if he felt uncomfortable. However, the friend calling him an asshole suggests there's a social expectation he didn't meet. \n\nAlso, she mentioned wanting kids soon, which could imply she's not on birth control or other methods. If he was worried about her intentions but she was clear, maybe he should have trusted her. On the other hand, if she was insistent without explanation, he had the right to set a boundary. \n\nIn terms of being wrong, the key is mutual consent and communication. If she was using pressure tactics, he might be justified in refusing. However, if there was a misunderstanding about her intentions (like not being ready), then maybe he overreacted. But since he left rather than pushing further, it seems he respected his own boundaries. So maybe he's not in the wrong.\n"
