Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy went over to his girlfriend, and they were going to have sex. He had a condom from his own supply, but she insisted on using hers. She even said she wouldn't proceed unless they used hers. He tried to use his, but she was persistent and eventually made him leave. Now he's wondering if he was wrong to not use her condom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. Both are crucial in any sexual situation. The author had his own condom, but the girl wanted to use hers. He might have thought it was okay to use his own, but she was clear about wanting to use hers. Maybe she had specific reasons, like it was more comfortable, or maybe she had concerns about the ones he brought. However, she also mentioned wanting kids soon, which might be a red flag. If she's trying to get pregnant, she might not want to use any condom, which contradicts her insistence on using hers. That inconsistency is confusing.\n\nThe author's actions: he brought his own, started to use it, but she was against it. He then left when she said he had to use hers. The problem here is that he didn't negotiate properly. Even if someone brings their own condom, the partner should have the final say in how they want to proceed. Consent isn't just about getting your way; it's about mutual agreement. If she was uncomfortable with his condom and he didn't listen, that's a problem. Also, she mentioned wanting kids, so maybe she didn't want protection, but then why use her own condom? That doesn't add up. Maybe she was trying to get him to use a method she preferred, but that's unclear.\n\nAnother angle: using someone else's condom. Is it safe? Condoms are personal items, and some people might be uncomfortable using another's. However, the article says she had her own, so maybe she just wanted to use hers. But if she was insistent and made him leave, maybe she was testing him or had other issues. The author might have been better off asking why she wanted hers and discussing it, instead of just leaving. Leaving might have been his way of asserting control, which isn't good if it's against her wishes.\n\nAlso, the friend calling him an asshole suggests that she's okay with her friend's judgment, which might not be fair, but it's part of the situation. The author's second thoughts mean he's doubting his decision. If he left because she wouldn't let him use his own, maybe he should have respected her preference. But if she was being unreasonable or had hidden motives (like pregnancy), that's another issue. However, the key point is mutual consent. If she was pressuring him to use hers and he didn't want to, but he had already brought his own, he might have been in the right to not comply. Wait, but he didn't listen to her and left instead of negotiating. Maybe he should have had a conversation instead of leaving.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author could have been more communicative. When there's a disagreement about contraception, the correct approach is to discuss the reasons and find a compromise. Since he left, maybe he's avoiding the discussion. On the other hand, if she was being manipulative or had ulterior motives (like getting him to use her condom for a different reason), that's on her. But the author's action of leaving might not be the best, but he also didn't force the issue. The problem is he didn't use her condom, which she insisted on, so in that sense, he didn't follow her wishes. However, bringing his own condom gives him the right to use his if she's okay with it. But she wasn't, so maybe he should have backed down.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be at fault for not respecting her preference and causing conflict. But if she's trying to get pregnant, using a condom at all is conflicting. Maybe she was trying to get him to use her brand, but if she wants to conceive, that's a contradiction. The author might have been right to question her, but leaving without resolving it could be seen as inconsiderate. The answer hinges on whether he respected her boundaries and communicated effectively. Since he didn't agree to her terms and ended the encounter, but she was insistent, it's a bit of a gray area. However, in terms of mutual consent, he should have found a way to discuss it rather than leaving abruptly. So, he might be in the wrong.\n"
