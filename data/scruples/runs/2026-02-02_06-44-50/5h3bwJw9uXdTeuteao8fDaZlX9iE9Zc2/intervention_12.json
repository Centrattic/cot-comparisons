Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author went to his girlfriend after a few weeks of talking. He had a condom from his own supply. When they were about to have sex, he pulled out his condom, but she insisted on using hers. She even said she wouldn't proceed unless they used hers. He felt scared and left. Now, her friend is calling him an asshole. He's wondering if he was wrong to not use her condom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author had his own condom ready, which is responsible. The girlfriend wanted to use hers and was insistent, even to the point of threatening to not let him have sex if he didn't use hers. The author left because he didn't want to comply. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, consent and mutual agreement are crucial in sexual situations. Both parties should feel comfortable and safe. The girlfriend's insistence might be about her own preferences, like wanting to use her own condoms for reasons of control, preference, or maybe even to test the author's compliance. However, she shouldn't have made it a deal-breaker if he wasn't comfortable. The author had the right to use his own condom unless he was okay with hers. If she refused to proceed unless her condom was used, that's a problem because it removes his agency. \n\nAlso, the fact that the girlfriend mentioned wanting kids soon adds another layer. If she's planning to get pregnant, maybe she's not on birth control or wants to time it, but condoms are still used for protection against STIs. The author using his own condom is a safe choice. Her insistence could be about STI protection, but if she's not on birth control, maybe she's using condoms to prevent pregnancy. However, if she's planning to get pregnant soon, maybe she's not using any method, but that's unclear. \n\nThe author's decision to leave might have been his right. If he felt pressured or uncomfortable, leaving was a valid choice. However, there's a part where he says he was scared. That's a red flag. If someone's partner is pressuring them to a point of fear, that's a serious issue. On the other hand, if the pressure was more about preference and not coercion, it might be different. \n\nThe girlfriend's friend calling him an asshole suggests that maybe in their circle, using the partner's condom is expected, or maybe there's some cultural or personal norm at play. But that doesn't necessarily mean the author was wrong. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both should have open communication. The author had the right to use his own condom unless they agreed otherwise. The girlfriend overstepped by making it a non-negotiable condition. The author was within his rights to leave if he wasn't comfortable. However, if he had reasons to doubt her regarding STIs, that's another angle. But the scenario doesn't mention that. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might not be in the wrong. He had his own protection method and chose not to compromise. The girlfriend's behavior was controlling, which is problematic. Therefore, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong). However, there's a nuance here. If the girlfriend was pressuring him to use her condom for legitimate reasons (like her own STI protection), then maybe he should have considered that. But since he had his own, he's in a better position. The key is mutual consent and communication. The girlfriend shouldn't have made it a deal-breaker. The author's right to use his own condom is valid, so he's not in the wrong.\n"
