Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement over which condom to use between him and his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, context is important. The user went over to his girlfriend's place with his own condom. She insists on using hers and even says she won't proceed unless he uses hers. He was planning to use his own but she refused. He left because she wouldn't let him use his, and her friend called him an asshole for not complying.\n\nNow, the key points here are consent, respect, and communication. The girlfriend's insistence on using her condom might be about her personal preference or maybe something related to her health or plans, like wanting to get pregnant. The user mentions that she had mentioned wanting kids soon, which might be a red flag if he's not ready or if they didn't discuss birth control properly. But the immediate issue here is who is at fault in the condom choice.\n\nUsing a condom is a mutual decision. If someone is pressuring the other person not to use their own, that could be a problem. However, in this case, the woman is setting boundaries by saying she won't proceed unless he uses hers. That's her right. But the user brought his own, which is good. The conflict arises when she insists on hers. Is there a reason why using her condom is a problem?\n\nIf the user is uncomfortable with that, maybe because of STI concerns or other reasons, he has the right to express that. But in this scenario, he just left. The question is whether he's wrong for not using her condom. If they had discussed it beforehand, maybe there's more to it. But here, she's setting a condition, and he walked out. \n\nFrom a consent perspective, both parties should agree on the terms of the encounter. If she said no to his condom, and he left, that's his choice. But if she was pressuring him not to use his own, maybe she's overreaching. However, if she's okay with using a condom and just prefers hers, he should respect that. Alternatively, if she wants to get pregnant, using a condom at all might be contradictory, which could indicate a deeper issue. But the user didn't clarify that he wanted to avoid pregnancy, which might be a missing piece.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, bringing your own condom is a good practice. If she insists on hers, maybe there's a health reason. But if he's unsure about her condom's safety or trust issues, he should address that. However, the scenario doesn't mention any health concerns. He just left because she wouldn't let him use his own, which might be his way of asserting his preference. However, respecting her choice is also important. \n\nSo, the user's action was to leave when she wouldn't let him use his condom. The question is whether that makes him wrong. If he had a reason to not trust her condoms, maybe he was right. But if there's no such reason, not using hers could be a refusal to meet her halfway, especially if she's the one setting the boundary. But he brought his own, which was a good gesture. Maybe the problem is that they didn't communicate about this beforehand. \n\nIn conclusion, if the user had a valid reason to prefer his own condom (like STI prevention and not discussing it), he might have a point. But if it's just about personal preference and she's setting a boundary, then he might be in the wrong for not respecting her choice. However, the situation is nuanced. The answer might depend on whether there were underlying issues not mentioned, like differing health statuses or prior agreements. Since the scenario doesn't provide that info, the user's action of leaving could be seen as not respecting her boundaries, making him wrong. Alternatively, if he felt coerced, but the problem is he didn't negotiate better. Hmm. I think the key is that using a condom is a mutual decision, and if she's insistent, he should either comply or walk away. In this case, he walked away, which is his right, but maybe he should have discussed it more instead of just leaving. However, the fact that she called him an asshole for not using hers might indicate she was being unreasonable, but that's her friend. The answer could be that the user is not in the wrong because he respected his own boundaries by not using hers if he was uncomfortable, but if the issue was about her preference and he had no valid reason to refuse, then he's in the wrong. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards the user being in the wrong for not using her condom unless there's a specific reason.\n"
