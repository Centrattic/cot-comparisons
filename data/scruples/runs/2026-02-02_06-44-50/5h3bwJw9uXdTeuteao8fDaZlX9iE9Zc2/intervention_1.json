Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a guy who brought his own condom to a sexual encounter. The girlfriend said they should use hers instead, and when he insisted on using his, she refused to proceed and even had a friend call him an asshole. The user is asking if the author (the guy) is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement. Using a condom is a personal choice and a health precaution. The guy brought his own, which shows he's responsible. The girlfriend wanted to use hers, maybe because she has her own supply or preferences. But he's okay with that, right? The problem arises when she becomes persistent and insists on using hers, even to the point of refusing to continue if he doesn't. That's a form of pressure. \n\nWait, but the guy is also being firm about using his own. Is there a point where insisting on using your own condom is okay? Like, if someone has their own and is comfortable with it, they might prefer to use theirs. But when the other person is adamant about not using it, that's a conflict. However, in this case, the girlfriend is not just being adamant; she's making it a deal-breaker. She won't let him proceed unless he uses hers. Also, the friend calling him an asshole adds another layer of social pressure. \n\nBut the key here is mutual consent. Both should agree on the terms. If the girl is okay with using his condom, he should be able to. But she's refusing, maybe because she has her own reasons. The guy might be thinking about STI protection or just personal preference. However, the girlfriend's reaction is extreme. She's making it a non-negotiable, which could be considered manipulative or controlling. \n\nWait, but the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. Maybe the user thinks the guy should have respected his girlfriend's preference. But in reality, the girlfriend is not just suggesting; she's refusing to proceed if he doesn't comply. That's more about her having control rather than mutual agreement. So the guy might be in the right for standing his ground, especially if he brought his own and wanted to use it. However, if the girlfriend is against using that, maybe there's a communication issue. But the fact that she's forcing him to use hers instead of allowing his own could be a problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the guy is being too stubborn. If the girlfriend has her own condoms and wants to use them for a reason, like she's already prepared or has specific reasons (maybe she's more comfortable with hers, or there's a medical reason), then he should respect that. But in this case, she's making it a deal-breaker. So it's a conflict between two people's preferences. The guy's action of leaving might be reasonable if he's not willing to comply, but the girlfriend's reaction is harsh. \n\nAnother angle: using a condom is a personal choice. If he brings his own, he should be allowed to use it. If she's okay with that, they can use her condom. But she's not okay with his. That's a problem. Maybe she doesn't trust his condom, but that's not stated. The guy's decision to leave might be the right choice, especially if she's pressuring him to use hers. But the friend's involvement complicates things. \n\nSo, who is at fault here? If the girlfriend is pressuring him to use her condom when he's comfortable with his own, that's a form of manipulation. The guy is in the right for not giving in to that pressure. However, if the situation escalates to the point where she's making it a deal-breaker, maybe both are at fault for not communicating better. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer would depend on whether using his own condom is reasonable. If the girlfriend is uncomfortable with that, maybe he should have respected her, but in this case, she's not uncomfortable with using a condom in general, just not his. That's a red flag. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong for standing by his own choice, especially if he's prepared and the girlfriend is being unreasonable. The girlfriend's behavior is more concerning here. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
