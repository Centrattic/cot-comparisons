Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a man who brought a condom, but his girlfriend wanted to use hers instead. He refused to use hers and ended up leaving. Now her friend is upset, and he's questioning if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and safety. Using a condom is a personal choice for protection. If the woman insisted on using her own, maybe there's a reason she prefers that. But the man had already brought his own. However, the key point here is that she said she wouldn't proceed unless he used hers. That could be a form of pressure or even coercion if he didn't feel comfortable with that.\n\nWait, but the woman mentioned wanting to have kids soon. If they're planning to conceive, using a condom would prevent pregnancy. That's a bit conflicting. If she wants to get pregnant, why use a condom at all? Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. The man might be confused about her intentions.\n\nThe man's decision to leave because he wasn't comfortable using her condom\u2014was that wrong? If the woman is pressuring him to use a specific condom, maybe she has her reasons, but the man has the right to his own boundaries. However, if the situation escalated to her saying she won't proceed unless he uses hers, that could be a form of manipulation or control. \n\nBut in terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The man chose not to comply with her request, leading to the breakup. The woman's friend is upset, but maybe the man was within his rights to prioritize his own comfort. However, if the woman is genuinely trying to conceive, using a condom would contradict that. Maybe the woman was lying about her intentions, or there's another factor.\n\nIn terms of sexual health, using any condom is better than none. But if the man had his own, why was he forced to use hers? Maybe she wanted to control the situation, or perhaps there's something else. The man's choice to leave could be seen as standing up for himself, but if the woman was pressuring him, maybe he should have communicated better instead of walking out.\n\nI think the main issue here is mutual respect and communication. The woman's refusal to accept his condom and the ultimatum might have been too much pressure. The man had the right to his own preferences, but so does she. The real problem is the lack of mutual agreement. If they couldn't find a compromise, then maybe the situation was going to end regardless.\n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong, maybe both parties have some responsibility. But since the question is about the author, who is the man, he might not be in the wrong for choosing not to use her condom if he felt it was necessary for his own reasons. However, walking away might have been an overreaction. But given the options, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he respected his own boundaries.\n"
