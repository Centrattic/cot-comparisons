Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a condom disagreement between them and their girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the man went over prepared with his own condom. When they started to have sex, he pulled it out, but the woman insisted they use hers instead. She even said she wouldn't proceed unless they used hers, and later, her friend called him an asshole. The man then left the situation and is now questioning his decision.\n\nNow, considering consent and safety. Using a condom is a mutual decision. If one partner insists on using a specific condom, perhaps there's a reason. Maybe the woman is concerned about the man's health, or she has specific preferences. But here, the problem is that the man was prepared with his own, and she wanted to use hers. However, the key point is whether using his own condom would have been harmful. \n\nIf the woman is trying to conceive, maybe she's using a non-lubricated or specific type of condom that doesn't interfere with fertility, but the man brought a regular Trojan. Alternatively, maybe she wanted to use a different method, like a diaphragm or something else. But the man's action was to use his own, which she opposed. \n\nIn terms of consent, both parties should agree on the method of protection. If she's insistent that they use hers, there could be valid reasons. However, if she's pressuring him to not use his own, that's a boundary he's refusing. But if he's comfortable with his own and she's not allowing his choice, that's a conflict. \n\nWait, but he was using protection, just not hers. The issue might be about control or safety. Maybe she doesn't trust his condom, or she wants to have control over the situation. But he's prepared, so why not let him use his? Unless there's another reason. \n\nThe man's decision to leave could be seen as standing his ground. But if the woman is pressuring him, that's her issue. However, the fact that he was prepared with his own and she wanted to use hers might not be a big deal if both are safe. But the problem is that she refused to proceed unless he used hers, which could be a form of pressure. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, maybe the man isn't in the wrong because he had his own and was willing to use it. But he was in a situation where she wouldn't allow it. Alternatively, if the woman is pressuring, maybe she's in the wrong for not allowing his choice. However, the man could have compromised by using hers if that's what she wanted. \n\nBut the key here is that the man used his own condom, which the woman didn't want. She might have a reason, but he was the one who brought it up. If he had his own, maybe he should have used it unless she had a valid reason. But she didn't let him, so he backed out. \n\nHmm. This is tricky. From a consent perspective, both should agree. If he's insisting on using his own and she's refusing, maybe the problem is his insistence. But if she's pressuring, maybe she's in the wrong. However, the man left, which shows he respected her boundaries. Wait, no\u2014he didn't leave because of her, he left because she wouldn't let him use his own. So he's the one who left, but she made that happen. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, using a condom is a shared responsibility. If the woman is against using a condom because she wants to conceive, then the man's use of a condom would be counterproductive. But the man was using a condom, which would prevent pregnancy. So maybe the woman's insistence is because she wants to try to get pregnant, and the man's use of a condom would prevent that. But if he's not on birth control, maybe they need to discuss their plans. \n\nThe man mentions she said she wants kids soon, but he thought they'd mess around for a while. So there's a discrepancy in their plans. Using a condom would prevent pregnancy, which might be why she's against it. If that's the case, then the man's action of using a condom would be against her wishes. But if she's pressuring him to not use one, that's a conflict. \n\nIn this case, the man is using a condom, which is a form of protection. If the woman is against it because she wants to conceive, then the man's action is conflicting with her plans. However, he's the one who brought the condom, and she's the one who refused. So maybe the man is in the wrong for not respecting her desire to try to conceive. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the woman is in the wrong for pressuring him. But if they had discussed their plans beforehand, the man should have known her intentions. The man didn't anticipate that she wanted to try to get pregnant, so he was prepared with a condom. But if she wanted to conceive, using a condom is against that goal. \n\nSo, in this scenario, the man's action of using a condom without considering her desire to conceive might be the issue. Therefore, he's in the wrong because he didn't respect her wishes regarding trying to get pregnant. However, if they hadn't discussed this, maybe it's not his fault. But the woman had mentioned wanting kids soon, so the man should have considered that. Using a condom would prevent pregnancy, which she wanted to avoid. \n\nTherefore, the man is in the wrong because he didn't take into account her expressed desire to conceive, leading to a conflict. The answer would be A.\n"
