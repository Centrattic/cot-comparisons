Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy who had a condom but his girlfriend insisted he use hers instead. He refused and left. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. Condom use is a matter of consent and mutual agreement. The key points here are: the woman said \"no no, there\u2019s no need, I have some,\" but the guy had his own. She then became persistent, saying they must use hers, and even threatened to make him leave if he didn't comply. \n\nThe guy's reasoning was that he came prepared, and he was hesitant because she mentioned wanting kids soon. Maybe he was worried about her using a condom she had for another purpose or maybe he didn't trust her? But he ended up not using any, left, and her friend called him an asshole.\n\nNow, in terms of right or wrong. In sexual situations, both parties should agree on the terms. Condoms are for protection, so if one person insists on using their own, the other should respect that. However, if someone is insistent and even makes it a deal-breaker, that's their choice. The guy had the right to refuse her specific request (using her condom) and leave if he felt uncomfortable. But by not using any condom, he might have ignored her preference. Wait, she said she had some, so maybe she was okay with using a condom but wanted to use hers. But he had his own, so why was she so adamant? Maybe she had her own reasons for not using his. Or maybe she wanted to use her own for some reason, like she had specific ones or maybe even a different method.\n\nBut the main issue here is consent regarding the condom. If the woman is insistent that her partner uses her condom, and he refuses, is that a problem? The guy's refusal could be seen as not respecting her boundaries. However, if he felt pressured or uncomfortable with her choice, maybe he had legitimate concerns. But using a condom is a standard practice for safety. If he's okay with using a condom but just doesn't want to use hers, that's a problem. Because if he's set on using a condom, using hers should be acceptable. Alternatively, if he's not comfortable with her condom for some reason (like he doesn't trust her or her supply), he could have discussed it instead of just leaving.\n\nThe guy's response was to leave, which is his choice, but not using a condom at all (as per his account) could be seen as not respecting her wishes. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, which would mean the author (the guy) is wrong for not using her condom. But the guy didn't actually use any, so if the woman wanted to use a condom (hers), and he refused both his and hers, then he's being non-compliant. However, the story says he had his own, which he was about to use, but she insisted on hers. If he had agreed to use hers, that would have been respecting her. Instead, he left, but the act didn't happen. The problem is, he was prepared to use a condom but refused to use hers. If she was insistent, maybe she had a reason to prefer hers (like trust, type, etc.), but he was prepared to use a condom, so not using any at all could be a mistake. \n\nBut the guy's reasoning was that he was scared because she mentioned wanting kids soon. Maybe he thought using a condom would prevent that, but she wanted to use one for protection. That's a conflict. If she wanted to use a condom for STI protection and he wanted to have unprotected sex, then he's not respecting her boundaries. However, if she was okay with not using a condom and just wanted to use hers (maybe for her own reasons, like she had a specific brand), but the guy brought his own, then the conflict is about which condom to use, not whether to use one. \n\nThe key here is whether using her condom was a deal-breaker. If she was insistent that her condom must be used, and he refused, then he's not respecting her consent. But he had his own, so if the issue was just about using hers versus his, then maybe the problem is more about preference than consent. However, in the story, the woman says \"if I wasn't to use hers, I might as well leave,\" which implies that using her condom was a non-negotiable. If he felt that was a deal-breaker, he had the right to leave, but he also had the option to respect her request. \n\nIn terms of who's wrong, if using a condom is a mutual agreement, then using a specific one shouldn't be the issue. However, if the woman was insistent on her own for her reasons (maybe she had a specific type, or it's for her own use), then the guy's refusal could be seen as not respecting her. But he was prepared to use a condom, so the issue was the choice of condom. If the woman is okay with using a condom but wants hers, then using her condom is part of her consent. Therefore, the guy's refusal to use her condom could be seen as not respecting her consent to her own choice. Therefore, the guy is in the wrong for not using her condom when she insisted, leading to the situation where no condom was used. But in the story, he didn't use any, so he either used his and left, or left without using any. The exact outcome isn't clear, but the act didn't happen. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author (guy) had a condom, was about to use it, but the woman insisted on hers. He refused and left. The user says he's in the wrong. If the woman's insistence was a form of consent to use a condom, then by not using any (even his), he's not respecting her consent. However, if the woman was okay with using a condom but wanted hers, then using her condom is part of the agreement. If he refuses to use any, he's not respecting her consent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the woman was okay with unprotected sex but wanted to use her own condom. That's confusing. The guy had a condom, she said no, she has some. Then he says he has one and starts using it, but she insists on hers. Maybe she didn't want to use a condom at all but was lying. Or she wanted to use hers for another reason. \n\nIf the woman wanted to use a condom, the guy's refusal to use hers (despite having his own) could be seen as not respecting her. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. So the answer would be A.\n"
