Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy who brought his own condom, but his girlfriend insisted on using hers. He refused and left, and now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the basics of consent and sexual health. Both partners should have a say in what happens during sexual activity. Condoms are a form of protection, and both partners have the right to decide which one is used. But there's also the aspect of mutual agreement. \n\nThe girl mentioned wanting kids soon, but that might not be directly relevant here. The main issue is about using her own condom. She refused to proceed unless he used hers, which led him to refuse and leave. He says he was scared and didn't want to use hers. \n\nWait, why would he be scared? Maybe he's concerned about the condom's quality or other reasons? The user didn't specify, but maybe it's a trust issue. However, if she's insistent and he's uncomfortable, that's a problem. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, using a condom is a shared responsibility. If one partner insists on a specific method and the other refuses, leading to the situation not happening, is that the wrong move? The guy chose to leave, which might be his right if he's not comfortable. But maybe he should have communicated better. \n\nAlso, the girl's friend called him an asshole, which could be a red flag about her friend group. But the main question is about the guy's actions. Did he have the right to not use her condom? If he's concerned about the condom's safety or if there's a medical reason, that's different. But the story doesn't mention that. \n\nIn most cases, both partners should agree on the use of protection. If she's insistent and he's uncomfortable, maybe the right approach is to find a compromise, like using his condom instead. But if she refuses, then he can't force her either. However, in this case, he left, which could be seen as taking a stand for his own boundaries. \n\nBut does that make him wrong? If he's not willing to use her condom and she's not willing to use his, then maybe neither is in the wrong. However, if he's the one who brought up using a condom in the first place, and she's just suggesting using hers instead, maybe there's an issue here. \n\nWait, the guy brought his own, started to use it, and she refused. He had the right to bring his own, but she's asserting her preference. If it's a mutual decision, he should respect her choice. But if she's making it a non-negotiable demand, that's where the problem lies. \n\nSo, if he's comfortable using hers, then he should. If not, he has the right to refuse. However, by not using any condom, he's putting both of them at risk. But in this case, he didn't proceed, so there's no risk. \n\nThe key points are consent and communication. The guy left because she wouldn't let him use his. If he's uncomfortable, he has the right to leave. But if he's in a relationship where she's making it a big deal, maybe there's an issue with her approach. \n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The guy might be in the wrong if he's not respecting her preference, but he's also in the right if he's asserting his own boundaries. However, using protection is important, and if both can't agree, maybe neither is at fault. But the friend calling him an asshole adds another layer. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), meaning the author is not in the wrong because he stood up for his boundaries and left when she became too insistent. But others might argue he should have compromised. However, given the information, the guy's actions seem justified if he's not comfortable using her condom and she's being unreasonable.\n"
