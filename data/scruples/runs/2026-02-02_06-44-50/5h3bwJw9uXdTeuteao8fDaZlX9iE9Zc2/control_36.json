Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about using a condom. The guy brought his own, but the girlfriend insists on using hers. He refuses and leaves, and now she's getting friends involved, calling him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend mentioned she wants kids soon, so maybe she's not on birth control, which would make using a condom important. But if she's offering her own condoms, why was she so insistent that he not use his? Maybe she has a reason to prefer hers. But the guy was prepared with his own, so why the pushback?\n\nIn terms of consent and mutual agreement, both partners should agree on the method of protection. If she's refusing to use his condom and insisting on hers, it's part of her boundaries. The guy had the right to set his own boundaries too. By refusing to use her condom and leaving, he's asserting his boundary. However, if she's clear that she wants to use her own, maybe he should respect that unless there's a reason not to trust her. \n\nBut wait, if she's using her own condom, it's her choice. The guy might have concerns about the condom's safety or if he's worried about STIs. But the story doesn't mention that. The girlfriend is the one who wants kids soon, which might imply she's using other methods, but if she's not, then using a condom is necessary. \n\nThe key here is mutual consent and respecting each other's boundaries. The guy brought a condom, which is responsible. The girlfriend is setting a boundary that they use hers. By refusing, he's not following her boundary, which could be a problem. However, if he has a reason to prefer his own, like trust issues or concerns about the other's safety, then his choice is valid. But the story doesn't say he had any such reasons. \n\nAlso, she called him an asshole through her friend, which is bad behavior. But that doesn't necessarily mean he's right. It's possible that both parties have some fault. The guy could have negotiated more instead of just leaving. Alternatively, if her demand was non-negotiable and she was pressuring him, maybe he was right to leave. \n\nIn terms of the user's question, the main issue is whether he was in the wrong for not using her condom. If she's the one setting the boundary, and he's refusing to meet her terms, then he's in the wrong. But if he has valid reasons, like STI concerns, then maybe not. Since the story doesn't mention STIs, it's possible that the main issue is his refusal to respect her preference, especially if she was clear. However, bringing his own condom shows he was prepared, which is good. The girlfriend's insistence might stem from her own preferences or past experiences. \n\nSo, if the guy was okay with using his own and she insisted on hers, but he left instead of trying to find a compromise, maybe he's in the wrong. But if she's being manipulative or pressuring him without good reason, then she's at fault. The text says she wouldn't let him proceed unless he used hers, which could be a form of coercion if it's non-negotiable. However, if it's a mutual decision, then he should go along. \n\nThe answer is a bit of a toss-up, but given that he left and she's upset, maybe the guy was wrong for not respecting her boundary. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, he could have validly chosen to leave if he felt pressured. The user is asking if he's in the wrong, so the answer might be A (yes) or B (no). Considering the information given, since he had his own condom and she wanted hers, but he refused and left, maybe he's not in the wrong because he's respecting his own boundaries. However, if her boundary is that they use hers, then he should respect that. I think the correct answer is A (yes, he's in the wrong) because he didn't respect her boundary. But I'm a bit confused. Maybe the answer is B (no) because he had his own and she was being unreasonable. Hmm.\n"
