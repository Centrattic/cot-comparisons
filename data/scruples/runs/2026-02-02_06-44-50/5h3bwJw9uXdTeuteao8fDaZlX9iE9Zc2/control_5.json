Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who had a condom with him but his girlfriend wanted to use hers instead. He refused and left, and now her friend is calling him an asshole. The question is whether he's wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to think about consent and boundaries. Both parties should have the right to set their own boundaries regarding safe sex. The girl wanted to use her own condom, maybe for her own reasons, like trust in her own supply, STI testing, or just personal preference. But the guy had already brought his own, and he was okay with using it. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, using a condom is a mutual decision. If one person is uncomfortable with the other's method, there's a problem. The girl might have felt that using her own condom was safer for her, maybe she's tested for STIs and he hasn't, or vice versa. But the guy was prepared with his own, so he might not have had a reason to be against using his. \n\nHowever, forcing someone to use a specific condom could be an issue. If she's refusing his condom without a valid reason, maybe that's where the problem lies. But the guy chose to leave rather than compromise. \n\nIn some contexts, if someone refuses to use a condom that the other person has provided, it could be seen as being controlling or not respecting the other's choice. However, if he's refusing to use her condom because he doesn't trust her supply, that's a different matter. The story says he had his own and was ready to use it, so possibly he just didn't want to use hers for some reason. \n\nThe key here is mutual agreement. If both are comfortable and have agreed on using a condom, the choice of whose to use might not matter as much. But if one person is insisting on using their own for valid reasons, that's their right. However, if there's a refusal without a valid reason and causing conflict, that's where things get tricky.\n\nIn this case, the guy left because she wouldn't let him use his own. He might be in the wrong because he was prepared to use a condom, and she was also offering hers. By not compromising, he might have been avoiding a discussion about her reasons. Alternatively, if he's not willing to use her condom, maybe he's not respecting her boundaries. But if he had no issues with using his own and she was pressuring him to use hers against his will, then he's not wrong to leave.\n\nThe friend calling him an asshole suggests that maybe she thought he was being difficult. But maybe the girl's insistence on using hers was about her own comfort or health. The guy might have been in the right by not compromising on his own choice of protection. However, if they were both okay with using a condom, the choice of whose to use might be a minor issue. \n\nSo balancing both sides: the guy is not using his own condom, which he brought, and she's insisting on hers. He leaves because she's being persistent. If he's comfortable with using his own, and she's not allowing that, maybe she's overstepping. But if the issue is about trust or STI risks, then using her condom might be important for him. The story doesn't mention STIs, so maybe trust isn't a factor. \n\nIn conclusion, if both are using a condom, the choice of whose to use isn't the main point. The main thing is that they both agree to use one. If she's refusing his condom without a reason, maybe she's being controlling. The guy left, which could be a way to avoid discomfort. In that case, he's not wrong because he's standing by his own preparedness. But if she had valid reasons for using hers, maybe he should have been more accommodating. Since the story doesn't state her reasons, it's hard to say. However, the fact that she mentioned wanting kids soon might mean she's not on birth control, so using a condom is necessary. If both are okay with it, the choice of whose to use isn't as important. Therefore, the guy is not in the wrong for using his own.\n"
