Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who brought his own condom, but his girlfriend insisted they use hers instead. He refused and left, and now her friend is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement. Both partners should agree on whether to use protection. The girl wanted to use her own, but the guy had his own. He didn't want to risk using hers, maybe because of reliability or other concerns. However, by insisting on his own, he might have ignored her preference. \n\nBut then, she said she wouldn't proceed unless they used hers. That's a power play, which is problematic because consent shouldn't be conditional on using a specific product. If she's pressuring him to use her condom and threatening to stop otherwise, that's a red flag. Similarly, if he's refusing to compromise and leaving, that's his choice, but using a condom is mutual responsibility. \n\nAlso, the fact that she mentioned wanting kids soon complicates things. If they're planning for pregnancy, maybe she was okay with not using any, but he might be concerned about STIs. However, if they both agree on no protection, that's their choice. But if there's a mismatch in STI status, using a condom is important. \n\nThe key here is mutual consent and compromise. If she's pressuring him to use her condom and he's not willing, but she's not willing to use his, then he's not wrong to leave. Because sexual activity shouldn't be forced in any way. However, if they both wanted to use a condom but just had a preference on whose to use, that's a different scenario. But since she's saying she won't proceed unless they use hers, and he's not comfortable with that, walking away is his right. \n\nSo, the guy isn't in the wrong for leaving. He's standing up for his own boundaries regarding the type of protection. She shouldn't be pressuring him on that. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
