Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. Let me break down the scenario step by step.\n\nSo, the author went to his girlfriend's place, and they were about to have sex. He brought his own condom, intending to use it. When he tried to put it on, she said no and insisted on using hers. He thought she wanted to have kids soon, so maybe using her condom would help with that. But he was hesitant because he wasn't sure why she was so insistent. She then said she wouldn't proceed unless he used hers, and when he refused, he left. Her friend texted him calling him an asshole for making a big deal out of nothing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The main issue is consent and the right to make decisions about sexual health. Using a condom is a mutual decision, and both partners should feel comfortable and safe. If one partner insists on using their condom instead of the other's, there could be various reasons. In this case, the girl mentioned wanting kids soon, so maybe she wanted to control the timing. However, if she had a specific reason for preferring her own condom, like it being more effective or a personal preference, that's her choice. But if she was trying to manipulate the situation to get pregnant without his consent, that's a problem.\n\nThe author's decision to leave might be seen as standing up for his own preferences. However, if she had already mentioned wanting kids and he's aware of that, maybe he should have considered her wishes. But consent is crucial. If she was pressuring him to use her condom without his agreement, especially if he had reservations, he is within his rights to refuse. \n\nOn the other hand, if she had a legitimate reason (like she's on birth control and it's okay, or if using her condom is part of her plan to conceive), then his refusal might be against her wishes. But the key here is mutual consent. If she was making it a deal-breaker, that's her decision, but he's not obligated to comply if he doesn't feel comfortable.\n\nAlso, the fact that her friend called him an asshole might indicate that the girl's friends don't support her stance, which could imply that her reasoning wasn't sound. The author's main point is that he felt uncomfortable with using her condom, and he chose to leave rather than comply. In terms of rights, both partners should have a say in the method of contraception. Forcing one partner to use a specific type without mutual agreement is a violation of consent.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because he respected his own boundaries. However, he might need to communicate better with his girlfriend to understand each other's needs. But in the context of who is at fault here, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
