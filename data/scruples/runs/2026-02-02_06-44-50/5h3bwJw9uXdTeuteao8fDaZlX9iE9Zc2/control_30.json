Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not using his girlfriend's condom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author went to his girlfriend's place, and they were about to have sex. He brought his own condom, but she insisted on using hers. He tried to use his, but she refused and said she wouldn't proceed unless he used hers. He left, and her friend is upset with him.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and control over the situation. Condoms are a form of protection, and the person using them should have control over which one is used. The girlfriend mentioned wanting to have kids soon, but he didn't take that as a sign to not use a condom. Wait, if she wants kids, maybe she doesn't want protection? But that's not necessarily the case. Maybe she's on birth control and still wants to use a condom for disease prevention. Or maybe she wanted him to use her specific brand for some reason.\n\nThe author had his own condom ready, which he considered using. But the girlfriend insisted on hers, to the point of threatening to not let him proceed. That seems like she's in control of the situation. But if she's the one who's supposed to be in control of her own body and her health, then maybe she has a right to specify which condom is used. However, the author is also responsible for his own safety. If he's uncomfortable with using her condom, he has the right to not proceed.\n\nWait, but he did bring his own. So maybe the issue is that she's refusing the one he brought and insisting on hers. But he's not in the wrong for not using hers if he doesn't trust her or if there's any reason to believe the condom might not be safe. However, the scenario doesn't mention any reason he wouldn't trust her condoms. She's his girlfriend, so maybe he trusts her. But he also has the right to use his own.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend is pressuring him to use her condom, which he's not comfortable with. If he had already made up his mind he wanted to use his own, and she's refusing, then he's not wrong to walk away. But if there's a mutual agreement beforehand about which condom to use, then maybe he should have discussed it more. But in the heat of the moment, maybe it's okay for him to stick with his own.\n\nAlso, she mentioned wanting kids soon. If he's using a condom, that's preventing pregnancy. But if she wants kids, maybe she's not on birth control and he's using a condom to prevent pregnancy. But then she wants to get pregnant, so she doesn't want him to use hers. So maybe she's trying to get pregnant, and he's the one who wants protection. Wait, that's confusing. If she wants kids soon, maybe she doesn't want to use a condom. But he's bringing his own. So perhaps the argument is about whether to use a condom at all. If she wants kids, then using a condom would prevent that. So maybe the author is using a condom to prevent pregnancy, but she wants to get pregnant, so she refuses the condom. In that case, the author might be in the wrong if he's not considering her desire to have children. But he might be using the condom for STI protection. If they're in a monogamous relationship and both are in a monogamous relationship, maybe the STI risk is low, but it's still his choice.\n\nBut the question is about not using his own condom. So he had his own, but she refused to let him use it. He left. Is he wrong for not using hers? If he didn't want to use hers, then he's not wrong for walking away. But maybe he should have used hers if that's her preference. However, if there's no trust in the condom's safety, but the scenario doesn't indicate that. It's possible that she's just more comfortable with her own, but he's not obligated to use it if he's uncomfortable. So in terms of consent, both parties should agree on the method of protection. If they can't agree, then it's okay to not proceed. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because he's making a decision based on his own comfort with the condom. However, if she's his girlfriend and she's already mentioned wanting kids, maybe he should have considered that she doesn't want to use a condom. But he might have thought she was talking about wanting to conceive in the future, not necessarily right now. There's a bit of ambiguity here.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both people should be on the same page about protection. If he's not willing to use her condom, and she's not willing to use his, then neither should proceed. The author made a choice to walk away, which is his right. The girlfriend's friend calling him an asshole might be the issue, but the author's actions were based on his own comfort. So in this case, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's choosing his own method of protection, and if she's not okay with that, it's her choice to stop the encounter. However, if they're in a monogamous relationship and she's willing to take the risk, maybe he should have used hers. But the text doesn't clarify that. Given the information, the author isn't wrong for leaving when she wouldn't let him use his own.\n"
