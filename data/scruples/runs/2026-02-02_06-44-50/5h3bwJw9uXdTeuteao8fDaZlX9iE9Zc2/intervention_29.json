Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is wrong. Let me read through the situation again to understand both sides.\n\nThe situation is that the man went over to his girlfriend's place, brought his own condom, but she insisted on using hers. He thought she wanted to use protection, but she actually wanted to get pregnant soon. He refused to use hers, she made him leave, and now he's questioning if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and safety. Using a condom is a personal choice and a safety measure. The man brought his own, showing he was responsible. The woman insisted on hers, possibly because she wanted to avoid pregnancy. But he might not have been ready for that step yet. \n\nWait, the woman mentioned wanting kids soon, but the man didn't think much of it. So maybe there's a communication breakdown. The man's right to refuse a condom is his own, right? But is it wrong to not use a condom if the other person is on birth control? Or is the issue about her insisting on using her own? \n\nThe key point is that both parties should agree on the use of protection. If the woman wanted to use her own, and he didn't agree, then he's within his rights to say no. However, if she wanted to avoid pregnancy, maybe she should have used another method if he refused. \n\nBut in the scenario, the man didn't want to use her condom, and she made him leave. The friend calling him an asshole adds to the conflict. The man's choice to leave might be because he wasn't comfortable using her condom. But is that wrong? \n\nCondoms are a personal choice. If he wanted to use protection, using his own is acceptable. The woman's insistence might have been about control or her own plans for pregnancy. However, if she was okay with not using a condom, but he wasn't, he has the right to refuse. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong: the man isn't in the wrong if he chose to use his own condom and she refused. But since he didn't use any because of her insistence, maybe he's wrong in not protecting himself. Wait, he had his own, but she wouldn't let him use it. So he left. \n\nIf he was okay with using her condom, but she wouldn't let him use his, but he's not okay with using hers, then he's not at fault. However, if he's in a relationship where she wants to have sex without protection, but he doesn't, then there's a disagreement. But in this case, she wanted to avoid pregnancy, so maybe she had a method already. But he's the one who brought a condom, so he might have thought protection was necessary. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. The main issue is mutual consent and communication. If the woman was okay with not using a condom because she uses another form of birth control, then the man's refusal to use hers might be about his comfort. But if he's not comfortable, he's right to refuse. However, if she's insistent on using her own, he has the right to say no. \n\nIn the end, the man left, which shows he wasn't comfortable. The friend's reaction might be biased. The answer depends on whether using her condom was necessary. If the woman was on birth control or using another method, then the man's refusal isn't wrong. But if the woman didn't have another method and the man refused to use any, then he's wrong. However, the scenario says she wanted kids soon, which implies she might not be using birth control. So if the man didn't want to use a condom, he's not using protection, which could lead to pregnancy. But she was okay with that. \n\nWait, the man thought she wanted to use protection, but she actually wanted to get pregnant. So there was a miscommunication. The man's responsibility is to use protection if he's not ready for pregnancy. Therefore, he's in the right to use his own condom. However, she made him leave because he wouldn't use hers. So he's not in the wrong for leaving. The answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to be careful. If he had the choice to use his own, but she wouldn't let him, and he left, then he's protecting himself. So answer B.\n"
