Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe author went to his girlfriend's place, and they were planning to have sex. He brought his own condom, but she refused to use it and insisted on using hers. He thought she might want to get pregnant soon, but he wasn't ready. She got so insistent that she made him leave, and her friend texted him calling him an asshole. Now he's wondering if he made a mistake by not using her condom.\n\nFirst, I should consider consent and mutual agreement. Condom use is a personal choice and a safety measure. The author brought his own, which shows he's responsible. But the girl wanted to use hers. However, there's a nuance here. If she's insistent on not using his and insists on using hers, does that mean she's pressuring him to take a risk he's not comfortable with? Also, he mentioned she mentioned wanting kids soon, but maybe she wasn't ready yet. Wait, he thought she wanted kids in two months but thought they might just mess around for a couple of weeks. But maybe she actually wanted to wait until she's ready to conceive. \n\nBut the key point here is about consent. If she's not willing to use his condom and insists on hers, but he's not comfortable with her condom for some reason, is that a problem? However, the author didn't refuse the sex itself but was asked to use her condom. If he was okay with using her condom but she made him not use his, but he's not in the wrong for not trusting her condoms? Wait, the story says he was using his own but she refused. He had his own, but she wanted to use hers. He then left. \n\nWait, but condoms are individual use. If she had her own, he could use hers. But maybe he was concerned about the sterility or the condom being expired or not his. But he didn't mention any issues with her condoms. However, he didn't trust hers, or she didn't want him using his own. But he was prepared with his own. \n\nAnother angle: If someone is pressuring you to not use a condom you brought, and you leave because you're uncomfortable, is that inconsiderate? The girl might feel pressured if he insists on using his own. But the author was using his own, but she wanted to use hers. He thought she wanted to get pregnant soon, but maybe she actually wanted to prevent pregnancy. There's a contradiction here. He thought she wanted kids soon, but she was pressuring him to use a condom? That doesn't make sense. Wait, if she wants kids, why would she want to use a condom? Unless she's not ready yet. Maybe there's a misunderstanding. The author thought she wanted to get pregnant soon, but maybe she actually wants to avoid pregnancy now. \n\nSo the author is confused. He brought a condom, expecting to use it, but she wanted to use hers. Then he leaves. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not using her condom. If she's pressuring him to use her condom, but he's not comfortable with that, then leaving might be his right. However, if the situation was consensual, and he's the one who was prepared with a condom but she didn't want to use it, maybe he's being overly cautious. But if she's not on birth control and wants to avoid pregnancy, he's right to use a condom. \n\nWait, but he said she mentioned wanting kids soon. If she wants to get pregnant, using a condom would prevent that. So maybe the author misunderstood her. If she wants to get pregnant, she wouldn't want to use a condom. But in this case, she is insistent on using her own. So perhaps she actually doesn't want to get pregnant yet, which contradicts her earlier statement. The author is confused because he thought she wanted kids soon, but she's using a condom. That's a key point. Maybe she's lying about her intentions. \n\nSo the author, not wanting to get her pregnant, is using a condom, but she wants to use hers. Wait, but if she wants to get pregnant, she wouldn't use a condom. So maybe she's not being honest. The author is right to be cautious. Therefore, leaving might be the right choice. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's trying to use a condom and she's pressuring him not to, and he leaves, he's not in the wrong. But if she's pressuring him to not use a condom, and he leaves, that's his choice. However, if she's pressuring him to use her condom, maybe she's being controlling. \n\nAlternatively, if the author was okay with using her condom but she made him leave, maybe he's inconsiderate. But the story says he was using his own, and she insisted on using hers. He didn't want to use hers, so he left. So he's not using a condom at all? Wait, no, he was going to use his own but she wanted to use hers. He didn't use a condom in the end because she wouldn't let him use his. So he left. \n\nWait, the situation is that he had a condom, and she refused to use it, insisting on hers. So he didn't use a condom and left. But then the friend called him an asshole. Is he in the wrong for not using her condom? If he was prepared with his own, but she refused, and he left, then he's not in the wrong for prioritizing his own safety. However, if the issue is about consent and mutual agreement, then both parties need to agree on the method of protection. If she's pressuring him to not use his own and use hers, and he's not comfortable, leaving is a valid choice. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He was trying to use a condom, she was insistent on hers, and he left. He's responsible for his own safety, so not using her condom is his right. The friend calling him an asshole is wrong because he was trying to be safe.\n"
