Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a guy who brought his own condom to a sexual encounter, but his girlfriend insisted on using hers instead. He tried to use his, but she refused, even to the point of threatening to end the encounter unless he used hers. He left, and now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. Condom use is a personal choice, and both partners should agree on it. The guy came prepared, which is responsible. The girlfriend wanted to use her own, which might be about her comfort, maybe she prefers a certain brand or has her own reasons. But when she insisted so much that he left, maybe she was being controlling or not respecting his preparedness.\n\nThen there's the part where she mentioned wanting kids soon. If she's planning to get pregnant, maybe she's not on birth control, so using a condom is important to prevent pregnancy unless they're both okay with it. But the guy might not be ready for kids yet, so using his own condom makes sense. However, the girlfriend's insistence might be about her own pregnancy plans, so there's a conflict here.\n\nThe guy's actions: he brought his own, which is good, but when she refused, he left. Was that the right move? Leaving might be his way of asserting his choice, but it could also be seen as not compromising. The friend calling him an asshole suggests that maybe she's in a bad light here, but that's just from the friend's perspective.\n\nThe key points are mutual consent, respect for each other's choices, and communication. If the girlfriend was pressuring him to use her condom without discussing the reasons, maybe she's not respecting his decision. On the other hand, if he's okay with using hers, then it's a mutual agreement. But he felt scared, which might indicate some pressure or discomfort on his part.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, if both parties can't agree, neither is entirely wrong. But using a condom is a shared decision. The guy's choice to leave might be his way of standing by his decision, but maybe he should have communicated better. However, the girlfriend's refusal and ultimatum could be seen as overstepping, especially if she's pressuring him against his preference. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. It's a bit of a grey area, but since he was prepared and she was insistent without compromise, he might be justified in leaving. The friend's reaction might be a red herring, but the main issue is mutual consent and respecting each other's preferences. If she was insistent without considering his preparedness, he's not wrong to stand his ground.\n"
