I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a straight male who had a sexual arrangement with his gay friend, then things changed when he got a girlfriend, and later when he broke up, they resumed. Now the friend is upset after the author ended the oral sex and tried to reciprocate but felt bad and stopped. The friends are now distant.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: he engaged in a sexual relationship with a friend, which was clear from the start. He then ended it, which could be seen as breaking a mutual agreement. The friend is now upset, leading to the question of who is at fault.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The author says it was clear he's straight and not interested in a romantic relationship. However, the friend might have felt the relationship was more than just a sexual one, leading to emotional investment. When the author ended the oral sex and tried to reciprocate but then stopped, it might have left the friend feeling rejected or confused.\n\nAlso, the author's decision to stop after reciprocal action could have been abrupt. Even if he felt uncomfortable, handling it in a way that's considerate of the friend's feelings might have been better. The friend's reaction of becoming distant suggests he felt hurt or disrespected, even if the author didn't intend to lead him on.\n\nThe author's friends in the sub said it's his fault for leading on, which the author denies. But by participating in the sexual arrangement without establishing clear boundaries, he might have created a situation where the friend felt the relationship had certain expectations. Ending it suddenly without addressing the emotional aspects could contribute to the friend's hurt feelings.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author had a responsibility to maintain clear communication. Even if his intentions were not romantic, the friend's emotional response is valid. The author might be in the wrong for not anticipating the emotional impact of ending the sexual relationship and not managing the transition properly. So, considering all factors, the answer leans towards the author being at fault.\n"
