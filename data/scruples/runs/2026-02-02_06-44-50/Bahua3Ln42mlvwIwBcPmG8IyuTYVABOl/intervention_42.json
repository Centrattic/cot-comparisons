I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, who identifies as straight but heteroflexible, had a friend who is gay. The friend offered a blowjob, and the author accepted. They continued this for a while, then the author got a girlfriend and stopped. When the relationship ended, they resumed, but then the author felt guilty and told the friend to stop. Now the friend is distant, and the author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is in a friendship with a gay friend. They engaged in a sexual activity that's one-sided\u2014receiving oral sex from the friend but not reciprocating except once. When the author started feeling bad about the dynamic, they stopped and told the friend. The friend then became cold and distant. The author is confused because they thought they were clear about their orientation and didn't want a romantic relationship.\n\nThe author's actions might be seen as using the friend for sexual favors without reciprocation. Even if the author didn't intend to lead them on, the friend might have felt used. The fact that the author stopped after one time of reciprocating but by then the damage might have been done. The friend's reaction suggests they felt hurt or disrespected. The author's initial acceptance of the sexual favors could have been a power imbalance, making the friend feel like their affection wasn't valued beyond the author's physical needs. Also, when the author started reciprocating, they felt sick and ended things, which might have further hurt the friend's feelings.\n\nThe community's reaction said the author led them on, which the author denies. But maybe the issue isn't about leading on romantically but about not considering the friend's feelings and needs. The author might not have realized that the friend's actions were expressions of affection and desire for a closer relationship, which the author then rejected. Even if the author is straight, the friend might have felt that their gestures were not appreciated or were taken advantage of.\n\nAnother angle: mutual consent was there initially, but the ongoing nature of it might have created an expectation that the author didn't fulfill. The friend might have wanted more from the relationship, and the author's refusal to engage beyond receiving could have been hurtful. The author's girlfriend breaking up and then resuming the activity might also complicate things, as the friend could have felt like the author was being disloyal or inconsistent.\n\nIn summary, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the emotional impact on their friend, didn't maintain a balanced relationship, and ended things abruptly after one-sided reciprocation. The friend's distance is a reaction to feeling used or unappreciated. So the answer is likely A.\n"
