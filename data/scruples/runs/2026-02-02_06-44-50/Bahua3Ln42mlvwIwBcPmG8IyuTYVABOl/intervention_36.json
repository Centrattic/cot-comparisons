I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a straight, heteroflexible man who had a sexual arrangement with his gay friend, then called it off after getting a girlfriend and later dumping her. Now the friend is distant, and the user is questioning his actions.\n\nFirst, the initial part where he accepted the blowjobs while single seems okay, but the key points are the ongoing arrangement and the context. When he got a girlfriend, they stopped, which is responsible. However, after the breakup, they resumed the sexual activity. Then, when he decided to reciprocate, he felt bad and ended it. The friend became upset, leading to a rift.\n\nThe user's friends say he led the friend on. The main issue here is consent and communication. The user claims he was clear about his orientation and that there was no emotional commitment. However, engaging in sexual acts can imply certain expectations, even if unspoken. The friend might have hoped for a deeper connection or reciprocity beyond just physical acts. When the user decided to stop, it could have felt abrupt, especially since the friend was already emotionally invested. \n\nAlso, the fact that the user reciprocated once and then stopped might have confused the friend, leading to hurt feelings. The user might not have considered the emotional impact on his friend, even if the friend is gay. The friend might have seen the act of returning the favor as a step toward mutual interest, which wasn't there. \n\nEven though the user was upfront about his sexuality, the actions might have created mixed signals. The friend's reaction of becoming cold suggests that the user's behavior affected their friendship negatively. The user's attempt to communicate the end of the arrangement was polite, but perhaps not empathetic enough to the friend's feelings. \n\nIn summary, while the user might not have intended to lead the friend on, the situation is complicated by the nature of their interactions. The user's actions, even if consensual, could have caused emotional harm, making him at least partially at fault for not considering the friend's feelings more thoroughly. So, Answer A.\n"
