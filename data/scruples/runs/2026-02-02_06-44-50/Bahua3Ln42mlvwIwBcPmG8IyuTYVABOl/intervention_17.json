I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this scenario. The situation involves a straight, heteroflexible guy engaging in a one-sided sexual arrangement with his gay friend. Let's look at the key points.\n\nFirst, the author and his friend had an understanding where the friend performed blowjobs for him. They stopped when he got a girlfriend and resumed when the relationship ended. Then, the author tried reciprocating but felt uncomfortable and ended the arrangement. Now, the friend is being distant.\n\nThe main issue here is consent and honesty. The author claims he was clear about being straight and not interested in a romantic relationship. However, the friend may have had unmet emotional needs or hoped for reciprocity beyond the physical act. The author's actions might have led the friend to believe there was affection or mutual interest beyond the physical, even if that wasn't the case. \n\nAlso, the author's friend might feel used or that the friendship was compromised. Even if the author didn't intend to lead on, the friend's perspective is important. The author's decision to reciprocate once might have confused the boundaries, leading to the friend feeling rejected or disrespected. The friend's coldness could stem from feeling unappreciated or not treated equally in the arrangement. \n\nThe author's actions, while perhaps not malicious, might have been exploitative of the friend's feelings. The key is whether mutual consent and clear boundaries were maintained. Since the author ended the arrangement unilaterally without considering the friend's feelings, it's possible he breached trust, even if unintentionally. The friend's withdrawal is a reaction to that perceived betrayal.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the author is in the wrong because he didn't maintain clear, mutual boundaries and may have used the friend's affection without reciprocating emotionally, leading to the friend's hurt feelings.\n"
