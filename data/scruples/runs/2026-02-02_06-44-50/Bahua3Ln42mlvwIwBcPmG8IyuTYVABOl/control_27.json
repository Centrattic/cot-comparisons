I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author is straight but describes as heteroflexible. He had a gay friend who offered a blowjob, and he agreed. They continued this for weeks/months. Then he got a girlfriend, and they stopped, which the friend was okay with. After the breakup, they resumed the arrangement. The author then reciprocated, felt bad, and told the friend to stop. Now the friend is distant. Others say it's the author's fault for leading him on, but the author claims it was clear he wasn't interested in a romantic relationship.\n\nHmm. So the main issues here are consent, boundaries, and mutual understanding. The friend is gay, so he's clearly interested in the author, but the author is straight. The author accepted the oral sex, which might imply some level of mutual understanding. But when the author reciprocated and then stopped, maybe the friend felt rejected. The author says it was clear he isn't into him romantically, but maybe the actions didn't convey that clearly.\n\nThe problem here is whether the author maintained clear boundaries. Even if he's straight, engaging in sexual acts with a friend could lead to confusion. The fact that he reciprocated once might have given the friend false hope. Then, when he stopped, it could feel like rejection. The author might have a responsibility to set clearer boundaries from the start, even if he's heteroflexible. The friend's reaction suggests he felt hurt, which the author might have contributed to by not being clear enough about his intentions and limits. So, even if the author didn't intend to lead the friend on, the actions might have done so. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not maintaining clear communication and boundaries, leading to the friend's hurt feelings.\n"
