I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me go through the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author, a straight heteroflexible guy, had a gay friend who offered a blowjob. He accepted and they did it a few times. Then he got a girlfriend, and they stopped. When the girlfriend dumped him, they resumed. Later, the author felt bad and reciprocated, but felt awful and ended it. Now the friend is cold and distant, leading the author to question his actions.\n\nSo, the main points here: The friend is gay, which might mean he's looking for emotional connection, maybe even a relationship. The author, being straight, might not have been able to provide that. The arrangement started as one-sided, with the friend doing oral for the author, which could be seen as the friend investing emotionally while the author just took pleasure. When the author reciprocated, maybe the friend felt rejected or even more confused. The author tried to explain it's not him, but the friend is now distant.\n\nThe key issue here is consent and mutual understanding. Did both parties agree on the terms? The author says it was clear he wasn't interested in a romantic relationship. But even so, the friend might have developed feelings or felt used. The author's actions could be considered emotionally manipulative, using the friend for sexual favors without reciprocating in a meaningful way. Ending it after reciprocation might have hurt the friend's feelings, making him feel devalued.\n\nAlso, considering their age (18), they might still be figuring out social dynamics. The author's actions might have crossed a line in terms of friendship, even if they didn't enter with bad intentions. The fact that they were close friends might have made the situation more complex. The author could have been leading the friend on without realizing it, even if he didn't intend to. The friend's reaction suggests he felt betrayed or hurt, which points to the author being in the wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong for using the friend in a way that didn't consider his emotional needs and possibly led to a breach of trust in their friendship.\n"
