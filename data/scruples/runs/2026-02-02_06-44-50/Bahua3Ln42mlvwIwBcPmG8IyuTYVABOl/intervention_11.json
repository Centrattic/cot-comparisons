I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author is a straight male who had a gay friend. They started an arrangement where the friend offered blowjobs, which the author accepted. They did this for a while, then stopped when the author had a girlfriend. After the girlfriend dumped him, they resumed the activity. Later, the author felt bad and reciprocated, but then decided to stop again, explaining it wasn't his thing. Now, the friend is distant and unresponsive, leading to the author feeling conflicted.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. Initially, both parties were okay with the arrangement. The author didn't lead the friend on in terms of emotional commitment, as he clarified he's straight and not interested in a romantic relationship. When he ended the physical interactions again, he did it politely. The friend's reaction is now affecting their friendship.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics, the author made a choice to stop something the friend was doing for him. Even though there was no emotional deception, the act of stopping after repeated interactions might have left the friend feeling rejected or unappreciated. The friend's coldness could stem from feeling used or not valued beyond the physical interactions. However, the author did communicate his boundaries clearly. The problem here is that while the author is honest about his preferences, the friend might have developed emotional attachment or expectations that weren't met. The author didn't force anything, but the abrupt ending after resuming could have hurt the friend's feelings.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's tricky. The author wasn't deceptive but might not have considered the emotional impact of ending the interactions. The friend's behavior is also a factor\u2014being distant might be a reaction to feeling unvalued. However, the author did make an effort to communicate, so it's not entirely his fault. Still, maintaining a friendship after such a dynamic might require more empathy from both sides. Since the author is honest and clear about his boundaries, maybe he's not entirely in the wrong. But the friend's reaction suggests there was an unmet expectation. The main issue is whether the author understood the friend's perspective. So, while he's not entirely wrong, there might be some responsibility in how he handled the ending of the arrangement. But according to the question's options, it's a yes/no for being in the wrong. Given that the author acted within his boundaries and communicated, maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong. But others might argue A because of the impact on the friend. Hmm, the consensus in the sub said A, but the user is unsure. The key is whether leading on was intentional. The author said it was clear he's straight, so maybe he's not in the wrong. So, B.\n"
