I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a straight guy who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then things changed when he got a girlfriend and later broke up. Now the friend is upset and distant, and the author is confused about whether he's the bad guy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is described as heteroflexible, which he clarifies to mean straight but open to some same-sex interactions. His friend is gay and offered a blowjob. The author accepted this, which might not be inherently wrong, but there's a dynamic of mutual consent here. Then, when he got a girlfriend, they stopped. After the breakup, they resumed, but then the author felt bad and reciprocated, which made him uncomfortable. He then ended things, and the friend became distant.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author led the friend on. The author claims they were clear about his sexuality and that there was no expectation of a romantic relationship. The friend, being gay, might have had different expectations. The author's actions could have been seen as exploiting the friend's feelings or not being honest about his own limits. Even though the author tried to be upfront, the act of engaging in a sexual favor with a friend could have emotional implications, especially if one party is in a committed relationship at times. \n\nWhen the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, but after the breakup, resumed the arrangement. Then, when the author reciprocated, he felt uncomfortable and ended things. The friend's reaction is understandable if he felt used or if he developed feelings that the author wasn't aware of. The author might not have intended to lead the friend on, but the ongoing back-and-forth could have created mixed signals. The fact that the friend was cold after the author stopped reciprocating suggests that the author's actions hurt the friend's feelings. \n\nSo, even if the author thought he was being clear, the friend might have interpreted the actions differently. The author's heteroflexibility and the friend's homosexuality are part of the dynamic, but the key is mutual understanding and consent. If the friend felt that the author was using him for sex without considering his emotional needs, then the author might be at fault. Also, the author changed his stance when he reciprocated and then stopped, which might have left the friend in a worse position emotionally. \n\nConsidering all this, the author might have been careless with the friend's feelings, even if unintentionally. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
