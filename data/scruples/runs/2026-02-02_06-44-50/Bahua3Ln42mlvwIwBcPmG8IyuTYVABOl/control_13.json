I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for a situation involving a gay friend and some sexual activities. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is a straight, heteroflexible male. His gay friend offered a blowjob, and he agreed. They had this arrangement for a while. Then he got a girlfriend, and they stopped. After the breakup, they resumed the oral sex. Later, the author felt bad and reciprocated but then stopped it, explaining it wasn't who he is. The friend became distant, and the author is confused because they were close before.\n\nNow, the key issues here. The author's actions involved a friend who is gay. The friend offered oral sex, and the author accepted. Then, after resuming after a breakup, when the author tried reciprocating and then stopped, the friend got upset. The author is wondering if he's at fault.\n\nFrom a relationship and consent perspective, the author and friend had a mutual arrangement. However, the author's decision to reciprocate and then stop might have caused confusion or hurt. The friend's reaction could stem from feeling used or rejected. The author might have given mixed signals, even if he intended to be clear about his sexuality. The fact that they were friends and then had this sexual dynamic could complicate things. Also, when the author's girlfriend left, resuming the arrangement might have made the friend feel like a substitute, leading to hurt feelings when it was stopped again.\n\nThe author's initial acceptance of the friend's advances might not be the issue, but the ongoing dynamic and the way he handled ending it could be problematic. The friend might have felt that the author was only interested in the physical aspect and not in building a reciprocal emotional connection. The author's attempt to reciprocate and then quickly stopping could have left the friend feeling confused or undervalued.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, while the author tried to communicate his boundaries, the situation might have been exploitative. The friend's feelings of being led on could be valid, even if the author didn't intend to. The key here is whether the author respected the friend's needs and whether the dynamics were consensual and clear. However, since both agreed to the arrangement initially, it's a complex situation. The author might be in the wrong because the friendship was affected, and his actions may have caused emotional harm despite his intentions. The friend's reaction suggests that the boundaries weren't as clear as the author thought, leading to hurt feelings. So, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
