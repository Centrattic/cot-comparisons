I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The scenario involves a straight guy having a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then things falling apart after he ends it.\n\nFirst, the author is heterosexual and heteroflexible. He had a one-sided sexual relationship with his friend, where the friend performed oral sex for several months. Then, after the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, but when the relationship ended, they resumed. The author then decided to reciprocate, which made him uncomfortable, so he stopped and ended the arrangement. The friend became distant, leading the author to question if he's at fault.\n\nFrom a relational standpoint, the key issue here is consent and mutual understanding. The author claims the friend knew he was straight and that there was no romantic intent. However, the friend's actions as a gay person might have had different expectations or emotional investments. Even if there was an explicit understanding, the act of reciprocating might have been a breaking point for the author, which could have been confusing or hurtful for the friend.\n\nThe author's actions could be seen as leading the friend on, even if unintentionally. The friend might have felt that the arrangement was mutually agreed upon and that stopping it, especially after reciprocating, was a betrayal. The fact that the author's friends in another sub said he's at fault for leading the friend on suggests that the perception of manipulation or inconsistency in the author's behavior is a concern.\n\nMoreover, maintaining such a relationship with a friend, especially with a power dynamic where one person is always giving and the other is receiving, can create imbalance and resentment. The author's decision to reciprocate and then immediately stop might have been confusing, leading to the friend's cold response.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author might not have intended harm, but the impact on the friend is real. The friend's emotional reaction indicates that the end of the arrangement caused significant distress. Even if the initial arrangement was consensual, the lack of ongoing communication about boundaries and expectations might have contributed to the problem. The author could have been more proactive in managing the situation, perhaps by discussing the dynamics earlier on to prevent emotional fallout.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, while the author may not have malicious intent, the way the situation unfolded and the resulting harm to the friend's feelings suggests that the author is in the wrong. The key points are the imbalance in the relationship, the potential for the friend to feel used, and the lack of clear communication about the nature of their arrangement.\n"
