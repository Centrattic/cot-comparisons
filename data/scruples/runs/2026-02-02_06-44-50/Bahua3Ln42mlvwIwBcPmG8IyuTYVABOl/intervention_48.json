I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a straight, heteroflexible man who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend. They started when he was single, stopped when he got a girlfriend, then resumed after the breakup. The author then tried reciprocating but felt uncomfortable and ended the arrangement, leading to the friend becoming distant.\n\nFirst, the author's friend is gay, so engaging in sexual activity with a straight person might not align with the friend's expectations. Even though the author was clear about his orientation, the friend might have hoped for a romantic or emotional connection. The author's actions could be seen as using the friend for sex without emotional reciprocity, which can be hurtful.\n\nWhen the author reciprocated, it might have given the friend false hope, even if the author didn't intend it. Ending the arrangement afterward left the friend feeling rejected, leading to the cold response. The author's friends in the sub agreed it's their fault for leading the friend on, which makes sense because maintaining a sexual relationship without clear boundaries can create confusion.\n\nThe author's defense is that they were clear about their orientation. However, actions can sometimes speak louder than words. The friend might have felt used or that the author didn't respect his feelings. The fact that the author tried to make it reciprocal but then backed out could have been confusing and hurtful, even if done politely.\n\nConsidering the emotional impact on the friend, the author's actions likely caused harm. Even if the author didn't intend to lead on, the situation's dynamics might have made the friend feel that way. The author is now struggling with the loss of a friendship they valued, but that doesn't negate the fact that their behavior might have contributed to the friend's hurt feelings.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author should have considered the friend's emotional needs and established clearer boundaries from the start. Ending the arrangement abruptly without addressing the friend's feelings could be seen as inconsiderate. So, while both parties might have had good intentions, the author's actions likely caused the friend emotional distress, making them at least partially at fault.\n"
