I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario involves a straight male accepting sexual favors from a gay friend, then later ending the arrangement, which caused the friend to become distant.\n\nFirst, the author is described as heteroflexible, which means he's open to same-sex experiences but primarily straight. The friend is gay and initiated the sexual encounters. The author accepted because he was single and horny. Then, when he got a girlfriend, they stopped, which the friend was okay with. After the relationship ended, they resumed the activity. The author later felt bad and reciprocated, but then decided to stop, leading to the friend becoming cold.\n\nThe key points here are mutual consent and the nature of their relationship. The author didn't pressure the friend; the friend offered the service. The author later felt uncomfortable and ended the arrangement, which might have caused hurt feelings. The friend's reaction of being cold and distant suggests that he felt rejected or used. However, the author didn't lie about his orientation and was clear about his feelings from the start. The friend might have developed feelings, which the author didn't reciprocate, leading to hurt. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the arrangement or for leading the friend on.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, if both parties consented initially, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for changing his mind. However, the friend might feel betrayed or used, especially if he was emotionally invested. The author's actions, while not malicious, might have caused emotional harm. The argument is whether the author should have ended things earlier to avoid the friend's hurt feelings. Since the author tried to communicate the end of the arrangement politely, it's a matter of perspective. Some might argue the author is responsible for the friend's feelings, while others might say the friend should have known the arrangement wasn't romantic from the start.\n\nGiven that the author is straight and the friend is gay, the dynamic is about non-romantic, consensual sexual activity between adult friends. The author's decision to stop is his right, but the friend's reaction indicates he might have had unspoken expectations. Since the author didn't misrepresent his intentions and ended it politely, the blame might not lie solely with him. However, the friend's hurt feelings are valid, and the author might need to take responsibility for the emotional impact, even if unintentional. The key is that the author acted within his boundaries, but the friend's emotional response is a consequence of the situation. So, the answer isn't straightforward, but considering the details, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
