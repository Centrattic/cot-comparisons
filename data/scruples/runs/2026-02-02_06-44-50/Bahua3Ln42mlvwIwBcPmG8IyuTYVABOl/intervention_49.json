I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a straight/heteroflexible man who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then ended it, leading to the friend becoming distant.\n\nFirst, the author accepted the friend's offer of a blowjob. The friend is gay, so maybe he was looking for a way to have a sexual connection. The author was single and horny at the time, so they had this arrangement. Then when the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, which the friend was okay with. After the breakup, they resumed. The author then reciprocated once, felt bad, and stopped. Now the friend is cold and distant.\n\nThe author is confused because others said it's their fault for leading the friend on, but they claim they were clear they're straight and not interested in a romantic relationship. However, the friend might have hoped there was a chance for more than just a one-sided sexual arrangement. The author ended it, which could have hurt the friend's feelings, especially after reciprocating once, which the author then rejected. \n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The author didn't force anything; the friend offered, and the author accepted. But when the author stopped, it might have left the friend feeling rejected or used. Even if the author was clear about being straight, the friend might have developed feelings or felt that the relationship was more than just a casual encounter. The author's actions could be seen as emotionally damaging, leading to the friend pulling away.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author reciprocated once and then immediately felt bad might have confused the friend. Even if the author was upfront about being straight, actions can speak louder than words. The friend might have hoped that the physical reciprocation meant a shift in the author's feelings, but when it was rejected, it could have been a blow to their self-esteem.\n\nIn terms of friendship, the author is losing a close friend, but the friend's reaction might be due to feeling unappreciated or not respected. The author might not have considered the emotional impact of ending the arrangement, especially after the friend had already invested emotionally. \n\nSo, while the author didn't force anything and was clear about their orientation, the ongoing arrangement and sudden termination could have led to the friend feeling used. The author might be at fault for not managing the friend's expectations or not handling the end of the arrangement with more sensitivity, even if the friend is gay. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
