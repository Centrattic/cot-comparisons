I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4.

A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about him accepting a blowjob from a gay friend, then later canceling the arrangement when he felt bad. Let's break down the points.\n\nFirst, the author is straight but heteroflexible, and he's had oral sex with a gay friend who offered it. They did this a few times when he was single and then stopped when he got a girlfriend. Later, after a breakup, they started again, and then the author felt uncomfortable and stopped, leading to the friend becoming distant.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. Initially, the friend offered, and the author accepted. That part seems consensual. When the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, which is good because engaging in such acts while in a relationship might be a breach of trust. Then, after the breakup, they resumed, which the author later felt was wrong. \n\nThe problem arises when the author decides to stop again, leading to the friend being upset. The author's friends said he led the friend on, but the author claims it was clear he wasn't interested in a romantic relationship. However, the friend was providing a sexual favor, and when the author stopped, it might have made the friend feel rejected or used. \n\nNow, the author is wondering if he's in the wrong. The main issue here is whether the author's actions were respectful and clear throughout. If the author was honest about his orientation and intentions from the start, maybe the friend still went ahead with the arrangement expecting more. The author did communicate that he wasn't interested in more than the physical aspect, but the friend might have hoped for a deeper connection. \n\nThere's also the aspect of reciprocity. The author later performed oral on the friend but felt bad about it, suggesting he didn't want the exchange to be one-sided. However, changing the terms of the arrangement after reciprocating might have confused the friend. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, while the author did stop the arrangement for valid reasons, the friend's hurt feelings are valid too. The author might not be in the wrong legally or ethically if everything was consensual and boundaries were clear. However, the friend's perspective matters. The author's actions might have been a breach of trust or emotional support for the friend who was relying on that dynamic. \n\nBut considering the author was honest about his straightness and the arrangement was mutual at the time, perhaps he isn't in the wrong. However, the aftermath of the friend feeling cold and distant suggests that the author's actions had emotional consequences. The friend might have seen the arrangement as a form of emotional intimacy, which the author then withdrew. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the author's actions were manipulative or if the friend misread the signs. Since the author was clear about his orientation and the friend still chose to engage, the fault might not be entirely on the author. But the way the author ended things could have been handled better, leading to the friend's hurt feelings. \n\nI think the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because even if the initial actions were consensual, the ongoing arrangement without clear communication might have led to emotional harm. The author should have considered the friend's feelings and perhaps communicated more effectively when ending the arrangement. However, the friend might also have unrealistic expectations about the relationship. But given the friend's response, the author's actions did cause harm, making him partially at fault.\n"
