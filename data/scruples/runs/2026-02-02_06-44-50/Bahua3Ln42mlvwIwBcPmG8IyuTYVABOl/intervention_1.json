I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complex. The author is a straight guy who had a sexual relationship with a gay friend. They started when he was single, then stopped when he got a girlfriend, and resumed after the breakup. The key points are the consent, the dynamics of the relationship, and how the friend reacted after the author stopped.\n\nFirst, the author was explicit about his orientation from the start. He didn't pretend to have feelings for the friend. The friend was aware that it was a casual arrangement. When the author ended it, he did so politely. However, the friend became cold and distant. The author is now feeling conflicted because they used to be close friends.\n\nSome might argue that the author led the friend on by engaging in a sexual relationship without any romantic or emotional commitment. Even if it was consensual, the friend might have hoped for more, especially since he's gay and the author was a close friend. The author's decision to stop, while justified by his own feelings, could have left the friend feeling rejected or used. The friend's reaction of becoming distant suggests he felt hurt, which the author might be responsible for, even if unintentionally.\n\nOthers might say the author wasn't in the wrong because he was honest about his boundaries and ended things respectfully. The friend's reaction is his own issue, and the author can't be blamed for how the friend feels. But the fact that they were close friends and the author's actions disrupted that friendship points to a responsibility to consider the friend's feelings.\n\nThe friend's behavior of being cold and not engaging could indicate that he's upset about the rejection. The author might have not considered how his actions affected the friend emotionally, especially since the friend had a crush or deeper feelings. Even if it was a mutual arrangement, the power dynamic might have been unequal, with the author using the friend's affection without reciprocating.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author was honest about his preferences, the act of engaging in a sexual relationship with a friend who has feelings for him could be seen as leading him on, even if unintentionally. The author's responsibility to maintain the friendship after ending the sexual part might not be his fault, but the way the situation played out could make him partially at fault for not handling the friend's emotions better.\n"
