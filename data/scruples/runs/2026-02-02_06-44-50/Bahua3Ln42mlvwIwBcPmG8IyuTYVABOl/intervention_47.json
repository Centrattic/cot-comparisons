I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a straight guy who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then stopped when he got a girlfriend, and resumed when she dumped him. After reciprocating once and feeling bad, he ended it, leading to the friend being distant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement. The initial encounters were consensual, so maybe not wrong there. But when the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, which is good. Then, after the breakup, they resumed. The key point here is that the author is straight and the friend is gay. The author's friend offered the act, and the author accepted. There's no mention of pressure or coercion. \n\nWhen the author reciprocated, he felt bad and stopped, which shows he recognized his own feelings and boundaries. However, the friend is now upset. The author tried to reach out, but the friend is distant. The author claims it was clear he's straight and not interested in a relationship. \n\nThe friends' opinions say it's the author's fault for leading him on. The ethical angle here is about honesty and boundaries. Even if the author is straight, the act of engaging in sexual activity with a friend, even if reciprocated briefly, can create emotional complications. When the author ended it, the friend's reaction is understandable, but the author might have not considered the emotional impact on the friend. \n\nThe author might have led the friend to hope for more than physical interaction, even if unintentionally. By ending it, the author might have caused emotional distress. However, the author didn't lie about his orientation. The responsibility here is tricky. The friend initiated the encounters, so maybe some responsibility lies with him as well. But the author's withdrawal after reciprocating once could have hurt the friend's feelings. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's actions were consensual but may have lacked consideration for the friend's emotional state. Ending the arrangement after mutual agreement is acceptable, but the aftermath shows that the friend is hurt. The author might not be entirely at fault, but there's room for him to take responsibility and let the friend space to heal. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether leading someone on is the author's fault. Since the author clarified his stance early on, maybe he isn't in the wrong. But the act of continuing the arrangement after the friend's feelings were involved could be seen as wrong. However, since both were adults and the author communicated his boundaries, maybe it's not entirely his fault. \n\nConsidering all angles, the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because, despite being honest about orientation, the ongoing sexual encounters might have given false hope, leading to emotional harm when it ended. The author didn't consider the friend's potential emotional investment beyond physical acts.\n"
