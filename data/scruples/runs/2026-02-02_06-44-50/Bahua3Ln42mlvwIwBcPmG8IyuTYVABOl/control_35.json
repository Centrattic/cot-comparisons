I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4.

A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is a straight, heteroflexible guy who had a gay friend. The friend offered to give him blowjobs, and he accepted because he was single and horny. They did this a few times over weeks/months. Then, after getting a girlfriend, they stopped. When the girlfriend dumped him, they resumed the BJ arrangement. The author later felt bad, reciprocated by sucking his friend, but felt awful and told him to stop. Now, the friend is cold and distant, and the author is confused about whether he's in the wrong.\n\nThe key points here are consent, communication, and the impact on the friendship. Initially, both parties agreed to the arrangement. However, when the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, which is good. But when the girlfriend broke up, they resumed. The author later tried to reciprocate but realized it wasn't right and ended things. The friend's reaction is now making the author question his actions.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The friend's actions started consensually. The author didn't promise more than the friend offered\u2014no physical intimacy beyond oral sex, no emotional commitment. However, the author might have led the friend to believe there was a mutual understanding that the arrangement could continue indefinitely. When the author decided to stop, even if it was done politely, it might have left the friend feeling rejected or used. The author's decision to reciprocate and then stop could have caused confusion. Also, the friend's hurt feelings are valid, even if the author didn't intend to lead him on.\n\nBut considering that the author was clear about being straight and not interested in a romantic relationship, and the arrangement was mutual and consensual at the time, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, the abrupt end and the friend's emotional reaction suggest that the author might not have considered the friend's feelings enough. The author could have handled the cessation of the arrangement more sensitively. Even though the actions were consensual, the impact on the friendship is a factor. The author might be at fault for not managing the end of the arrangement with more empathy, leading to the friend feeling hurt and the friendship deteriorating. So, even if the actions were consensual, the way it ended could be the issue.\n"
