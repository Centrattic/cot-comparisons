I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for the situation described. The scenario involves two 18-year-old males where one (the author) is in a sexual relationship with his gay friend. The key points are:\n\n1. The friend offered a blowjob, and the author accepted because he was single and horny. The author identifies as straight but heteroflexible.\n2. They continued this arrangement for weeks/months.\n3. When the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, and the friend was okay with it.\n4. After the girlfriend dumped him, they resumed the sexual activity.\n5. The author then felt bad and reciprocated, but immediately regretted it and told the friend to stop, explaining it wasn't his thing.\n6. The friend became cold and distant, not responding well to the author's attempts to reconnect.\n7. The author is confused because others said it was his fault for leading the friend on, but he claims he made it clear he was straight and not interested in a romantic or emotional relationship.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider different angles. \n\nFirst, consent and boundaries: Both parties were adults and initially agreed to the arrangement. However, the author might have created mixed signals. When the author started a relationship with a girlfriend, they stopped the activity, which the friend was okay with. Resuming after the breakup might have been a mistake, as it could lead to emotional investment from the friend, especially if he's in love. \n\nThen, when the author reciprocated, it might have been a turning point. Even though the author tried to be honest, the friend might have felt rejected or hurt. The author's actions could have led the friend to believe there was a possibility of a mutual romantic or emotional connection, which wasn't the case. \n\nThe friend's reaction of becoming distant suggests he felt wronged or used. The author's initial acceptance and continuation of the sexual relationship might have given the friend hope for something more, even if the author didn't intend that. The author then ending the relationship abruptly after reciprocating could have caused emotional harm. \n\nOthers' opinions mentioned that the author led him on. Even if the author didn't mean to, the friend might have perceived the ongoing sexual relationship as a sign of interest beyond physical. The author's decision to stop suddenly might have been hurtful without proper communication.\n\nHowever, the author did try to be honest when they stopped, and they had a prior agreement that there was no romantic component. The friend's reaction could be a personal issue, but the author's actions might have been careless in not considering the emotional impact.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong for engaging in a sexual relationship that could lead the friend to expect more than a physical connection. Even if the author considered it casual, the friend's emotional investment and subsequent hurt indicate that boundaries were not respected. The author's decision to reciprocate and then stop might have been the final straw, causing the friend to feel used or rejected. Therefore, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
