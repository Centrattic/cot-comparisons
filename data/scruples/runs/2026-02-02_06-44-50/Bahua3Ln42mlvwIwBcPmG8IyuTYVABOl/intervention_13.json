I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation involves a straight-identifying guy who's in a sexual relationship with a gay friend, then breaks it off when he gets a girlfriend, and later when the girlfriend dumps him, they resume. The author then reciprocates but feels guilty and ends the arrangement again, leading to the friend becoming distant.\n\nFirst, the author is described as heteroflexible, which means he's open to same-sex encounters but isn't necessarily exclusively gay. The friend is gay, so he's interested in men. The initial part where the friend offers a blowjob and the author accepts is a bit tricky. The author says it was clear from the start he's straight, but maybe the friend felt that there was mutual interest beyond just a one-time thing. The author continued the arrangement for weeks/months, which could imply some level of ongoing commitment or expectation, even if the author didn't see it that way.\n\nWhen the author gets a girlfriend, they stop, which the friend is \"cool with.\" Then after the breakup, they start again. The key point here is that the author is using the friend as a sexual partner without any emotional commitment or reciprocation. The friend might have developed feelings or seen this as a mutual sexual arrangement, and when the author reciprocates once but then ends it, the friend feels rejected or used. The author's action of reciprocating and then immediately regretting it might have hurt the friend's feelings, leading to the coldness.\n\nThe friend's reaction seems hurtful, but the author's actions may have led to this. By engaging in the sexual relationship without clear boundaries and then stopping, the author may have led the friend on, even if unintentionally. The author's friends in the sub said it's his fault for leading him on, which makes sense because the friend might have felt that the author was using him without regard for his feelings. Even if the author didn't intend to lead him on, the friend's perspective is important here. The author's sudden decision to stop after reciprocating once could be seen as invalidating the friend's feelings, especially if the friend felt some level of emotional investment.\n\nAlso, considering their age (both 18), they're young and might not fully understand the emotional dynamics of such a relationship. But the author's actions, while perhaps not malicious, could have been careless. The friend might have felt that the author was taking advantage of his affection without considering the emotional toll when the relationship ended.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author probably is in the wrong because he engaged in a sexual relationship with a friend who has feelings for him, then abruptly ended it without considering the friend's emotional state. Even if the author thought it was just casual, the friend might have seen it differently, leading to hurt feelings. The author should have communicated better and considered the friend's perspective from the start.\n"
