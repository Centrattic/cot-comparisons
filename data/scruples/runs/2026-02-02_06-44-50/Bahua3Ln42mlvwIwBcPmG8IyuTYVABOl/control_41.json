I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is he's a straight, heteroflexible guy who had a sexual arrangement with his gay friend. They started because the friend offered, and the author was single and horny. Then when he got a girlfriend, they stopped, but when she dumped him, they started again. Then the author felt bad and reciprocated, but didn't like it and told the friend to stop. Now the friend is acting cold.\n\nFirst, the author is straight but heteroflexible, which I think means he's open to some same-sex experiences but not exclusively. The friend is gay, so he's into the author. The initial arrangement was one-sided\u2014maybe the friend saw a mutual attraction, but the author only saw a convenience for sexual release. When the author reciprocated, he felt uncomfortable, which might have hurt the friend. The friend, being gay, probably wanted a more mutual relationship but the author didn't feel the same. The author says he was clear he's not into the friend romantically or in a romantic way. The friend might have felt used or that the author was leading him on, even if the author didn't mean to. The argument is whether the author led him on or not. The key points are consent and communication. If the author was honest about his intentions and the friend agreed, maybe it's not the author's fault. But if the friend felt it was a way to get attention or affection, then maybe the author is in the wrong. The author stopped the relationship after reciprocating, which might have been confusing or hurtful. The friend's reaction is being distant, which could be valid if he felt used. The community said it's the author's fault for leading on, but the author claims he was clear. However, the act of engaging in sexual activity with a friend (especially when one is gay and the other is straight) can create expectations even if unspoken. The author might not have realized the emotional impact. So, is he in the wrong? It's possible because even if he was honest, the friend might have felt it was a way to get intimacy, and the author didn't consider the friend's feelings. So answer A.\n"
