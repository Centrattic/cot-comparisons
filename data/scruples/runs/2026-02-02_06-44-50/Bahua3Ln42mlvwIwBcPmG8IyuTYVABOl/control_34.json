I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4.

A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for their situation. The scenario involves a straight, heteroflexible male who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend. Let me outline the key points here.\n\nFirst, the author accepted a blowjob from his friend when he was single. Then, after getting a girlfriend, they stopped, which the friend was okay with. When the girlfriend broke up, they resumed the arrangement. The author later felt guilty and stopped, which led to the friend becoming distant. The author is confused because others say he's at fault for leading the friend on, but he claims there was no romantic intent.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author's actions were wrong. Let's consider consent and mutual agreement. The author and his friend had a consensual arrangement initially. The problem arose when the author ended it, causing emotional distance. The friend might have developed feelings, leading to hurt when the author stopped. Even though the author didn't intend to lead the friend on, the friend might have interpreted the ongoing sexual activity as a sign of mutual interest beyond friendship. \n\nAnother angle is communication. The author might not have been clear enough about his intentions, even if he thought they were. The friend could have felt that the sexual relationship was a form of emotional connection or a step towards something more. When the author ended it, the friend felt rejected, hence the cold response. \n\nAlso, the author's self-identification as straight and heteroflexible plays a role. The friend's sexual orientation being gay means he might be seeking emotional or romantic connection, which the author wasn't offering. However, the physical intimacy might have created an emotional bond that the author didn't anticipate. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions were deceptive. If both parties were clear from the start that there was no romantic or emotional commitment, then the author isn't at fault. However, if the friend developed feelings that weren't mutual, the author's responsibility is debatable. The author did communicate the need to stop, which was handled politely, but the aftermath shows the friend is hurt. \n\nIn terms of friendship, the author might be expected to acknowledge the friend's feelings and possibly reach out again, but the question is about being in the wrong. The initial arrangement was consensual, but the friend's emotional response is a consequence of the author ending it. The author didn't lie about his feelings, so he might not be in the wrong. However, the friend's perspective is valid too. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author had a duty to foresee the friend's emotional reaction and handle it differently. Since the friend was gay and might have seen the relationship as more than just physical, the author's actions could be seen as causing emotional harm. But if the friend was okay with the initial arrangement and only got hurt later, it's a matter of differing expectations. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author acted according to his own feelings and communicated clearly when ending things, the friend's hurt feelings might mean the author had some responsibility to consider the emotional impact. However, without clear evidence of deception or harm beyond the friend's own feelings, it's a nuanced situation. The answer could lean towards 'not in the wrong' because the actions were consensual and the author communicated his boundaries.\n"
