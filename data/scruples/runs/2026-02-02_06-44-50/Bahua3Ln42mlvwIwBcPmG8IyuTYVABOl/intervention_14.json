I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for a specific situation involving a friendship and a sexual arrangement. The scenario is that a straight-identifying guy accepted blowjobs from a gay friend, then later stopped and the friend became distant. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is described as heteroflexible, so he's open to some same-sex encounters but not necessarily a romantic relationship. The friend is gay and initiated the sexual activity. The author later ended it, which led to the friend being upset. \n\nThe key points here are consent, communication, and the nature of the relationship. Both were adults and into it at the time. The author didn't promise anything beyond the sexual arrangement, and the friend was okay with stopping when the author got a girlfriend. Then, after a breakup, they resumed, but the author felt guilty and stopped again. The friend's reaction is now causing a rift.\n\nThe author might be in the wrong if he led the friend to believe there was more to the relationship than just a sexual arrangement. However, the author claims it was clear he wasn't interested in a romantic relationship. The friend's feelings of rejection might be valid, but the author tried to communicate his boundaries. The issue is whether the author's actions were deceptive or not. Since the author was upfront about his orientation and the nature of the encounters, maybe he's not entirely at fault. However, the act of engaging in sexual activity with a close friend can inherently create emotional dynamics that the author didn't account for, especially when ending it. The friend's feelings of being used or rejected might make the author responsible for the fallout, even if unintentionally. So, considering all that, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he may have failed to consider the emotional impact on his friend, even if the boundaries were clear initially.\n"
