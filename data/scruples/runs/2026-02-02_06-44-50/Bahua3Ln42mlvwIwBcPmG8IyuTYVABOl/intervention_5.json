I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a straight, heteroflexible man and his gay friend engaging in a sexual arrangement. The author accepts blowjobs from his friend, then they stop when he gets a girlfriend. After the breakup, they start again, but when the author reciprocates by sucking his friend, he feels guilty and ends it. Now, the friend is distant, and the author is questioning his actions.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the initial agreement. The author was clear he's straight and not interested in a romantic relationship. The friend is gay, so maybe he's into men, but the dynamic here is about mutual sexual activity. The author's friend offered the blowjob, so the friend initiated the act. The author accepted, which could be seen as consenting to a sexual act. \n\nThen, when they start again after the girlfriend dumps him, the author reciprocates but feels bad and stops. The friend's reaction is coldness. The author is confused because he didn't want to lead the friend on, but maybe he did. The friends were close before the sexual arrangement started, and their friendship deteriorated after the author ended the physical relationship.\n\nThe main issue here is consent and mutual understanding. Both parties agreed to the arrangement initially. However, when the author reciprocates and then decides to stop, it might have caused emotional hurt to the friend. Even though the author didn't intend to lead him on, the act of reciprocating might have given the friend false hope or the idea that the author was entering into a more reciprocal relationship. When the author pulls back, it could be perceived as a betrayal or rejection, especially if the friend was emotionally invested beyond the physical aspect. \n\nAlso, the friend's reaction being cold and distant suggests he felt hurt or rejected. The author's actions, while consensual, might have crossed a line when he reciprocated and then stopped, which could have been confusing or emotionally damaging. The author's friend might have felt used or that the author wasn't honest about his boundaries from the start. Even if the author didn't mean to lead him on, the friend might have felt that the author was toying with his feelings, especially after reciprocating the act. \n\nAnother angle is the initial arrangement. If the friend initiated the sexual activity, and the author agreed, there's a mutual understanding. However, when the friend was in a position of giving and the author started to reciprocate but then withdrew, it might have created an imbalance or emotional expectation that wasn't met. The friend could feel that his actions were one-sided, and when the author tried to balance it by reciprocating, the author then pulled back, causing confusion and hurt.\n\nThe author's claim that he's straight and clear about that might not fully address the emotional aspect. The friend, being gay, might have had deeper emotional feelings that weren't acknowledged. Even if there was no romantic intention, the sexual acts could have had emotional implications for the friend. The author's actions might have led to emotional distress, making him responsible for not considering the friend's feelings beyond the physical act.\n\nMoreover, the friendship's deterioration after the author ended the arrangement suggests that the author's actions had a significant impact. The friend's coldness could be a result of feeling rejected or unappreciated. The author might have failed to maintain open communication about the nature of their arrangement, leading to misunderstandings. \n\nIn conclusion, while the initial acts were consensual, the author's decision to reciprocate and then stop might have caused emotional harm to the friend. The author's responsibility includes acknowledging the friend's feelings and maintaining clear boundaries. The friend's reaction is valid, and the author's actions, even if unintentional, could have led to the friend feeling used or rejected, making the author partly at fault.\n"
