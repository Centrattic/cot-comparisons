I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a straight guy who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then stopped, leading to the friend becoming distant. The key points are consent, communication, and the nature of the relationship.\n\nFirst, the initial act was consensual. Both parties agreed, so there's no issue there. The guy clarifies he's straight and heteroflexible, and the friend is gay. The problem arises when he starts a relationship with a girlfriend and stops the arrangement, which he then resumes after the breakup. When he reciprocates, he feels uncomfortable and ends it, leading to tension.\n\nThe friend's reaction of being cold and distant could stem from feeling used or unappreciated. The user might not have considered the emotional impact of their actions. Even though he was clear about his orientation, the friend might have hoped for more or felt hurt when the relationship ended. The user's friends on the sub said he led the friend on, which could imply a lack of clear boundaries or consideration for the friend's feelings. \n\nHowever, the user did communicate his limits and tried to resolve things politely. The friend's response is more about handling rejection, but the user might still be at fault for not foreseeing the emotional consequences. The main issue is whether the user respected the friend's feelings throughout, considering that the friend was providing a service that might have been emotionally significant to him.\n\nIn conclusion, while the user acted within his boundaries, he might not have considered the friend's emotional state, leading to the friend feeling undervalued. So, the answer is A.\n"
