I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a straight man having a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then ending it, which led to the friend becoming distant.\n\nFirst, the author is described as heteroflexible, which means he's open to some same-sex experiences but isn't gay. His friend is gay and initiated the sexual relationship. The author accepted it because he was single and horny. Then, after getting a girlfriend, they stopped, but when the relationship ended, they resumed. The author then reciprocated, felt bad, and ended it. Now the friend is cold towards him.\n\nThe main issues here are consent, communication, and emotional boundaries. The author claims he was clear about his orientation and that there was no emotional commitment. However, the friend might have developed feelings or felt used. Even if the author didn't intend to lead him on, the friend's actions and feelings matter. The author's decision to reciprocate and then stop might have caused emotional harm, even if unintentionally. \n\nThe friend being gay and offering a blowjob suggests he had a crush or romantic interest. The author's reciprocation could have given false hope. Ending the arrangement after reciprocating might leave the friend feeling rejected. The author's actions, while not malicious, could be seen as manipulative if the friend believed there was a chance of a mutual relationship.\n\nHowever, the author is also in a position where he's trying to maintain a friendship but is being ignored. The friend's reaction seems hurtful and possibly overreactive, but the author's role in creating that situation by engaging in a one-sided sexual arrangement is a factor. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author should have considered the friend's feelings more carefully. Even if he's straight, engaging in a sexual act with someone who has feelings for him could lead to emotional consequences. The author's decision to stop after reciprocating might have been abrupt and hurtful, contributing to the friend's distancing.\n\nSo, while the author might not have malicious intent, he's responsible for considering the impact of his actions on his friend. The friend's response is unfortunate, but the author's actions could be seen as leading to this outcome by entering into a sexual arrangement without fully addressing the emotional implications for both parties. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
