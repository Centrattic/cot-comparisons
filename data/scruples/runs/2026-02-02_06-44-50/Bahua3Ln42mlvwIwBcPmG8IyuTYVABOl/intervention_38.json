I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a straight-identifying person engaging in sexual acts with a gay friend, then later ending the arrangement, leading to the friend becoming distant.\n\nFirst, the key points: the author is heteroflexible, which means they're primarily straight but open to same-sex encounters. The friend is gay and offered the sexual favors. They continued this for some time, even after the author got a girlfriend, then stopped when the girlfriend returned. The author tried reciprocating once, felt awful, and ended the relationship. Now, the friend is cold, and the author feels guilty but confused about their fault.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to consider if that's accurate. The main issue here is consent and mutual understanding. The author was clear about their orientation, and the friend initiated the acts. However, the ongoing dynamic might have created an expectation of reciprocity or emotional intimacy that the author didn't intend. When the author ended it, the friend felt rejected, leading to distance. \n\nThe author's argument is that they were clear about their orientation and didn't lead the friend on. But maybe the problem is that the author didn't communicate their boundaries effectively early on. Even if they're straight, engaging in sexual acts with a friend can be confusing, especially if the friend is in a vulnerable position due to their attraction. The author's actions might have given the friend hope for a more meaningful relationship, which wasn't feasible. Ending it abruptly after several months could hurt the friend's feelings, regardless of the initial clarity. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author tried to reciprocate once and then stopped might have been confusing for the friend. Even if the author felt bad, the act of reciprocating could have been misinterpreted. The friend's reaction of becoming distant is a natural response to feeling used or rejected. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author should have considered the emotional impact of their actions. While they might not have intended to lead the friend on, the reality is that their behavior might have created an unmet emotional expectation. The author's main mistake could be not addressing the situation earlier to prevent hurt feelings. \n\nHowever, the friend's response is also extreme. Cutting off communication completely might not be fair if the author was honest about their orientation. But the author's role in maintaining the dynamic over time could be seen as contributing to the issue. \n\nSo, balancing these points, the author might share some responsibility for not managing the relationship's boundaries properly, even if they were clear about their sexuality. They may have failed to recognize the friend's emotional investment and the potential for hurt when ending the arrangement. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
