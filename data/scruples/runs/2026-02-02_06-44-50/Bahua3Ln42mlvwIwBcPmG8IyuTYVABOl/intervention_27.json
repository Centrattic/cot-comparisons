I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a straight-identified person engaging in mutual oral sex with a gay friend, then ending it when they start a relationship. Then, after the relationship ends, they resume the activity but later decide to stop, leading to the friend becoming distant.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: They accepted the friend's offer when they were single, continued after getting a girlfriend, stopped when the girlfriend was around, resumed after the breakup, and then tried reciprocating but felt bad and ended it. The friend became cold after that.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. The key points here are consent and communication. The author claims they were clear about their orientation and that there was no romantic involvement. However, the friend might have developed feelings or felt used, even if the author intended it as casual. The act of reciprocating might have given the friend false hope. Also, the author's decision to stop after reciprocating could have been hurtful. Even if there was prior understanding, changing the dynamic (like engaging in mutual oral sex) might have altered the friend's perspective. The author's actions might have led the friend to feel they were being used for sexual favors, hence the cold treatment. The author didn't consider the emotional impact on the friend, especially after reciprocating. So, the author might be at fault for not maintaining clear boundaries and for not considering the friend's feelings when ending the arrangement. Therefore, Answer A.\n"
