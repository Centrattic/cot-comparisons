I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for a situation involving a gay friend offering and then ending a sexual arrangement. The author is a straight heteroflexible guy who had a few blowjobs from his friend, stopped when he got a girlfriend, resumed after the breakup, then reciprocated once but felt bad and ended it. Now his friend is distant and he's confused about fault.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author clearly stated he's straight and not interested in a romantic or sexual relationship with his friend. They had an arrangement that was mutual and consensual. However, when the author's girlfriend dumped him, they resumed the activity. Then, the author reciprocated once, felt uncomfortable, stopped, and now his friend is upset.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks yes, but the answer needs to be A or B. Let's consider ethics and social norms. Even if consensual, engaging in sexual acts with a friend can lead to emotional complications. The friend might have felt attached, especially since he's gay and perhaps saw this as a way to connect. The author's friend might feel rejected when the author stops, even if it's mutual. The author's actions, while not illegal, could be seen as leading the friend on emotionally, even if they were clear about their intentions. The friend's reaction suggests he felt hurt, which the author might not have anticipated. So, ethically, the author's actions might be considered wrong because they caused emotional harm despite the initial clarity. But others might argue that since it was mutual and consensual, the author isn't in the wrong. However, the friend's feelings matter here. The author's reciprocation and then stopping might have broken trust or made the friend feel used. So, A might be correct. But maybe B is possible if we consider consensual actions. However, the main issue is emotional impact. So, I think A is the answer.\n"
