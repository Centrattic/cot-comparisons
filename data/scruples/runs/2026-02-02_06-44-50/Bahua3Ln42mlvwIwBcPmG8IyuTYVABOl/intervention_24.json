I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation described in the story.\n\nFirst, let's break down the situation. The author is a straight, heteroflexible male. He had a gay friend who offered to give him a blowjob. He accepted this multiple times over weeks or months. Then he got a girlfriend, and they stopped. After the girlfriend dumped him, they resumed the arrangement. The author later tried to reciprocate but felt bad and told the friend they should stop. Now the friend is acting cold and distant, and the author is confused because they were best friends before.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they want a confirmation.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The author is using the friend for sexual favors while maintaining that they are straight and not interested in a romantic relationship. The friend is gay, so there's a power imbalance here. The author might be exploiting the friend's affection or desire to help, while the author isn't offering anything reciprocal beyond the sexual act. \n\nWhen the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, which makes sense if they were using the friend to satisfy their sexual needs when single. Then when the girlfriend left, they went back to the same arrangement. This could be seen as treating the friend as a sexual convenience rather than a genuine friend. \n\nThe author tried to reciprocate but felt awful and stopped, which shows they realized it's not something they wanted. However, the damage to the friendship might have already been done. The friend's reaction (being cold and distant) suggests they felt used or manipulated. \n\nThe author's initial acceptance of the friend's offer might have led the friend to invest emotionally or physically, expecting some level of mutual respect or affection. The author's actions could have been leading the friend on, even if not intentionally, by not setting clear boundaries or acknowledging the friend's feelings.\n\nIn many cases, using someone for sex without a mutual understanding can be seen as wrong. Even if both parties are adults and consented, the emotional impact and the potential for one-sidedness can make it problematic. The author's friend might have felt unappreciated or devalued once the author stopped, especially after reciprocating once and then pulling away.\n\nThe author's argument is that they clarified their stance and tried to maintain the friendship, but the friend's response indicates hurt feelings. The author's actions might have caused the friend to feel rejected or used, which is a valid emotional response. The author's responsibility here is to respect the friend's boundaries and feelings, not just their own needs.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's behavior seems to have contributed to the friend's emotional distress. They might have been using the friend for their own gratification without fully considering the implications on the friendship. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not maintaining a respectful and balanced friendship despite the sexual arrangement.\n"
