I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a straight, heteroflexible guy who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend. The key points here are the dynamics of their relationship, consent, and communication.\n\nFirst, the friend initiated the offer, and the author accepted. Initially, there's no indication of coercion. The arrangement continued for some time, and when the author got a girlfriend, they stopped. After the breakup, they resumed. Then, the author tried reciprocating but felt uncomfortable and ended the arrangement. The friend became distant, leading the author to question if he's at fault.\n\nThe main issues here are consent, communication, and emotional impact. The arrangement was reciprocal and consensual, but the author ended it without fully considering the friend's feelings. Even if the author was clear about not being in love, the friend's emotional response suggests that the sexual relationship had emotional weight. When the author decided to stop, it might have left the friend feeling rejected or unappreciated, as the author's actions could be seen as using the friend's affection without reciprocating emotionally.\n\nThe fact that the author tried to maintain the friendship (like sending a long Christmas message) but the friend was cold might indicate that the friend felt hurt. The author's actions, while not malicious, may have disregarded the friend's emotional investment. Even if the author was clear about being straight, the sexual relationship could have created unspoken expectations of exclusivity or emotional support that weren't met when it ended.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't necessarily malicious, but the key is whether they were considerate of the friend's feelings. Ending the arrangement without addressing the friend's potential emotional needs might be seen as inconsiderate, even if the initial actions were consensual. The advice from others that the author led them on might be a bit harsh, but there's a valid point about the abrupt end causing hurt. So, the author might be in the wrong for not managing the end of the relationship with more sensitivity.\n"
