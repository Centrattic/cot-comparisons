I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The scenario involves a straight-identifying person having a reciprocal sexual relationship with a gay friend, then ending it, leading to the friend becoming distant.\n\nFirst, the author is heteroflexible, which means they might be open to some same-sex experiences but aren't exclusively gay. The friend is gay and offered a blowjob, which the author accepted. They continued this for a while, then stopped when the author got a girlfriend. After a breakup, they resumed the activity, but when the author reciprocated and felt uncomfortable, they ended it. Now the friend is upset and distant.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. Initially, the friend offered the blowjob, and the author agreed. There's no indication that the friend was pressured. When the author wanted to stop, they did so politely. The friend's reaction is now causing tension.\n\nHowever, engaging in a sexual relationship with a friend, even if mutual, can blur boundaries. The author might not have considered how ending the relationship could affect the friend emotionally, especially since the friend is gay and might have had stronger feelings. The author's actions could have led the friend to believe there was a deeper emotional connection, which wasn't there. The fact that the friend is now cold suggests he felt rejected or used. The author's responsibility here is to acknowledge that their actions might have hurt the friend, even if unintentionally. The friend's response is a personal issue, but the author's role in creating that situation by engaging in and then ending the relationship could be seen as contributing to the problem. So, the answer is A.\n"
