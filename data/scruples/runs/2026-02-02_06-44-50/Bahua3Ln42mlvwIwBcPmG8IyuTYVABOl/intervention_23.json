I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. Let me go through each point.\n\nFirst, the author is a straight, heteroflexible guy. He had a gay friend who offered a blowjob, and he accepted. They continued this for weeks/months. Then the author got a girlfriend, and they stopped. After the girlfriend dumped him, they resumed. The author then reciprocated but felt bad and stopped, explaining it wasn't for him. Now the friend is distant and unresponsive. The author is confused because others say he led the friend on, but he claims it was clear he's straight.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are consent and boundaries. The author didn't force the friend; he was offered and accepted. However, once the friend realized the author wasn't interested in a reciprocal relationship, he might have felt used or disrespected. The author stopped the arrangement, which could have caused the friend to feel rejected. Even if the author communicated that he's straight, engaging in a sexual arrangement where one party is providing a service without mutual emotional connection might have been problematic. The author changed the dynamic when he reciprocated, then stopped, which could have hurt the friend's feelings. The friend's response is to become distant, which is a natural reaction to feeling used or unappreciated. The author might have not considered the emotional impact on his friend, even if it was consensual. So, even though there's no coercion, the author's actions may have been inconsiderate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for leading the friend on and not respecting his feelings once the arrangement changed.\n"
