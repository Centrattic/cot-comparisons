I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a straight-identified male accepting sexual favors from a gay friend, then things getting complicated when the author ends the arrangement.\n\nFirst, the author is described as heteroflexible, which means he might be open to some same-sex interactions but not necessarily in a romantic or committed way. The friend is gay, so he's likely seeking emotional or romantic connection, but the author isn't in a position to reciprocate that. \n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. Initially, both parties agreed to the arrangement, and there's no indication of coercion. However, when the author ends it, the friend becomes distant and upset. The author tried to explain that his actions were clear from the start about his orientation, but the friend felt led on. \n\nThe author's actions might have given the friend false hope of a reciprocal relationship, even if the author was clear about being straight. The friend's emotional response suggests he may have developed feelings beyond just a sexual arrangement, which the author didn't reciprocate. \n\nEven though the author ended it amicably and expressed discomfort when reciprocating, the ongoing friendship might have led the friend to believe there was a deeper connection. The author's subsequent attempts to reconnect were ignored, leading to the friend's coldness. \n\nThe ethical question here is whether the author was wrong to start the arrangement knowing his orientation might not align with the friend's needs. However, since both parties consented and there was no deception about orientation, it's hard to say the author was in the wrong initially. The main issue arises when the author ends the relationship, causing emotional distress. \n\nBut since the author made it clear he's not interested in a romantic or sexual relationship beyond the initial arrangement, and the friend might have misinterpreted the dynamic, the fault isn't entirely on the author. The friend's reaction might stem from unmet emotional expectations, not the author's deceit. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the arrangement, especially since he tried to maintain honesty. The problem lies more in the friend's emotional response and misaligned expectations. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
