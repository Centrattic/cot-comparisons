I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a straight-identified person engaging in oral sex with a gay friend, then stopping and facing a cold response from the friend. \n\nFirst, the author is described as \"straight but heteroflexible.\" They had a sexual relationship with a friend, which stopped when they got a girlfriend. After the breakup, they resumed, then later stopped again, causing a rift. The friend became distant, and the author is confused because they thought the boundaries were clear.\n\nThe key points here are consent, communication, and the impact on the friendship. Initially, the author was clear about being straight, so maybe the friend understood the terms. But when the author started reciprocating, it might have raised expectations. Even if the author didn't intend to lead them on, the friend might have felt used or emotionally hurt when the author stopped. The author's decision to stop after reciprocating could be seen as a betrayal of trust, especially if the friend felt invested. \n\nThe author's friends in the sub said it's their fault for leading on, which makes sense because even with clear boundaries, ongoing sexual activity can create unspoken expectations. The author might not have considered the friend's emotional response beyond the physical acts. The friend's coldness could be due to feeling rejected or unvalued.\n\nEven though the author tried to communicate nicely, the friend might still feel hurt. The author should take responsibility for how their actions affected the friendship, even if their intentions were clear. So, there might be some wrongdoing in not foreseeing the emotional impact and not maintaining the relationship's boundaries after reciprocating.\n"
