I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a heterosexual guy who had a sexual arrangement with his gay friend, then stopped when he got into a relationship, but after a breakup resumed the activity, and then tried to reciprocate before deciding to stop again. Now the friend is distant, and the author is questioning if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is straight but describes himself as heteroflexible, meaning he might be open to same-sex experiences. The friend is gay, so he's interested in men. The initial offer and subsequent interactions are consensual, but the author later feels guilty about the power dynamic\u2014his friend giving oral sex and the author reciprocating. Then, after breaking up with his girlfriend, he resumes the activity. The key point is when the author decides to stop after reciprocating and feeling bad about it. The friend becomes cold, leading to the author's confusion about being the bad guy.\n\nThe subreddits mentioned say the author led the friend on, but he claims it was clear he's straight. However, the friend might have had feelings or expected something more than just a physical arrangement. Even if it was consensual, the emotional aspect could be an issue. The author might have been using the friend for sex without considering the friend's emotional needs, especially since the friend is gay and might have had romantic or deeper feelings. The author's decision to stop after reciprocating could have hurt the friend's feelings, making the friend feel used or rejected.\n\nAlso, when the author had a girlfriend, they stopped the arrangement, but after a breakup, resumed it. This might have been confusing for the friend, especially if the author's availability was conditional on his relationship status. The friend might have felt that the author's interest was only when it was convenient, not genuine. When the author tried to reciprocate, maybe the friend felt that the author was pretending to be more interested in a relationship, but then pulled back, leading to hurt and distance.\n\nEven if the author was clear about being straight, the friend might still have emotional investment. The author's actions could have been seen as exploiting the friend's affection. The friend's coldness is a reaction to feeling used, which the author might not have considered. The author might not be at fault in terms of breaking any rules, but ethically, using a friend for sex without considering their feelings could be problematic. The author's responsibility is to communicate clearly and consider the emotional impact, which he may have failed to do, leading to the friend's hurt feelings. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
