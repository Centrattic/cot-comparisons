I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author is a straight guy who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then ended it after getting a girlfriend and later when things changed again. Now the friend is being cold.\n\nFirst, the author initiated and then ended the sexual relationship. The friend was clearly into it, but the author stopped. The problem here might be communication. The author says it was clear he's straight and not interested romantically, but maybe that wasn't communicated effectively. The friend might have hoped for more than just a one-sided sexual relationship, leading to hurt feelings when it ended. \n\nAlso, when the author got a girlfriend, they stopped the arrangement, which makes sense. But after the breakup, resuming it might have confused the friend. Then, when the author tried to reciprocate, he felt uncomfortable and ended it. The friend's reaction is being distant, which the author is upset about because they were close friends before.\n\nThe key points are consent, communication, and boundaries. The author didn't force anything; he accepted the friend's advances. But when he changed his mind, he communicated that. However, the ongoing emotional impact on the friend might mean the author didn't consider how ending the arrangement would affect him. Even if the author isn't in a romantic relationship with the friend, the friend might have developed feelings or felt used. \n\nThe advice from others that the author led him on suggests that the friend might have misunderstood the nature of their interactions. The author's actions might have given the friend hope for something more, even if he didn't intend to. So the author could be at fault for not setting clearer boundaries from the start or not being more transparent about his intentions. \n\nIn terms of friendship, ending a sexual relationship can strain it, especially if one person is invested emotionally. The author might need to acknowledge the friend's feelings and take responsibility for how his actions affected the relationship. But since he's trying to reach out and the friend isn't responding, maybe the friend is still hurt and needs time or space. \n\nOverall, while the author didn't force anything, the lack of ongoing communication about expectations and the emotional impact of ending the arrangement could mean he's partially at fault. The friend's reaction is valid if he felt used or hoped for more. So the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the failure to maintain clear communication and consider the friend's feelings.\n"
