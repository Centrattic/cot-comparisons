I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for a situation involving a gay friend offering blowjobs, then the author accepting, later ending the arrangement, and the friend becoming distant.\n\nFirst, the author is a straight, heteroflexible male. He had a good friendship with a gay friend who offered a Blowjob. The author accepted, which seems like a personal choice, but then later, after getting a girlfriend and breaking up, they resumed the arrangement. Then, the author felt guilty and stopped, leading to the friend becoming cold.\n\nThe key points here: The author is engaging in a sexual activity with a friend, which might have been a mutual agreement. However, when the author ends it, the friend feels rejected. The friends are both 18, so maybe they're in a phase where boundaries and communication are still developing.\n\nThe author's main defense is that he was clear about his orientation and didn't lead the friend on. But the friend might have seen the arrangement as a form of emotional connection or more. The problem arises when the author ends the physical aspect without addressing the emotional impact on the friend. Even if the author wasn't leading on romantically, the sudden cutoff could hurt the friend's feelings, especially if they were emotionally attached. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that after ending the arrangement, the friend became distant. The author is now trying to reconnect, but the friend isn't responding. The community suggests it's the author's fault for leading on, which the author denies. But maybe the issue is about how the author handled the ending, not the initial agreement. The author might have not communicated the decision clearly, leading to the friend feeling rejected. \n\nSince the author stopped the activity abruptly and without further explanation, the friend's reaction is understandable. Even if there was no romantic intent, the friendship might have relied on that dynamic. The author might have failed to consider the friend's feelings and needs, leading to the breakdown. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't handle the situation with care, even if there was no initial deceit.\n"
