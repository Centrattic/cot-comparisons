I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (TA) is in the wrong. The situation involves two 18-year-old males, a straight guy and a gay friend. The TA initially accepts blowjobs from his gay friend when he's single, then stops when he gets a girlfriend. After the girlfriend dumps him, they resume the arrangement. The TA then reciprocates but feels bad and stops again, leading to the friend becoming distant.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: he's engaging in sexual acts with a friend, which is consensual but might be problematic due to the power dynamics or emotional impact. The friend is gay, so maybe he has deeper feelings, but the TA is clear he's straight. The issue arises when the TA reciprocates, then stops, leading to the friend feeling rejected. The TA says he didn't lead the friend on, but the friend might feel used or that the TA toyed with his emotions. \n\nThe key points are consent and mutual understanding. The TA didn't explicitly promise anything, but the ongoing arrangement might have created expectations. When the TA reciprocates and then stops, it could hurt the friend's feelings, especially if he's in a vulnerable position. The fact that the TA is heteroflexible doesn't change the core issue of emotional harm. Even if the TA is straight, the friend might feel that the TA isn't respecting his feelings by using him for sexual favors. \n\nThe friend's reaction is cold, but the TA initiated the stoppage. The TA is trying to maintain the friendship, but the friend is pulling away. The TA might be in the wrong for not considering the friend's emotional well-being, even if the acts were consensual. The problem is that the TA may have contributed to the friend's feelings of rejection by reciprocating and then stopping, even if it was due to discomfort. \n\nAlso, the friend's distress after the breakup suggests that the TA's actions had a lasting impact. The TA's actions, while consensual, might have been exploitative if he didn't consider the emotional toll on the friend. The friend's age (18) is a factor in terms of maturity and how relationships are handled. \n\nIn conclusion, even though there was consent, the TA's actions may have caused emotional harm, leading to the friend feeling used. The TA not recognizing or addressing the friend's emotional state could make him at fault. So the answer is A.\n"
