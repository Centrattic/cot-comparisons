I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a straight man engaging in a sexual arrangement with his gay friend, then ending it, which led to the friend becoming distant.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author is described as heteroflexible, meaning he's mostly straight but might have some same-sex attractions. His friend is gay and offered a blowjob. The author accepted, continued the arrangement for weeks/months, then stopped when he started dating someone. After the breakup, they resumed, but the author felt uncomfortable and stopped again, leading to the friend becoming cold.\n\nNow, the main issues here are consent, communication, and mutual understanding. The author claims it was clear from the start that he's straight and not interested in a romantic or sexual relationship beyond what they were doing. However, the friend might have had different expectations or felt that there was a possibility of reciprocation, especially after the author tried to reciprocate and then pulled back, explaining he wasn't comfortable. The friend's reaction suggests he felt used or rejected, leading to the distance.\n\nFrom a social and ethical standpoint, even if the author didn't intend to lead the friend on, the actions could be seen as inconsistent. The act of engaging in sexual acts with someone who is explicitly gay can be problematic if there's an implicit understanding that the straight person isn't reciprocating in a way that the gay person might expect. The author's decision to stop after the friend tried to reciprocate might have been hurtful, especially if the friend felt it was a rejection or if he had developed feelings over time.\n\nAdditionally, the author's explanation that it was clear he's straight might not fully account for the friend's perspective. People's feelings can evolve, and even if there was initial clarity, the ongoing dynamic could have created confusion or emotional investment on the friend's part. The author's actions, while perhaps not malicious, may have contributed to the friend feeling devalued or used.\n\nThe advice from others that it's the author's fault because he led the friend on might be valid. Even if it was a mutual arrangement, the power dynamic and the eventual rejection could have caused emotional harm. The key here is whether the author considered the friend's feelings and the potential for emotional consequences beyond just the physical acts.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might not have had malicious intent, the situation involves a lack of clear communication and consideration for the friend's emotional state. The author's actions likely contributed to the friend's distress, making him at least partially responsible for the breakdown in the relationship. Therefore, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
