I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a heterosexual-identified person, let's call him Alex, who has a gay friend, let's say Jamie. They start a sexual arrangement where Jamie gives Alex blowjobs. Then Alex gets a girlfriend, they stop, the relationship ends, they start again. Then Alex feels bad and reciprocates but feels awful, tells Jamie to stop. After that, Jamie becomes distant. The question is whether Alex is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The key points are consent, respect, and communication. Initially, there's a mutual agreement between two adults. But when Alex starts a romantic relationship, they stop the arrangement. That seems responsible. However, when the girlfriend dumps Alex, they restart the arrangement. That part might be problematic because maybe the friend felt used or that the arrangement was one-sided. Then Alex reciprocates, feels bad, and ends it. The friend becomes distant, and Alex is confused because they thought they were clear about not wanting a romantic relationship.\n\nThe main issue here might be about emotional manipulation or exploitation. Even if Alex is clear about their sexuality, maintaining a sexual relationship with a friend could be leading the friend on, especially if the friend is emotionally invested. When Alex reciprocates, maybe it gives Jamie false hope, even if it's brief. Then cutting things off could hurt the friend's feelings, leading to the cold response.\n\nAlso, the fact that they're both 18 is important. They're young and might not fully understand the emotional consequences of their actions. The argument that Alex led Jamie on by engaging in sexual acts despite knowing Jamie's feelings could be valid. Even if consent was mutual, the emotional aspect might be where the problem lies. Friendship dynamics can change after such situations, affecting trust and communication.\n\nAnother angle is whether the initial arrangement was a closed deal (just about mutual sexual acts without emotional investment) or if there was an unspoken expectation from Jamie. If Jamie thought there was a chance of a romantic or deeper relationship, then Alex's actions might have been misleading. But if it was strictly a physical arrangement with no emotional entanglement, then maybe not. However, the key is that after reciprocating once, Alex felt awful and ended it, which might have been a clear break for Jamie.\n\nThe people in the other sub said Alex is at fault for leading Jamie on. If the friendship was important, maybe Alex should have been more cautious about maintaining emotional boundaries from the start. The fact that Jamie is now distant suggests that the friendship has been damaged, and Alex might feel conflicted about that.\n\nIn terms of ethics, even if there's no romantic intent, engaging in sexual acts with a friend who has feelings for you can be considered inconsiderate. It's about respecting the friend's feelings and not using them for physical needs without considering their emotional state. So, there's a case to be made that Alex is in the wrong for not being mindful of Jamie's emotions and for not maintaining clear boundaries that would prevent hurting the friend.\n\nOn the other hand, if both parties were clear and mutual in their understanding, then maybe it's not Alex's fault. But the problem arises when the arrangement changes, and Alex's actions lead to Jamie feeling rejected or used. The key is communication and how both parties perceived the relationship.\n\nGiven that Alex tried to make things right by apologizing and reaching out, but Jamie is still distant, it's possible that the damage is done. However, the initial decision to engage in an arrangement that could lead to emotional distress might place the blame on Alex. So, considering all these factors, the answer is likely A (Alex is in the wrong).\n"
