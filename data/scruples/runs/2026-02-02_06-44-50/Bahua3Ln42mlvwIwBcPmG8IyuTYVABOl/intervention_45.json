I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nSo, the author is a straight, heteroflexible guy who had a good friend who's gay. The friend offered a blowjob, and the author accepted because he was single and horny. They continued this over weeks/months. Then the author got a girlfriend, and they stopped. After the girlfriend broke up with him, they resumed the sexual activity. The author later felt guilty and returned the favor, but then decided to stop, explaining that he's not into that. The friend became cold and distant. The author texts a long message, but the friend only replies briefly. The author is confused because he thought he was clear from the start that he's straight and not interested romantically, but others say he led the friend on.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The author and his friend were engaging in consensual sexual activity. The author later changed his mind, which the friend wasn't happy with. The author claims he was clear about his orientation. However, when he started a relationship with a girlfriend, they stopped, but resumed after the breakup. Then the author tried to reciprocate, which made him uncomfortable, so he stopped again. The friend is now upset.\n\nThe main issue is whether the author's actions were deceptive or manipulative. The author didn't hide his orientation, but he engaged in a sexual arrangement. When he ended it, the friend felt rejected. The author's friends say he led the friend on, but the author argues he was honest.\n\nIn terms of ethics, if both parties consented and were aware of each other's intentions, then the initial arrangement might be okay. However, the author might have not considered the emotional impact of ending the arrangement, especially if the friend had feelings beyond just a casual arrangement. The author's friend might have developed romantic feelings that weren't mutual, leading to hurt feelings when the author stopped. The author's attempt to reciprocate and then stop might have caused confusion.\n\nBut since the author was upfront about being straight and not interested in a romantic relationship, maybe he's not at fault. However, engaging in sexual activities can sometimes blur lines, especially if one person is more emotionally invested. The author's decision to stop might have been abrupt and hurtful, even if it was communicated kindly. The friend's reaction is part of the problem here.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he was honest from the start and both parties agreed, then maybe not. But if the author didn't anticipate the friend's emotional attachment, which could have been a responsibility to consider, then perhaps he did something wrong. But the friend's reaction is also a factor. The author might need to respect the friend's feelings and give him space, even if he feels wronged. The answer could lean towards the author not being in the wrong, but there's a nuance here.\n"
