I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a straight, heteroflexible guy who had a sexual arrangement with his gay friend, then ended it when he felt guilty. The friend became distant, and others say it's his fault for leading the friend on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is clear about being straight and not interested in a romantic relationship. They had a mutual agreement where the friend provided oral sex. After the author's girlfriend broke up with him, they continued the arrangement. The author later reciprocated but felt uncomfortable and stopped it, explaining his feelings. Now the friend is cold, and others think the author led him on.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, consent and communication are crucial. Both parties agreed to the arrangement initially, and the author didn't force the friend. When the author decided to stop, he communicated it clearly. However, ending a sexual relationship can lead to emotional fallout, especially if one person was more emotionally invested. The friend might feel rejected or used, even if the arrangement was purely physical.\n\nThe author's actions don't seem malicious. He tried to explain his feelings and even apologized. The problem arises from the friend's reaction and the lack of mutual understanding about the nature of the relationship. The author might not be in the wrong for ending the arrangement, but there's a responsibility to consider the friend's feelings, which the author tried to do by apologizing.\n\nOthers' opinions that he led the friend on might be valid if the friend developed emotional attachments that the author wasn't aware of. However, the author wasn't deceptive about his orientation or intentions. The main issue is the aftermath of ending a sexual relationship, which can be awkward and hurtful regardless of intentions.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's clear communication and lack of deception mitigate his responsibility. Since he didn't mislead the friend and stopped the arrangement when he felt uncomfortable, it's possible he's not in the wrong. However, the emotional impact on the friend is significant. But based on the information given, the author acted within the bounds of consent and honesty, so the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
