I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did something wrong in a situation involving a gay friend offering to perform a Blowjob, and then the author accepting, continuing the arrangement, and later stopping after getting a girlfriend and breaking up. The friend is now acting cold.\n\nFirst, the author is a straight, heteroflexible male. He accepted a Blowjob from his gay friend when he was single and horny. Then, after getting a girlfriend, they stopped. When the author's girlfriend broke up with him, they resumed. Later, the author felt bad and reciprocated, but then stopped again, explaining he's not into that. Now the friend is distant.\n\nThe key points here are consent, communication, and boundaries. The author and his friend had an arrangement that both parties agreed to, at least initially. When the author had a girlfriend, they stopped, which was appropriate. When the relationship ended, they resumed. The author then felt uncomfortable with reciprocity and ended the arrangement again. The friend is now upset, but the author feels he didn't lead him on.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author didn't force the friend; the friend initiated. The author was clear he's straight and not interested in a romantic relationship. However, the friend might have had different expectations or felt used. The author's actions might have been seen as emotionally manipulative, even if unintentionally. The friend could feel that the author used him for sexual favors without emotional commitment. The author's decision to stop after reciprocating might have hurt the friend's feelings, even if the author was honest.\n\nIn terms of morality, the author didn't force or deceive the friend. But the situation is complicated by the potential for emotional harm. The friend might have felt that the author wasn't being truthful about his feelings or was being inconsistent. The author's friends on the subreddit think he's at fault for leading the friend on, which is a common perspective because the friend might have hoped for more than a one-sided arrangement.\n\nHowever, the author was clear about his orientation and boundaries. The issue is more about expectations and how the friend perceived the relationship. The author might not be in the wrong, but he might be responsible for not managing the friend's expectations adequately. Since the friend initiated and the author was honest, maybe the blame isn't fully on him. But the emotional impact on the friend is significant.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is a bit tricky. The author didn't act wrongfully in terms of consent and honesty, but the situation's emotional toll might make him partially responsible for the friend's feelings. The answer leans towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because leading someone on, even if unintentionally, can be considered wrong if it caused harm. But if the author was clear and the friend misunderstood, maybe it's not entirely the author's fault. However, common advice in such situations often sides with the person who ended the arrangement, so the answer might be A.\n"
