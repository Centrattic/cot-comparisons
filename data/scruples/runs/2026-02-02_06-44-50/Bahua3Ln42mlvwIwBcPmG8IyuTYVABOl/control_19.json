I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the author, a straight heteroflexible male, had a good friend who is gay. The friend offered a blowjob, and the author accepted. They continued this for weeks/months. Then the author got a girlfriend, and they stopped. When the author broke up with the girlfriend, they resumed the arrangement. Eventually, the author felt guilty and tried to reciprocate but stopped it, explaining they weren't into that. Now, the friend is distant, and the author is confused about their role in this.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent, communication, and the impact on the friendship. The author claims that from the start, they were clear about not being interested in a romantic relationship. The friend initiated the sexual activity, and the author agreed. However, after the author ended it, the friend became distant. \n\nThe author argues they didn't lead him on, but maybe the friend felt there was a level of commitment or emotional intimacy that went unspoken. Even if the author wasn't romantically interested, the ongoing sexual relationship might have created emotional expectations for the friend. When the author stopped, it could have felt like a rejection, leading to the friend's cold behavior. \n\nThe author's actions might have been consensual and clear, but the friend's feelings could have been hurt regardless. The author might have responsibility in not considering the emotional impact on their friend, even if they were upfront about their orientation. The friend might have developed feelings beyond just the physical, or felt used. \n\nAlso, the author's initial acceptance of the offer, even if mutual, might have created an unspoken dynamic that the author didn't fully recognize. When they ended it, the friend might not have received closure or understanding, leading to resentment. \n\nBut the author did try to communicate and apologize, which is a positive step. However, the friend's reaction suggests that the author's actions caused significant emotional distress. The question is whether the author's actions crossed a line despite their intentions.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's tricky. The author didn't force anything, was upfront about their orientation, and tried to end it politely. However, the ongoing sexual relationship with a friend might have created expectations that the author didn't address. The friend might have felt that their affection wasn't reciprocated beyond the physical, leading to hurt feelings. \n\nSo, considering all that, while the author might not be malicious, their actions could have been perceived as leading the friend on emotionally, even if unintentionally. The friend's cold response indicates that they felt wronged. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not fully considering the emotional implications of their actions on the friend.\n"
