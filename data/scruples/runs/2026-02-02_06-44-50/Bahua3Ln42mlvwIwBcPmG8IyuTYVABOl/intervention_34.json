I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me go through the details again.\n\nSo, the author is a straight, heteroflexible guy. He has a gay friend who offered him a blowjob, and he accepted. They did this a few times over weeks/months. Then he got a girlfriend, and they stopped. The girlfriend dumped him, and they started again. Later, the author felt bad and reciprocated, but didn't enjoy it and told his friend they should stop. Now the friend is cold and distant, and the author is confused because he thought he was clear about his orientation and didn't lead the friend on. Others said it's his fault for leading on, but he didn't think he did. They were close friends before all this.\n\nHmm. The key points here are consent, communication, and boundaries. The author and his friend had a mutual understanding initially, so maybe the acts were consensual. But when the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, which was okay. Then after the breakup, they resumed. The problem arises when the author reciprocated, felt awful, and ended it. Now the friend is upset.\n\nThe main issue is whether the author led the friend on. The author claims he was clear about his orientation and that there was no expectation of a romantic relationship. However, engaging in sexual acts, even with mutual consent, can create emotional dynamics. When the author reciprocated and then ended it, maybe the friend felt rejected or that the author was using him. Even if the author thought he was clear, the friend might have developed feelings or felt the friendship was compromised. \n\nAlso, the author's actions might have created a dynamic where the friend felt used or that the author didn't respect his feelings. Even if the author is straight, the friend might have felt that the sexual encounters were a form of emotional connection that got severed when the author ended it. \n\nThe author's friend being gay might mean that the friend saw this as a way to have a connection, even if not romantic. But when the author reciprocated and then stopped, it could have hurt the friend's feelings. The author's actions might have led the friend to hope for something more, even if the author didn't intend that. \n\nAlso, the author's behavior after breaking things off\u2014sending a long message and trying to reconnect\u2014might not have been handled well. The friend's cold response could be a result of feeling hurt and not wanting to engage anymore. \n\nIn terms of fault, it's possible the author didn't communicate clearly about the nature of their encounters. Even if they were clear about not being romantic, the sexual relationship could have created expectations or emotional attachments. The friend might have felt that the author was using him for sex without considering his feelings, especially when the author later reciprocated and then ended it. \n\nThe author's decision to reciprocate might have been a mistake, as it could have made the friend feel like the dynamic changed, and then the sudden stop might have been jarring. Even if the author felt bad, the way he ended it might not have been sensitive enough, leading to the friend's hurt feelings.\n\nSo, considering all that, even though the acts were consensual, the author might have failed to maintain clear boundaries or consider the friend's emotional state. The friend might have felt used, and the author's actions, while not malicious, could have led to the friend feeling rejected. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not being more considerate of the friend's feelings and for not handling the situation with more care.\n"
