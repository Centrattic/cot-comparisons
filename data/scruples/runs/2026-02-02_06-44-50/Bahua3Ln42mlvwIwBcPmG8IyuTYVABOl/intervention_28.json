I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a male author in a same-sex sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then cancelling after getting a girlfriend and later breaking up. Let's look at the key points.\n\nFirst, the author is described as heteroflexible, meaning they have some level of openness to same-sex experiences. The friend is gay and offered a blowjob. The author accepted, which might be okay if both parties are consenting adults. But then the author got a girlfriend, and they stopped. That seems responsible because they were in a relationship.\n\nWhen the girlfriend dumped them, they resumed the arrangement. But after a few weeks, the author felt guilty and reciprocated by oral sex, then immediately regretted it and asked to stop. The friend became distant and cold. The author is now questioning if they're at fault.\n\nThe author argues that it was clear from the start they were straight and not interested in a romantic relationship. However, the friend is gay, so there's a potential for emotional attachment. The author's actions might have led the friend to hope for a deeper connection, which wasn't there. When the author reciprocated and then stopped, it could have hurt the friend's feelings, especially since the friend might have developed feelings over time.\n\nAlso, the author is trying to repair the friendship but the friend is pulling away. The subreddits suggested the author led the friend on, which the author denies. However, the dynamic here is that engaging in a sexual relationship with a friend who is emotionally invested can create unspoken expectations. Even if the author didn't intend to, the friend might have felt used or rejected when the author stopped.\n\nThe age is 18, which is legal in many places, but maturity might be a factor. The author might not fully understand the emotional impact of their actions. The key issue is whether the author respected the friend's feelings and communicated effectively. The author did stop and apologize, but maybe it was too late. The friend's reaction is understandable if he felt emotionally attached and then rejected.\n\nConsidering all this, while the initial acts were consensual, the ongoing nature of the relationship and the friend's possible emotional investment mean the author might have been inconsiderate of the friend's feelings. So, the answer is likely A (author is wrong) because they didn't maintain clear boundaries or consider the friend's emotional state beyond their own needs.\n"
