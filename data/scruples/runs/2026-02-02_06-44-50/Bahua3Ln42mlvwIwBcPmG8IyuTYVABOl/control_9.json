I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in a situation where he had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then stopped, and now the friend is upset.\n\nFirst, the author is straight but describes himself as heteroflexible. He had a friend who is gay and offered sexual favors. They engaged in this for a while. Then the author got a girlfriend, and they stopped. After the breakup, they resumed. The author then reciprocated once but felt uncomfortable and told the friend to stop. Now the friend is distant, and the author is confused because he thought he was clear that he wasn't interested romantically.\n\nThe key points here are consent and clarity. The author did not force the friend; the friend offered, and the author accepted. However, once the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, which shows some consideration. When he broke up, they started again, but then the author changed his mind. The issue is whether the author gave mixed signals. The friend might have hoped for more than a one-sided relationship, especially since the author reciprocated once. Even though the author clarified he's straight, the act of reciprocation could have led the friend to believe there was a mutual romantic or emotional connection. The author might not have been clear enough about his boundaries, leading the friend to feel used or rejected. The friend's coldness could be due to feeling unappreciated or emotionally hurt. The author needs to take responsibility for not maintaining consistent boundaries and for the friend's feelings, even if the initial actions were consensual. So, the answer is A.\n"
