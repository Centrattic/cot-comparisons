I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the author is a straight, heteroflexible male who had a gay friend offer a blowjob. They engaged in this several times over weeks/months. Then the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, but after the breakup, they resumed. Later, the author reciprocated but felt bad and ended things. Now the friend is distant, and the author is confused about who is at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent, communication, and boundaries. The author and the friend started this arrangement with mutual consent. The author was clear about their orientation and didn't lead the friend on in terms of romantic feelings. The issue arises when the author reciprocated, which made them uncomfortable, leading them to stop. The friend then became distant.\n\nThe friends were close before the sexual activity started. The author tried to communicate their feelings, but the friend is now unresponsive. Others have said it's the author's fault for leading on, but the author denies that. The question is whether the author is wrong.\n\nFrom a consent and communication standpoint, as long as both parties agreed and there was no deception about intentions, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, the fact that the author used the friend as a sexual favor without deeper emotional engagement might have affected the friendship. When the author reciprocated, maybe the friend felt the dynamic shifted, leading to hurt feelings.\n\nAlso, after the author ended the arrangement, the friend's coldness might be their own reaction to rejection or feeling used. The author might have handled the end of the arrangement abruptly, leading to the current tension. But the author tried to reach out and explain, so there's an effort to maintain the friendship.\n\nIn terms of ethics, if both parties were aware and okay with the situation, the author isn't necessarily wrong for ending it later. However, the ongoing friendship dynamics are affected. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values, but legally and ethically, if there was no coercion or deceit, the author isn't in the wrong. The friend might be taking it personally, expecting more from the relationship than the author intended.\n"
