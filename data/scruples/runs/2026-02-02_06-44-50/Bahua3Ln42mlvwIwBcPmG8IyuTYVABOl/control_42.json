I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author is a heterosexual man who had a friend who is gay. They engaged in a sexual activity (blowjobs) multiple times over weeks or months. When the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, and after the breakup, resumed the activity. The author then felt guilty and ended it, leading to the friend becoming distant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is straight, so engaging in a sexual act with a friend, even if it's a mutual agreement, can be problematic. The key points are consent, communication, and mutual understanding. The author claims they were clear about not being in love and not wanting a romantic relationship. However, by engaging in sexual acts, there might be an implication of a different kind of relationship than what was initially understood.\n\nThe friend might have felt that the author was leading them on, even if the author didn't intend to. The act of reciprocating (sucking him) and then ending it could have been confusing or hurtful to the friend, especially if there was an unspoken expectation of a return to the previous dynamic. The friend's reaction of becoming cold and distant suggests that they felt used or that their feelings were disregarded.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that their friend is gay, so there might be an emotional component for the friend that the author didn't fully consider. Even if the author is straight, the friend's sexual orientation might mean they had different emotional stakes in the relationship. The author's decision to end things could have left the friend feeling rejected or hurt, even if there was no romantic intent.\n\nThe people in the different sub said it's the author's fault for leading the friend on. That's a common perspective because the author's actions, while consensual, might have created an expectation that wasn't met. The author should take responsibility for the friend's feelings, even if they didn't mean to. The fact that the author had a girlfriend at one point and then resumed the activity after the breakup might also complicate things, as it could be seen as using the friend for sexual gratification when the author wasn't in a committed relationship.\n\nHowever, the author did communicate their feelings clearly when they ended it, so there's a case for them not being in the wrong if they were explicit about their stance. But the friend's reaction indicates that the communication wasn't sufficient to prevent hurt feelings. The key here is whether the author should have anticipated the friend's emotional response, especially given the friend's sexual orientation and potential deeper feelings.\n\nIn summary, while the author didn't act maliciously, their actions may have led the friend to develop feelings or expectations that weren't reciprocated. The author has a responsibility to consider how their actions affect others, even if the actions were consensual. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not fully considering the emotional impact on their friend.\n"
