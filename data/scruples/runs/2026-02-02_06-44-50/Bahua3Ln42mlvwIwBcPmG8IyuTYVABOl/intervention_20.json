I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves two 18-year-old males, one straight and heteroflexible, the other gay. They started a sexual arrangement where the gay friend gave the author blowjobs. Then when the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, but resumed after the breakup. The author felt bad and reciprocated once but then stopped, leading to the friend becoming distant.\n\nFirst, the author is straight but engaging in sexual activity with a male friend. Even though he's heteroflexible, the key issue here might be consent and mutual understanding from the start. The author claims it was clear he's not interested in a romantic or emotional relationship. However, the friend might have hoped for more or felt used once the author stopped reciprocating. When the author reciprocated once and then stopped, it might have caused hurt feelings, even if he was clear about his orientation.\n\nThe author then tried to reconnect but the friend became distant. The friends in another sub said the author led him on, which is a common accusation in such situations. The problem here could be that the author didn't set clear boundaries from the beginning or didn't communicate effectively when he decided to stop. Even if the author thought he was clear, the friend might have misinterpreted the actions as interest beyond just physical. The author's actions might have given the friend false hope, leading to feelings of rejection and betrayal when it ended. \n\nThe fact that they were close friends and did a lot together before adds another layer. The author might have created an emotional dependency without realizing it. The friend's reaction of becoming cold and distant suggests that he felt hurt and possibly used. Even if the author didn't intend to lead him on, the actions did create a situation where the friend felt rejected. \n\nAlso, considering their age, they might be more emotionally sensitive and the situation could have a bigger impact on their friendship. The author should have thought more about how his actions would affect the friend's feelings, not just his own. The key points here are consent, communication, and emotional impact. While the author might not have had malicious intent, the outcome shows that he caused harm, which makes him responsible for the friend's hurt feelings. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
