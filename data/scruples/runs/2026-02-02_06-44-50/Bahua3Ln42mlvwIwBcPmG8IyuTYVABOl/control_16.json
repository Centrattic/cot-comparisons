I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation. The scenario involves a straight, heteroflexible guy who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then things changed when he got a girlfriend and later broke up. The friend became cold after the author stopped the sexual activity, leading to the author's confusion and seeking validation.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: he accepted blowjobs from his friend when he was single and then stopped when he had a girlfriend. That seems okay at first glance, but then after the breakup, he resumed. Then he felt guilty and tried to reciprocate, which made him uncomfortable, so he ended it. Now the friend is distant. The author is questioning if he's the bad guy here.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. Both parties were adults (18 years old), and the initial arrangement was consensual. The author was clear about his orientation and boundaries. However, when the author reciprocated, he felt bad and decided to stop. The friend's reaction is now affecting their friendship.\n\nBut here's the catch: even if it was consensual, engaging in a sexual relationship with a friend can complicate the friendship, especially if one party is in a different position. The author may not have considered the emotional impact on his friend, even though he stated his boundaries. When the author reciprocated, it might have given the friend false hope or deeper emotional expectations that weren't met. The author's decision to stop after reciprocating could have hurt the friend's feelings, leading to the coldness.\n\nAnother angle: the author led the friend on by continuing the relationship after the breakup, then stopped. Even if the author was clear about his boundaries, the friend might have developed feelings beyond the physical, which the author didn't account for. The author's sudden change in behavior after reciprocating could be seen as breaking a pattern, leading to the friend feeling rejected or used.\n\nHowever, the author did try to explain and be respectful when ending it. The friend's reaction of becoming distant might be his way of handling rejection, not necessarily the author's fault. But the author's actions might have caused emotional harm, which could be seen as his responsibility, even if unintentional.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions might be seen as contributing to the problem, especially in not foreseeing the emotional impact on the friend. Even with clear communication, the nature of the relationship could have created expectations the author didn't meet. So, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
