I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation step by step. The user is a straight, heteroflexible guy who had a close friend who is gay. They had an arrangement where the friend gave him blowjobs. Then the user got a girlfriend, they stopped, the girlfriend dumped him, they started again. Then the user felt guilty and reciprocated, but felt awful and told the friend they should stop. Now the friend is being distant and the user is confused about whether they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I should consider consent and mutual agreement. If both parties agreed and there was no pressure, maybe it's not the user's fault. But the user says the friend offered it, so maybe it was mutual. However, the user is straight and the friend is gay, which could mean the friend had romantic feelings that weren't reciprocated. The user's friend might have hoped for a romantic relationship, but the user clarified he's straight and wouldn't love him. Still, engaging in sexual activity might have given the friend false hope.\n\nThen there's the part where the user reciprocated, which made him feel sick. The user stopped it, but maybe the act of reciprocating, even if brief, could have confused the friend. The user's friend might have felt used or that the user was taking advantage of his feelings. The user tried to reach out, but the friend is being distant. The community suggested the user led him on, which the user denies. \n\nThe key points here are boundaries and communication. Even if both parties agreed, if the friend has unrequited romantic feelings, the user might have been using the friend's affection without considering their emotional well-being. The user's actions, while consensual, might have caused emotional harm. Stopping suddenly after reciprocating could have been a shock to the friend, leading to the cold response. \n\nAlso, the user's friend might have felt that the user was only using their friendship for sexual favors, which can damage the trust and dynamic of a friendship. Even if there was no romantic intent, the sexual relationship might have created an imbalance. The user might have not considered the emotional impact on the friend, especially since the friend is gay and might have had deeper feelings.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user had to consider the friend's feelings. Even if they were clear about being straight, engaging in such a close, intimate act could have blurred lines. The fact that the friend was \"cool\" when they stopped after the user had a girlfriend suggests they might have been okay with the arrangement, but when the user reciprocated and then stopped, it might have been hurtful. The user might not have handled the end of the arrangement sensitively enough, leading to the friend's withdrawal.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user's actions, while maybe not malicious, might have been inconsiderate of the friend's emotional state. The user might have led the friend on by maintaining the sexual relationship without addressing the emotional aspects, leading to hurt feelings when it ended. Therefore, the user could be at fault for not being more mindful of the friend's feelings and the potential emotional consequences.\n"
