I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a straight/heteroflexible guy who accepted blowjobs from a gay friend multiple times, then when they stopped, he later resumed after breaking up with his girlfriend. After feeling guilty and stopping again, the friend became distant. The author is confused because others say he's leading the friend on, but he claims it was clear he's straight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The key points are consent, communication, and emotional impact. Both parties are adults, so consensual activities are part of it. However, the author's actions might have led to emotional harm despite his intentions. The friend might have developed feelings or felt used, even if the author didn't intend to form a romantic relationship. \n\nThe author mentions that he's heteroflexible, which means he's open to same-sex encounters but not necessarily interested in a relationship. However, the friend is gay and might have had different expectations. The author's decision to reciprocate and then stop could have been confusing or hurtful. Even if the author didn't lead on, the friend might have felt that the physical contact implied some level of romantic interest or commitment, which the author didn't reciprocate.\n\nAlso, the timing\u2014resuming the activity after breaking up with a girlfriend\u2014could be seen as using the friend for emotional support or physical needs, which might not be fair. The friend's cold response suggests he felt hurt or disrespected, even if the author tried to communicate clearly. The author might not be entirely at fault, but there's a case to be made that he didn't consider the friend's emotional state and possibly gave mixed signals, especially when he reciprocated once and then stopped.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions, even if consensual, caused harm without considering the friend's feelings. Since the friend is now distant and hurt, the author might share some responsibility. Therefore, leaning towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the emotional impact and possible mixed signals, despite the initial clarity of boundaries.\n"
