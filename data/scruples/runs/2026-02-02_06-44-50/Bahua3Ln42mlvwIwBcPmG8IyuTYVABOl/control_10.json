I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. Let me go through the details step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a straight, heteroflexible male who had a gay friend. The friend offered a blowjob, and he accepted. They did it a few times over weeks/months. Then he got a girlfriend, and they stopped. When the girlfriend dumped him, they resumed. Later, he tried to reciprocate but felt bad and told the friend to stop. Now, the friend is acting cold and distant, and the user is confused because they were close before.\n\nThe main issue here is about consent and boundaries. Both parties are adults, so the initial acts might be consensual. However, the friend might have developed feelings that the user didn't reciprocate. The user mentions that he was clear about being straight and not wanting a romantic relationship. But even so, the friend might have felt emotionally invested, leading to hurt when the user ended it. \n\nThe user's actions could be seen as using the friend for sexual favors without considering their emotional state. Even if it was consensual, the friend might have hoped for more, and the user's cancellation could have led to rejection. The friend's coldness is a reaction to that. The user tried to reach out, but the friend isn't responding, which shows emotional damage.\n\nThe user's defense is that they were clear about their orientation, but maybe the friend's feelings weren't acknowledged. The user might have not communicated effectively, leading to misunderstandings. The key here is whether the user's actions respected the friend's emotional needs. Since the friend is gay, maybe they saw a potential for a deeper connection, which the user didn't reciprocate. \n\nSo, even if the user didn't intend to lead the friend on, the actions might have done so. The user should take responsibility for the friend's hurt feelings and maybe give them space, as suggested by others. The answer might lean towards A (the user is in the wrong) because they didn't consider the emotional implications and ended the arrangement abruptly, causing the friend to feel rejected.\n"
