I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for a situation involving a gay friend, Blowjob arrangements, and then ending it. The key points are:\n\n1. The author (straight, heteroflexible) accepted Blowjob from a gay friend when they were single. \n2. They continued this over weeks/months.\n3. When the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, and the friend was okay with it.\n4. After a breakup, they resumed the Blowjob arrangement.\n5. The author later reciprocated but felt bad and ended the arrangement.\n6. The friend became distant, and the author is confused about being blamed for leading him on.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: engaging in a sexual act with a friend, then stopping, then resuming after a breakup. The friend is gay, so maybe he was looking for a more meaningful connection than just Blowjob. The author might have given mixed signals or not been clear about boundaries. When they reciprocated Blowjob, the friend might have felt it was a step toward a romantic or deeper relationship, which the author didn't want. The author ended it, but the friend felt rejected. The author's main defense is that they were clear about being straight, but maybe the friend thought there was a possibility of a relationship beyond Blowjob. The author leading him on could be the issue here. Even if they were clear, the ongoing Blowjob arrangement might have implied some level of commitment or emotional involvement. Also, the author resumed the arrangement after the girlfriend was dumped, which might have made the friend feel hopeful. When the author reciprocated Blowjob, the friend might have felt it was a sign of mutual interest, but the author then ended it. So, the author might have given false hope or not communicated their intentions properly. The friend being cold afterward is a reaction to being used or feeling rejected. The subreddits' advice that the author led him on makes sense. The author is in the wrong because they didn't maintain clear boundaries and may have manipulated the situation, leading the friend to believe there was a chance for more than Blowjob. The author's actions could have emotionally affected the friend, even if they were clear initially. So, Answer A.\n"
