I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation involves a straight guy who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then stopped after getting a girlfriend and later breaking up. Now the friend is upset and distant.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze each point. The author is heteroflexible, which means he might be open to some same-sex experiences but isn't exclusively gay. The friend is gay and offered the blowjob. The author accepted, which might be okay if both parties consented. But when the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, which was agreed upon. Then the girlfriend broke up, and they resumed the oral sex. \n\nThe key issue here is consent and communication. When the author started reciprocating by sucking his friend, he felt bad and stopped. He told the friend to stop, which might have hurt the friend's feelings. The friend is now distant. The author is confused because he thought he was clear about his orientation and intentions.\n\nThe friend might have developed feelings or expected more than just a casual exchange, especially if he's gay. The author's initial acceptance might have led the friend to believe there was potential for a romantic or more committed relationship, but the author never intended that. However, the author did stop when he felt uncomfortable, which shows he didn't want to continue. \n\nThe problem arises from the misunderstanding. The author might have thought it was a mutual, no-strings-attached arrangement, but the friend could have felt used or rejected after the author ended it. Even if the author was clear about his straightness, the repeated actions might have given the friend false hope. \n\nThe author's actions could be seen as leading the friend on, even unintentionally. The friend's reaction of becoming distant is understandable if he felt hurt. So, even if the author didn't mean to, his behavior might have been emotionally harmful. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. The author didn't force anything and stopped when he felt it was wrong. However, not considering how his actions affected the friend's emotions could be seen as inconsiderate. The author might be in the wrong because he didn't fully consider the friend's emotional state, even if he was clear about his intentions. The friend's feelings are valid, and the author's abrupt end to the arrangement without addressing them properly could be the issue. \n\nSo, based on the analysis, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he might have contributed to the friend's hurt feelings despite his intentions.\n"
