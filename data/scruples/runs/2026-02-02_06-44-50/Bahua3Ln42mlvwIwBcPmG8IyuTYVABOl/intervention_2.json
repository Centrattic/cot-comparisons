I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the author is straight but heteroflexible, and they had a gay friend who offered a blowjob. The author accepted, and this happened multiple times over weeks/months. Then they got a girlfriend, stopped the arrangement, and later resumed after the relationship ended. When the author felt bad and reciprocated, they realized it wasn't right and ended it. Now, the friend is being cold and distant, and others say the author led him on.\n\nThe key points here are consent, boundaries, and communication. The author and friend had an agreed-upon arrangement. The author didn't start a relationship but engaged in sexual activity. When the author had a girlfriend, they stopped, which they were okay with. However, after the breakup, they resumed. The issue arises when the author reciprocated and then ended it, leading to the friend's resentment.\n\nThe author claims they were clear about their straightness and didn't lead the friend on. However, engaging in repeated sexual acts might have given the friend false hope, even if the author didn't intend to. The author's friend might feel used or that the arrangement was one-sided. Ending the relationship abruptly, even if for valid reasons, can hurt someone's feelings, especially if they were emotionally or physically invested.\n\nThe author's actions could be seen as inconsiderate because they didn't consider the friend's feelings when ending the arrangement. Even if the author was honest about their orientation, the friend might have developed feelings or felt that the relationship was more significant than just a sexual one. The author's friend's cold response is a reaction to feeling rejected or disrespected.\n\nSo, while the author might not have intended to lead the friend on, their actions could have been hurtful. They didn't maintain open communication about the boundaries from the start, which could have prevented misunderstandings. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not being upfront about their intentions and for ending the arrangement without considering the friend's emotional state.\n"
