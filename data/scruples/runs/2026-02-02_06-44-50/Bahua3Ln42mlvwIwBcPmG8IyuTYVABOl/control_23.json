I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a straight guy who's into some guy friends for oral sex, then things get complicated when he gets a girlfriend, breaks up, and then the friend gets upset after the author stops the arrangement. \n\nFirst, the author is heteroflexible, which means he's open to some same-sex experiences but isn't gay. The friend is gay, which is important. They started this arrangement when the author was single and then stopped when he got a girlfriend. That seems okay because he wasn't in a committed same-sex relationship. But then when the girlfriend dumps him, they start again. The friend probably thought there was some level of exclusivity or maybe emotional connection here.\n\nThen, the author feels guilty after reciprocating and stops, which leads to the friend being cold. The author tried to reach out, but the friend is distant. Others said it's his fault for leading the friend on. The author argues he was clear he's straight and not interested emotionally. \n\nHmm. The key points here are consent and communication. Both parties initially agreed, but maybe the friend developed feelings over time, expecting more than just a casual arrangement. The author might not have realized the emotional impact his actions had. When the author reciprocated once, maybe that gave the friend false hope. Then, when he stopped, it felt like a rejection. \n\nEven if the author was clear about his orientation, the friend might have felt used or that the relationship crossed a line. The author's actions, while consensual at the time, could have led to emotional harm. The friend's reaction shows he felt hurt, so even if there was no explicit emotional commitment, the author might have been careless in how his actions affected the friend. \n\nAlso, the author's decision to reciprocate and then stop might have been confusing. The friend might have expected consistency in the arrangement. The author's guilt and stopping could be seen as a betrayal of trust. So, even if the author didn't intend to lead the friend on, the situation might have been mismanaged. \n\nIn terms of wrongdoings, the author might have been in the wrong because he didn't consider the emotional consequences and didn't maintain clear boundaries. Even if it was consensual, the friend's feelings were hurt, which is a valid issue. The answer might be A (Yes) because the author's actions, while not malicious, caused harm due to lack of communication and consideration.\n"
