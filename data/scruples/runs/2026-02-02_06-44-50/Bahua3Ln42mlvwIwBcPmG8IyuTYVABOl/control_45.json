I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the author is a straight guy who had a friend who's gay. They started a sexual relationship where the friend gave him blowjobs. Then the author got a girlfriend, stopped the arrangement, and when the girlfriend dumped him, they resumed. The author then reciprocated once, felt bad, and ended it. The friend became distant, and the author is wondering if he's at fault.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. Both parties were 18, so legally of age. The author didn't force the friend; the friend offered, and the author accepted. However, the reciprocity when the author tried to suck the friend might have made the friend uncomfortable, leading to the distance. The author tried to explain that he's not into that, which shows some level of communication.\n\nThe friend's reaction of becoming cold could be due to feeling used or rejected. Even though the author was clear about being straight, the ongoing sexual interactions might have created unspoken expectations the author didn't meet. The author's sudden decision to reciprocate and then stop could have been confusing or hurtful to the friend.\n\nThe community's response that the author led him on might hold some truth if the friend felt there was a level of emotional connection or hope beyond just the physical act. The author's actions might have been inconsistent with the friend's emotional needs, even if the author didn't intend to lead him on.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author should have considered the friend's feelings throughout. Ending the arrangement abruptly after reciprocating once might have been a shock. The author's attempts to reach out after were met with cold responses, indicating the friend's hurt. While the author isn't necessarily \"wrong\" in a legal sense, emotionally and socially, there's a responsibility to consider the other person's feelings. The friend's reaction is valid, but the author's actions contributed to the situation. So, the answer is A.\n"
