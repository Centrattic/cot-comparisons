I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that a straight, heteroflexible guy had a gay friend who offered him a blowjob. They did this a few times before he got a girlfriend, then stopped when he had a girlfriend. After the girlfriend dumped him, they resumed the BJ stuff. The author then felt bad and reciprocated, but after feeling awful, he told his friend to stop. Now, the friend is acting cold and distant. The author is confused because he thought he was clear about being straight and not having romantic feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement. The initial acts were consensual, right? Both parties agreed. The guy was clear he's straight and not interested in a romantic relationship, which the friend is gay. So maybe there's no deception there. But then, when the author reciprocated, maybe that's when things changed. He sucked the friend but then felt bad and ended it. The friend might have felt rejected, especially if he had feelings or if he thought there was a chance of a more reciprocal relationship. \n\nThe author's actions might have led the friend to believe there was a mutual sexual arrangement, which the author then broke by stopping. Maybe the friend felt used or that the relationship became transactional. The author's friend might be hurt because the dynamic shifted, especially after the author reciprocated once but then ended it. Even if the author didn't have romantic intentions, the friend might have felt that the relationship was undermined or that his feelings were not respected. \n\nAlso, the fact that they were close friends and the author considered him a best friend adds another layer. Ending the sexual aspect abruptly could have caused emotional distress, especially if the friend had developed emotional or sexual attachment. The author might not have considered how his actions affected the friend's feelings beyond the physical aspect. \n\nOn the other hand, the author tried to communicate his feelings and ended the situation amicably, but the friend's reaction was to become distant. The author is now trying to reconnect, but the friend is unresponsive. The author didn't lead him on by being clear about his orientation, but perhaps the ongoing sexual activity without a clear boundary might have created confusion.\n\nIn terms of accountability, if both parties consented and the friend was aware of the author's stance, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, the way the author ended the situation, especially after reciprocating once, might have been hurtful. The friend's reaction could be due to feeling rejected or not being respected. The author might have a responsibility to acknowledge the friend's feelings and possibly apologize, even if he didn't intend to lead him on. \n\nSo, considering all this, maybe the author is partially at fault because the actions, even if consensual, might have caused emotional harm. The friend's response is valid if he felt used or rejected. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong), but there's nuance. However, since the question is a yes/no, the answer is A.\n"
