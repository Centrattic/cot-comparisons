I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the user is a straight, heteroflexible guy who had a gay friend offer him a blowjob. He accepted, and they had this arrangement for a while. Then he got a girlfriend, and they stopped. After the breakup, they started again. Later, the user felt bad and reciprocated once, then decided to stop. Now, his friend is being cold and distant, and the user is wondering if he's at fault.\n\nSo the main issues here are consent, communication, and the impact on their friendship. Let's consider each point.\n\n1. **Initial Acceptance**: The user accepted the offer. Since both were adults (18), and there was no coercion, this part seems consensual. The user thought he was heteroflexible, so maybe he felt okay with it. The friend offered, he accepted. No problem there yet.\n\n2. **Ongoing Arrangement**: They continued this for weeks/months. Again, if it was consensual and both were comfortable, that's part of their dynamic. But the user later got a girlfriend, so they stopped. That shows the user was aware of boundaries when in a relationship, which is good.\n\n3. **Post-Breakup Resumption**: After the girlfriend dumped him, they started again. The user might have felt lonely or still wanted the attention. But here's a potential issue: the friend might have hoped for a romantic relationship, but the user was only interested in casual encounters. The user claims he was clear about being straight, but maybe the friend had different expectations.\n\n4. **Reciprocation and Stopping**: The user reciprocated once, then felt awful and stopped. This is where things might have gone south. The friend might have felt rejected or confused. The user's decision to stop was necessary for his own comfort, but it could have been hurtful to the friend.\n\n5. **Friendship Aftermath**: The friend became distant. The user tried to reach out, but the friend was cold. The user is now upset about losing a best friend. The key question is whether the user's actions (accepting the offer, continuing, then stopping) led to the friend's hurt feelings.\n\nNow, considering the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) framework, we need to assess if the user acted inconsiderately. The user didn't force the friend; the friend initiated. The user was clear about his orientation and boundaries. However, engaging in a sexual relationship with a friend, even if it's one-sided, can create unspoken expectations. The friend might have developed feelings or expected more than a casual exchange. When the user stopped, it could have been perceived as rejection, especially if the friend was emotionally invested.\n\nAlso, the user's decision to reciprocate once and then stop might have confused the friend. Even if the user's intention was to be fair, the act itself might have sent mixed signals if the friend was seeking emotional intimacy. The user's honesty in stopping was good, but the friend might have needed more clarity earlier.\n\nIn terms of fault, the user isn't necessarily \"wrong\" in a legal or moral sense if everything was consensual and he was honest. However, the user might be at fault in terms of the friendship dynamics. The user may not have considered the friend's emotional state, leading to hurt feelings. The fact that others said he led the friend on suggests that there's a perception of mixed signals, even if the user didn't intend them.\n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether the user's actions, while not illegal or malicious, inadvertently hurt a friend. In AITA terms, the user might be considered the \"asshole\" if the friend's distress is valid and the user didn't take enough steps to manage expectations. However, if the user was clear and the friend overstepped, maybe not. Given the details, it's a bit of a gray area, but the user might share some responsibility for not addressing the friend's potential emotional needs earlier."
