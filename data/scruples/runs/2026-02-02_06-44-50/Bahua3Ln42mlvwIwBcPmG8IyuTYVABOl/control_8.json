I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author is a straight, heteroflexible male who had a gay friend. They started a sexual arrangement where the friend gave blowjobs. The author later got a girlfriend, and they stopped. After the breakup, they resumed the arrangement. Then, the author felt bad, reciprocated, and then decided to stop, explaining it wasn't what he was. Now the friend is distant, and the author is confused about being in the wrong.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author led the friend on. The friend is gay, and the author is straight but heteroflexible. The author claims it was clear he wasn't interested in a romantic or emotional relationship. However, engaging in sexual activities can send mixed signals, even if there's no romantic intent. The friend might have hoped for more than just a one-sided sexual arrangement, especially after the author reciprocated. The author's decision to stop after reciprocating might have hurt the friend's feelings, leading to the coldness.\n\nEven though the author tried to explain things, the friend might feel used or that the relationship became transactional. The fact that they were close friends complicates things because friends have expectations of mutual respect and consideration. The author's actions, while perhaps not malicious, might have crossed a line by using the friend for sexual favors without considering the emotional impact.\n\nAdditionally, when the author reciprocated, it might have made the friend feel that the dynamic changed, and then the sudden stop could have been confusing or hurtful. The friend's reaction of becoming distant is a natural response to feeling hurt or disrespected. The author might have a point in saying they didn't lead on, but the actions still caused harm. So, considering all this, the author might be at fault for not considering the friend's feelings and the emotional consequences of their actions, even if they were clear about their orientation.\n"
