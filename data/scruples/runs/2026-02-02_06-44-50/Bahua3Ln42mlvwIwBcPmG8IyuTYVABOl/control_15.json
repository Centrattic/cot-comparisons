I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a straight guy who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then stopped when he got a girlfriend. After the breakup, they resumed, but then the author stopped again, leading to the friend being upset.\n\nFirst, the initial part where the author accepted the blowjobs. He's heteroflexible, so maybe open to some same-sex activity, but still considers himself straight. The friend offered, and they had a mutual arrangement. Then when the author got a girlfriend, they stopped. That seems okay because they probably wanted to maintain the relationship with the girlfriend and not have anything on the side.\n\nThen the girlfriend dumps him, and they start again. The issue comes when the author feels bad and returns the favor once, then stops. The friend gets cold. The author is confused because they were just friends before this started, and he thought he was clear about his orientation. The friend might feel betrayed or that the author used him, even if there was no emotional attachment. \n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. Both were adults, and the author didn't lead on emotionally. However, the friend might have hoped for a romantic relationship, but the author made it clear he's straight. The problem arises when the author stops, maybe without considering the friend's feelings. The friend might feel rejected or used. Even if the author didn't lead on, stopping suddenly could be hurtful. But considering the friend's own sexuality (gay), he knew the author wasn't interested romantically, so maybe it's more about the sexual arrangement. \n\nThe author tried to explain and was polite. The friend's reaction is coldness, which might be his own insecurity or feeling unappreciated. The author's actions were within their boundaries, but they might not have considered the emotional impact on the friend. However, the friend's behavior could also be a reaction to the rejection of the reciprocal act. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author didn't force anything. They were honest about their feelings. The friend might have misinterpreted the arrangement. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer might be B, but there's a nuance. The author could have handled the ending better, but they weren't manipulative. The friend's reaction is more about his own feelings. So maybe B.\n"
