I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on their situation.\n\nSo, the author is a straight, heteroflexible guy who had a gay friend. They started a sexual arrangement where the friend gave him blowjobs. Then, when the author got a girlfriend, they stopped. After the breakup, they resumed the arrangement. Later, the author tried to reciprocate but felt bad and stopped, leading the friend to become distant.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The author didn't force the friend into any activity. They had an understanding from the start that it was a mutual, consensual act. When the author realized they didn't want to reciprocate, they communicated that clearly. The friend's reaction of becoming cold and distant seems to be more about personal feelings or expectations not being met. \n\nSome might argue that the author led the friend on, but the author maintained that their orientation is straight and that there was no romantic involvement. The friend's actions in initiating the arrangement and continuing it despite the author's boundaries might also play a role. The author tried to mend things with a long message, but the friend's response was minimal. \n\nIn relationships, whether platonic or otherwise, communication is key. The author did communicate their boundaries, and the friend's reaction is hurtful. However, the author's initial acceptance of the arrangement might have created an expectation from the friend that wasn't met when the author changed their mind. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The author didn't act with malice, but maybe didn't consider the friend's emotional state enough. However, they did respect their own boundaries and communicated clearly. The friend's reaction is problematic, but the author isn't entirely at fault. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong. But there's a nuance here. The friend's actions and the author's initial acceptance could imply some mutual understanding. However, since the author communicated their limits and the friend chose to be distant, the main issue is the friend's response, not the author's actions. So the answer is B.\n"
