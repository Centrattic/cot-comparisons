I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. The scenario involves a straight, heteroflexible male who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then things changed when he got a girlfriend and later broke up. After that, they resumed the arrangement, but when the author reciprocated, he felt guilty and ended it, leading to the friend being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is straight but identifies as heteroflexible, which might mean he's open to some same-sex encounters but not in a romantic way. The friend is gay, so he's likely interested in the author for more than just the physical aspect. The author accepted the friend's advances multiple times, then stopped when he had a girlfriend, which the friend was okay with. Then, after the breakup, they resumed. When the author reciprocated, he felt bad and ended it, causing the friend to become cold.\n\nThe main issue here is the emotional impact on the friend. The author's actions might have led the friend to believe there was some level of emotional connection or mutual interest beyond just physical acts, especially since he's gay. Even if the author was clear about not being into the friend romantically, the ongoing arrangement could have made the friend feel used or rejected. The friend's reaction\u2014being cold and distant\u2014suggests hurt feelings. The author's attempt to explain through a long message was met with a short reply, indicating the friend's unresolved feelings.\n\nThe author's defense is that he was clear from the start about his orientation and didn't lead the friend on. However, maintaining a sexual relationship with someone who is gay, even if it's one-sided, can create emotional complications. The act of reciprocating and then stopping might have been the final straw for the friend. The author might not have considered the emotional investment the friend had, leading to the friend feeling hurt and dismissed.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, even if there was no romantic intent, using someone's affection for personal gratification without considering their emotional well-being can be problematic. The author's actions, while perhaps not malicious, may have caused significant emotional distress. The friend's decision to distance himself is a natural response to feeling used or not respected. The author's confusion about why he's in the wrong stems from not recognizing the emotional undercurrents in the friend's actions.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's behavior, though not overtly malicious, likely contributed to the friend's distress. The key point is the lack of emotional reciprocity and the potential for the friend to feel unappreciated or discarded. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he didn't take into account the friend's emotional needs and ended the relationship abruptly without addressing those feelings adequately.\n"
