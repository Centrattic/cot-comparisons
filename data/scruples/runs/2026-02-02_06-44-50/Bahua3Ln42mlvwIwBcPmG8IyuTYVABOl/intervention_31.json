I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a straight, heteroflexible guy who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend. They started when both were single, stopped when the author got a girlfriend, then resumed after the breakup. The author then reciprocated once but felt bad and ended it. Now the friend is acting cold, and the author is confused.\n\nFirst, the author's actions. He accepted the sexual favors while being in a relationship, which is a big no-no. Even if the arrangement was mutual and consensual, it's still cheating. When the girlfriend dumped him, he resumed the BJ stuff, which shows that the boundary was broken again. The fact that he then tried to reciprocate but felt uncomfortable suggests he wasn't fully comfortable with the power dynamic or the nature of the relationship. \n\nThe friend might feel used or manipulated, especially since the author kept coming back after breaking off, possibly leading to emotional hurt. The author's lack of clear communication about boundaries might have led the friend to believe there was a chance for a romantic relationship, which the author didn't reciprocate. The friend's coldness is a reaction to feeling betrayed or unappreciated. \n\nEven though the author claims he was clear about being straight, the actions of continuing the arrangement when in a relationship and then breaking it off could be seen as leading the friend on. The subreddit responses pointing out leading him on make sense here. The author's confusion about leaving the friend alone despite the cold treatment shows he might not have considered the friend's feelings properly. \n\nSo, the author's actions likely caused emotional distress, even if unintentionally. The key issues are cheating, inconsistency in boundaries, and not respecting the friend's feelings when ending things. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
