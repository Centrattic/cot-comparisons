I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a straight guy who had a sexual arrangement with his gay friend, then ended it, leading to the friend becoming distant. \n\nFirst, the author is described as heteroflexible, which means he's open to some same-sex experiences but isn't exclusively gay. The friend is gay, so the dynamic here might be tricky. The key points are:\n\n1. The author accepted the friend's offer of oral sex multiple times. Then, when the friend was dumped, they resumed the arrangement. Later, the author reciprocated, which made him uncomfortable, so he ended it.\n\n2. The friend became cold after this. The author tried to reconnect but got minimal responses. Others on a sub said the author led him on, which he denies, stating he was clear about his sexuality from the start.\n\nNow, considering consent and communication. The author might have been clear about his orientation, but even if he was, engaging in a sexual relationship with a friend can have emotional implications. The friend might have developed feelings beyond just sexual interest, especially if the arrangement was regular and exclusive. When the author reciprocated, that might have been a turning point for the friend, feeling used or not respected. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author had a girlfriend and then a breakup might complicate things. When they resumed the arrangement post-breakup, maybe the friend saw it as a chance for something more. But the author's decision to reciprocate and then end it could have caused emotional harm. \n\nThe friends were close, and the author might not have considered how ending the arrangement would affect the friend's feelings. Even if the author was honest about being straight, the friend's feelings and the nature of their relationship could mean that the author's actions were seen as exploiting their friendship. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might have a point about being clear about his sexuality, but the act of engaging in a sexual relationship, especially with a friend who is in a different orientation, can lead to unmet expectations. The friend might have felt that the author was using him, and the author's subsequent actions (ending the arrangement) could have been a blow to that unspoken emotional connection.\n\nSo, while the author might not have intended harm, the way he handled the situation could be seen as leading the friend on, even if unintentionally. The friend's reaction suggests he felt hurt, and the author might be in the wrong for not recognizing the emotional impact of his actions on the friendship.\n"
