A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complex. So, the user is a straight, heteroflexible guy who had a gay friend. The friend offered him a blowjob, and he accepted. They did this several times over a few weeks or months. Then he got a girlfriend, so they stopped. After the girlfriend broke up with him, they resumed the oral sex arrangement. Then the author felt bad about the friend always doing it to him, so he reciprocated but immediately regretted it and told the friend to stop. Now the friend is being cold and distant, and the author is confused because others said it's his fault for leading the friend on. He's wondering if he's the bad guy here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is straight, the friend is gay. The initial acts were consensual, but there's a question of whether the author led on the friend. The author didn't have romantic intentions, just sexual. When he reciprocated, he felt bad and ended the arrangement. The friend's reaction is now coldness, which is causing the author distress.\n\nSo, the main issue here is consent and mutual understanding. The author claims from the start that he's straight and not interested in a romantic or emotional relationship. The friend, being gay, might have had different expectations, perhaps hoping for a romantic connection. However, the author's actions, while consensual, might have created confusion. The fact that the author reciprocated once and then stopped might have left the friend feeling rejected or used.\n\nAnother point is the ongoing nature of the arrangement. Even after the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, which suggests he was aware of boundaries. But when the relationship ended, he went back into the arrangement. This could be seen as taking advantage of the friend's feelings, even if unintentionally. The author's decision to reciprocate once and then cut things off might have caused emotional harm to the friend, leading to the cold response.\n\nThe author argues that he was clear about his orientation, but maybe the friend still had unspoken expectations. The act of reciprocation (the author sucking the friend) might have been a turning point, making the friend feel that there was more to the relationship than just casual sex, only to be rejected later. The author's regret and immediate stop might not have been enough to prevent the friend from feeling hurt or manipulated.\n\nAlso, the fact that they are both 18 and close friends adds another layer. Friends engaging in sexual activities can complicate the dynamic, especially when one person is using the other for sexual purposes without emotional investment. The author might not have considered the emotional impact on his friend, even if he was clear about his feelings.\n\nIn terms of consent, the acts were consensual, but there's a question of whether the friend felt pressured or if the power dynamic was unbalanced. The author's own feelings of guilt after reciprocating suggest he might have sensed the friend's deeper feelings. The friend's coldness could be a reaction to feeling used or rejected, which the author might be responsible for, even if unintentionally.\n\nSo, while there's no malicious intent, the author's actions could have caused emotional harm. The key is whether the author was aware of the potential for the friend to develop feelings and whether he took responsibility for that. Since he ended the arrangement abruptly after one act of reciprocation, it's possible that the friend felt dismissed. The author might be in the wrong because he didn't consider the emotional consequences for his friend, even if he didn't intend to lead them on romantically.\n"
