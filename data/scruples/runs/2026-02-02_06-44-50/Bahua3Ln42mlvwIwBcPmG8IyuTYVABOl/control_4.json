I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a straight, heteroflexible guy who had a friend offer oral sex, and there's a back and forth with his friend's feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to understand all the points. The guy is straight but into some gay activities. He had a friend who was gay, and they had a sexual arrangement. Then he got a girlfriend, so they stopped. When the girlfriend dumped him, they resumed. Then he tried to reciprocate, felt uncomfortable, and told the friend to stop. Now the friend is distant, and he's wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nThe key points here are consent, communication, and emotional impact. The author says it was clear he's straight and not interested romantically. But maybe the friend felt led on or that the situation wasn't consensual. The fact that the friend is gay might mean he had feelings, and the author's actions, even if not romantic, could have caused emotional harm. Also, when the author reciprocated, he felt sick, which might have made the friend feel objectified or unappreciated. \n\nThe author is asking if he's the bad guy. The people in the sub said it's his fault for leading him on. Even if he didn't mean to, the actions of engaging in this sexual activity repeatedly could have given the friend false hope or expectations. The fact that the friend became cold and distant suggests hurt feelings. The author might not have considered the emotional investment the friend might have had, even if he was clear about his sexuality.\n\nAlso, the author's decision to reciprocate and then immediately regret it might have been confusing or hurtful for the friend. Even if he tried to explain it, the act of doing it and then stopping could have been damaging. The friend's withdrawal might be a reaction to being rejected again after getting close. \n\nIn relationships, even if they're not romantic, mutual respect and clear boundaries are important. If the friend felt that his actions were being used or that the author wasn't honest about his feelings, that could lead to resentment. The author might not have maintained clear enough boundaries, leading the friend to believe there was a chance for more than just a sexual arrangement.\n\nSo, considering all this, even if the author didn't intend to lead the friend on, his actions could have caused emotional harm. The friend's reaction indicates that he felt hurt, and the author's part in maintaining the arrangement despite knowing it might affect the friend's feelings could be seen as the wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A, that the author is in the wrong.\n"
