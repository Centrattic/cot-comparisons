A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The author is a straight, heteroflexible male who had a gay friend. The friend offered him a blowjob, and he accepted because he was single and horny. They continued this arrangement over weeks/months. Then the author got a girlfriend, and they stopped. After the author's girlfriend dumped him, they resumed the arrangement. Later, the author felt bad and reciprocated, but immediately felt awful and told the friend they should stop. Now, the friend is cold and distant, and the author is confused about their friendship and whether they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the author is wondering if they're the one at fault here. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nLet's break it down. The author claims to be straight but into some same-sex activity. The friend is gay, so he's attracted to the author. The initial arrangement could be seen as the friend offering something the author was willing to accept. However, when the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, which might have been okay. Then, after the breakup, they resumed. This part might be problematic because the author was single again, but the friend's feelings might have been more significant here.\n\nThe key issue here is consent and mutual understanding. The author says they were clear from the start that they're straight and not interested in a romantic or physical relationship beyond the specific arrangement. However, the friend is gay and might have had deeper feelings that weren't explicitly communicated. The author's decision to reciprocate and then stop could have been a trigger for the friend, making him feel used or that the author's interest was only physical and temporary. The author then tries to maintain the friendship but the friend pulls away.\n\nThe people in a different sub said the author led him on, which the author denies. But did they? Even if the author thought it was a casual arrangement, the friend might have felt that the author was taking advantage of his affection. The author's actions of continuing the arrangement after the breakup and then suddenly stopping could be seen as inconsistent or disrespectful to the friend's feelings.\n\nAlso, the author's friend being gay might mean that the situation is more emotionally charged for him. The friend might have had hopes or feelings that weren't acknowledged, leading to hurt when the author stopped. The author's attempt to reciprocate might have been a way to feel guilty or to test the arrangement, but it led to discomfort for both parties.\n\nIn terms of consent and communication, the author claims they were clear, but maybe not fully addressing the friend's emotional needs. The friend might have felt that the author was using him for sexual favors without considering his emotional investment. The author's friend pulling away is a natural reaction to feeling used or unappreciated.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't fully consider the friend's emotional state and the implications of their actions, leading to hurting a close friend. The key here is that even if the arrangement started as mutual, the friend's feelings were not respected when the author decided to stop abruptly after reciprocating, leading to the friend feeling rejected or used. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
