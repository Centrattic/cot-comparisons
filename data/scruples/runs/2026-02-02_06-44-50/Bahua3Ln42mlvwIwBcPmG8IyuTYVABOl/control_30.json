I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation involves a straight male who had a gay friend offer him a blowjob. They engaged in this over time, then stopped when the author got a girlfriend. After the girlfriend dumped him, they resumed, but the author then felt uncomfortable and stopped, leading to the friend becoming distant.\n\nFirst, the author is heteroflexible, which he mentions. That means he's open to some same-sex encounters but isn't primarily attracted that way. The friend is gay and initiated the sexual activity. The author didn't push for it; he accepted when he was single and later stopped when he felt it was getting too one-sided. He even tried to reciprocate once but felt bad and stopped. \n\nNow, the friend is upset and distant. Others say the author led him on, but the author claims he was clear about his orientation. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nI need to consider consent and communication. Both parties were adults, and the friend initiated the act. The author didn't misrepresent his feelings; he said he's straight and not interested in a romantic relationship. However, continuing the arrangement after the friend was aware of the author's orientation might have led to mixed signals. The author did try to end it, but the friend's reaction suggests hurt feelings. \n\nBut the key points are: the friend initiated, the author was clear about his orientation, and the author ended the arrangement when he felt uncomfortable. The friend's reaction is more about unrequited feelings or possible emotional attachment, but the author didn't promise anything beyond physical interaction. \n\nSo, while the author could have been more careful in managing expectations, he didn't force anything and was honest. The friend's distress might stem from his own unmet emotional needs rather than the author's deceit. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
