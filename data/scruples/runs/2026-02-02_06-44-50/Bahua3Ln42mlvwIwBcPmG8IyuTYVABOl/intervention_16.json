I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The scenario involves a straight guy who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then stopped after getting a girlfriend and later when the girlfriend left. Now the friend is upset and distant.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: He accepted oral sex from his friend when he was single, which he admits is heteroflexible. But when he got a girlfriend, they stopped, which seems okay. Then after the breakup, they resumed. The key point here is that the author is straight, but engaging in sexual activity with another man, which is consensual but might be problematic in terms of emotional dynamics.\n\nWhen the author's friend tried to reciprocate by performing oral sex on him, the author felt uncomfortable and stopped, explaining he's not into that. Then the friend became cold. The author is confused because he thought he made it clear he's not interested romantically, just physically. Others said he led the friend on, but he denies that.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Consensual sexual activity is legal and generally not the issue, but emotional aspects matter. The friend might have hoped for a deeper connection, especially after the author's girlfriend left. When the author stopped the reciprocal act, it might have hurt the friend's feelings, leading to the coldness. The author's initial acceptance of oral sex could be seen as leading the friend on, even if he's straight, because the friend might have felt there was potential for a more meaningful relationship. The author then ended the physical relationship, possibly without considering the emotional impact on the friend. The friend's reaction suggests he felt rejected or used. So, the author might be in the wrong for not being clear about the nature of their relationship and for potentially misleading the friend about his intentions, even if they were only physical at first. The fact that the author felt okay about the arrangement but the friend was upset points to a miscommunication or unmet expectations. Therefore, the answer is likely A.\n"
