I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for a situation involving a friend. Let me read through the details again.\n\nSo, the author is a straight, heteroflexible guy. He had a gay friend who offered a blowjob, and he accepted. They continued this for weeks/months. Then the author got a girlfriend, and they stopped. After the girlfriend dumped him, they resumed. Later, the author reciprocated but felt bad and told the friend to stop. The friend became distant, and now the author is wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the key points here are consent and boundaries. The author and the friend engaged in consensual activities. However, the author later changed his mind and communicated that clearly. The friend's reaction is now causing tension. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nThe author's actions: initially, he accepted the friend's offer, which was consensual. Then, when he had a girlfriend, he stopped, which is responsible. After the breakup, they resumed. Then, the author felt guilty about the power dynamic (friend always giving, author receiving) and tried to reciprocate but felt uncomfortable and ended it. He clearly communicated his boundaries.\n\nThe friend became cold, which could be due to feeling used or not wanting to stop. The author tried to reach out, but the friend was unresponsive. The author is now upset because he considers the friend a best friend and feels it's not his fault. Others said he led the friend on, but he claims it was clear he's straight and not interested romantically.\n\nNow, considering the ages (both 18), they're adults capable of making their own decisions. The author didn't force anything; he engaged consensually. When he felt it was wrong, he stopped and communicated that. The issue might be that the friend might have developed feelings or felt the arrangement was one-sided. The author's actions were within his boundaries, and he respected them when he felt it was necessary. The friend's reaction is perhaps a result of unmet expectations or emotional investment, but the author isn't necessarily at fault for setting clear boundaries and stopping when he felt it was right. So, answer B: No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
