I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is in a situation where he's a straight, heteroflexible guy. His gay friend offered him a blowjob, and he accepted. They did this multiple times over a period of weeks/months. Then he got a girlfriend, and they stopped, which his friend was okay with. When the author broke up with his girlfriend, they resumed. Later, the author decided to reciprocate but felt bad and told the friend they should stop. Now the friend is acting cold and distant, and the author is confused about his responsibility here.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let's consider the key points. \n\n1. Consent was mutual initially. The author didn't force anything; it was the friend's initiative. However, the author's friend is gay, which means he might have had emotional attachments or expectations that the author didn't consider. \n\n2. The author's friend might have seen this as more than just a casual arrangement. Even if the author clarified he's straight and not interested in a relationship, the act of engaging in sexual activity could have led the friend to believe there was a reciprocal emotional connection, especially since they were close friends.\n\n3. When the author reciprocated, it might have been a turning point. The friend could have felt used or that the author wasn't honest about his feelings. The author's decision to stop after reciprocating might have hurt the friend's feelings, leading to the cold response.\n\n4. Communication is a big factor here. The author said he was clear from the start about his orientation, but maybe the friend still had unspoken expectations. The author's friend might have wanted a more meaningful relationship, and the author's actions (engaging in sex without romantic commitment) could have been seen as leading him on, even if unintentionally.\n\n5. The aftermath shows the friend is hurt. The author's attempts to reconnect are met with distance, indicating the friend feels wronged. The author's actions may have caused emotional distress, regardless of intent.\n\n6. The community's input suggests the author led the friend on, which he denies. But even if he didn't mean to, the friend's perspective matters. The author might not have considered the emotional impact of their arrangement on the friend, especially since the friend is gay and might have had feelings.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, while there's no coercion, the situation involves emotional harm. The author's actions, though consensual, may have disregarded the friend's potential emotional needs. The friend's feelings of being used or unrequited could justify his reaction. The author's responsibility here includes acknowledging the hurt caused and respecting the friend's boundaries now that the relationship is strained.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions, while not illegal or forced, may have unintentionally led to emotional harm. The key is whether the author should have foreseen the friend's feelings and managed expectations better. Since the friend is gay and likely had emotional investment, the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate, even if he didn't intend to lead him on. Therefore, the answer could lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because of the resulting emotional harm and the friend's perspective.\n"
