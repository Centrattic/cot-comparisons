I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on their situation. The situation involves a straight guy engaging in oral sex with his gay friend when he was single, then stopping when he got a girlfriend. After the girlfriend dumped him, they resumed, but then the author stopped again after reciprocating, which made him feel uncomfortable. Now the friend is distant, and others say it's the author's fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is heteroflexible, which means he's open to some same-sex experiences but identifies as straight. The friend is gay, so he's likely seeking emotional or physical connection. The key points are consent and communication. Initially, both agreed to the arrangement, but when the author had a girlfriend, they stopped. That seems respectful. Then, after the breakup, they resumed, which might have been okay at the time. \n\nThe turning point is when the author reciprocated by performing oral sex on the friend. He felt bad afterward and stopped, which might have left the friend confused or hurt. The author claims he made it clear he's straight and not interested in a romantic relationship. However, the friend might have felt used or that the author was taking advantage of his affection. Even if there was clear communication, the act of reciprocating might have sent mixed signals, making the friend feel like there's a two-way expectation that wasn't there. \n\nAlso, the author is now trying to reconnect, but the friend is pulling away. The original advice from others suggests that leading someone on is wrong. The author might have created an expectation that wasn't sustainable, especially since he's not interested in a deeper relationship. The friend's coldness could be a result of feeling unappreciated or rejected after the reciprocation. \n\nConsidering consent and mutual agreement, the initial actions weren't wrong. However, the aftermath\u2014especially after reciprocating\u2014might have caused emotional harm. The author didn't communicate his discomfort clearly enough, leading the friend to feel used. The fact that the friend is a best friend adds another layer; the author might have ignored the friend's emotional needs by not addressing the situation more sensitively. \n\nSo, the author's mistake might be not being clear about his boundaries from the start of the oral sex arrangement, leading to confusion and hurt when he pulled away. Even though he's straight, the friend's feelings matter, and the author's actions, while consensual, might have been inconsiderate of the friend's emotional state. Therefore, the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong).\n"
