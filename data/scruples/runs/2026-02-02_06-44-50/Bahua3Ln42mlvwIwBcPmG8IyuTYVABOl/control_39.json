I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a heterosexual-identified person engaging in oral sex with a gay friend, then stopping, leading to the friend becoming distant.\n\nFirst, the author is described as heteroflexible, which means they might be open to same-sex encounters but still identify as primarily straight. The friend is gay and initiated the sexual arrangement. The author accepted it, then later stopped after getting a girlfriend and again after the breakup. When the author reciprocated, they felt uncomfortable and ended the arrangement. The friend became cold, leading to the author's confusion about who is at fault.\n\nI need to consider consent and mutual understanding. The author mentions that the friend was okay with stopping when the author had a girlfriend. The arrangement was mutual at first, but the author felt bad and ended it. However, the author didn't provide clear communication about not reciprocating, which might have left the friend feeling rejected or used. The author's friend might have felt that the author was leading them on, even if the author didn't intend to. The author's actions could be seen as inconsistent\u2014engaging in the relationship and then abruptly stopping, which can be hurtful regardless of the initial understanding.\n\nThe key points are the lack of clear boundaries from the author, the abrupt ending, and the friend's emotional response. Even if the author didn't plan to reciprocate, the act of stopping without managing expectations might have caused the friend's cold behavior. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't communicate their intentions clearly and ended the arrangement without considering the friend's feelings, especially after building a sexual relationship. The friend's reaction could be a result of feeling used or not valued after the relationship ended. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
