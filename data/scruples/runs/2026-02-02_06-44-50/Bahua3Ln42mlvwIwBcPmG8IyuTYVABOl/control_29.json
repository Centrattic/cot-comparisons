I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for a series of events involving a gay friend offering and performing blowjobs, then the author canceling the arrangement after things changed.\n\nFirst, the author is straight and heteroflexible. They had a close friend who is gay and offered oral sex. The author accepted because they were single and horny. Over time, they engaged in this multiple times. Then the author got a girlfriend, and they stopped. When the relationship ended, they resumed the activity. Later, the author felt guilty and reciprocated, but then decided to stop it again. The friend became distant, and the author is now questioning their actions.\n\nThe key points here are consent and clear boundaries. The author didn't engage in the act under false pretenses; they were upfront about their sexual orientation and the nature of their interest. However, the friend might have had different expectations or emotional attachments. When the author reciprocated, it could have signaled a shift in the dynamic that the friend wasn't expecting, leading to feelings of rejection or betrayal.\n\nEven though the author was honest about their preferences, the ongoing exchange might have given the friend hope for a romantic or emotional connection that the author wasn't interested in. The author's decision to stop, especially after reciprocating, might have hurt the friend's feelings, even if the author's intentions were clear. The friend's reaction of becoming cold and distant suggests that the interaction affected their emotional state negatively.\n\nThe author's actions were consensual, but the aftermath shows that the friend felt led on. The author's responsibility lies in recognizing how their actions impacted their friend, even if not with malicious intent. The friend's feelings of being used or not being treated reciprocally could make the author at fault for not considering the emotional consequences. So, while the author didn't lie, the situation's dynamics suggest they might be in the wrong for not maintaining clear boundaries and potentially causing emotional harm.\n"
