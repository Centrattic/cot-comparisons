I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The situation involves a straight/heteroflexible male accepting blowjobs from a gay friend, then things change when he gets a girlfriend, they stop, then restart after a breakup. The friend becomes distant after the author stops the oral sex and reciprocates once but feels bad. The author is confused because others say he's leading the friend on, but he claims it was clear he's straight.\n\nFirst, consent is key here. Both are adults, and initially, there was mutual agreement. But the dynamics change when the author has a girlfriend. Even though they stopped during the relationship, restarting after the breakup complicates things. The author then reciprocates once and stops, which might have left the friend feeling rejected or confused. The friend's reaction\u2014being cold and distant\u2014could be due to feeling used or unappreciated.\n\nThe author argues that he was clear about his sexuality and didn't lead the friend on. However, the friend might have hoped for a deeper emotional connection or reciprocity that the author wasn't willing to provide. The author's actions, while consensual, might have been emotionally exploitative, especially if the friend was in a vulnerable position. The author's apology and attempt to stop might not have been communicated clearly enough to prevent hurt feelings. The key issue is whether the author respected the friend's emotional needs and boundaries, not just physical ones. Since the friend is described as gay, maybe he was looking for more than a one-sided physical arrangement, feeling that his affection wasn't reciprocated. The author's actions could have damaged the friendship by creating unmet expectations. So, while not illegal, the emotional impact suggests the author might be at fault for not managing the friend's expectations better.\n"
