I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a guy who had a friend offering him a blowjob, and they did it a few times. Then when the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, but after the girlfriend dumped him, they started again. Then the author felt bad and tried returning the favor, but realized it wasn't for him and told his friend to stop. Now the friend is being cold, and the author is wondering if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is heteroflexible, which means he's mostly straight but open to some same-sex experiences. The friend is gay, so he's into guys. The author's actions might have led to some confusion or hurt feelings. The key points are communication and boundaries. The author mentioned that it was clear from the start that he's not interested in a romantic relationship, but maybe the friend saw the sexual acts as a form of intimacy that implied more. The author tried to clarify by stopping after trying to reciprocate, which might have been a way to set boundaries, but the friend is still upset.\n\nAnother angle is that the author had a girlfriend while this was happening, but they stopped when the relationship started. However, after the breakup, the author resumed the arrangement. This could be seen as treating the friend as a means for sexual satisfaction without considering the emotional impact. The friend might feel used or that the author wasn't honest about his intentions. Even though the author didn't lead on romantically, the sexual relationship might have created expectations or emotional attachment on the friend's side.\n\nThe author tried to explain his position, but the friend's reaction suggests he's hurt. The author is now conflicted because they were best friends before. The question is whether the author's actions crossed a line. Since both are 18, they are adults, so consent is part of it. However, the issue is about mutual respect and understanding. The author may have been clear initially, but the ongoing sexual relationship without clear boundaries could have led to the friend feeling rejected or unappreciated when the author tried to reciprocate and then stopped. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the author might be at fault for not managing the friend's expectations better. Even if the author is straight, the friend might have developed feelings or felt that the sexual acts were a form of connection. The author's decision to stop after reciprocating might have been a shock to the friend, leading to the cold treatment. The author also needs to consider if his actions, while consensual, still caused harm. \n\nThe advice from others was to leave him alone, which the author is struggling with. It's possible that the friend needs space, and the author should respect that. If the author keeps pushing to reconnect without addressing the hurt, it might not resolve the issue. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't fully consider the emotional implications on his friend, even if he tried to be clear. The sexual arrangement without mutual understanding of boundaries could have led to the friend feeling used or unappreciated. The author's actions, while consensual, caused harm, making him at fault.\n"
