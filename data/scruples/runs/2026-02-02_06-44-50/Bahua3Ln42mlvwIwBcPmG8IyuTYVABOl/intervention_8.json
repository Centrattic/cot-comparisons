I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a straight guy who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then stopped after getting a girlfriend and later broke up. When they tried to resume, the author felt bad and stopped, leading to the friend becoming distant. The author is confused because they think the friend is now being cold, and others say it's their fault for leading him on, even though the author claims they were clear about being straight.\n\nFirst, consent and communication are key here. The author and friend had an arrangement where the friend was providing oral sex. When the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, which is good. Then, after the breakup, they resumed the activity. The author later reversed the role and felt awful, so they told the friend they should stop. The friend's reaction is now coldness, and the author is upset about losing a close friendship.\n\nBut wait, the author is straight, and the friend is gay. The author never reciprocated the friend's feelings, which might lead to emotional issues. Even if the friend was okay with the initial arrangement, when the author started reciprocating, it might have created mixed signals. The friend could feel used or that the author was taking advantage of their affection. The author's sudden change in behavior after reciprocating might have hurt the friend's feelings, leading to the cold response.\n\nAlso, maintaining a sexual favor without mutual emotional reciprocity can be problematic. The author might have been clear about not wanting a romantic relationship, but the ongoing sexual activity might have created an unbalanced dynamic. When the author stopped, it could have made the friend feel rejected or devalued, especially if he was emotionally invested.\n\nThe author's decision to reciprocate once and then stop might have been confusing. Even if they felt bad, the act itself might have given the friend hope for more, which the author then denied. The friend's distance is a reaction to that inconsistency. The author's friends in the sub said it's their fault for leading on, which makes sense if the friend felt manipulated or used despite the author's initial clarity.\n\nSo, even though the author didn't intend to lead on, the ongoing dynamic and the reversal of roles might have created a situation where the friend felt hurt. The author needs to consider the friend's perspective and whether their actions, despite being consensual at the time, caused emotional harm. The key issue is whether the author respected the friend's emotional needs and whether the arrangement was truly mutual without exploitation. The answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because they contributed to the friend's emotional distress, even if unintentionally.\n"
