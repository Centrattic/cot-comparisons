I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. \n\nFirst, the author is straight but hetflexible, and a gay friend offered a blowjob. He accepted, and this went on for weeks/months. Then he got a girlfriend, and they stopped. After the girlfriend dumped him, they resumed. He later tried to reciprocate but felt uncomfortable and ended it. Now the friend is cold and distant, leading the author to question if he's at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and expectations. Both are 18, so legally adults. The initial arrangement was consensual. The friend is gay, so he's interested in men. The author is straight but open to some activities. However, the author later felt that the friend was doing something he wasn't comfortable with, so he tried reciprocal and then stopped. \n\nThe friend is now upset, but the author argues he didn't lead him on. Others say it's his fault for leading the friend on. The author is confused because he thought it was clear he wasn't interested romantically, just sexually. \n\nBut where's the line? The friend might have hoped for more emotional connection or reciprocal sexual activity, which the author didn't provide. The author reciprocated once but felt awful and stopped, which might have left the friend feeling rejected or confused. \n\nEven if the arrangement was clear, the friend might have had unmet expectations. The author's actions (accepting the blowjobs but not reciprocating emotionally) could be seen as using the friend, which is emotionally manipulative. The friend's reaction (being cold) shows he felt hurt, possibly due to unspoken expectations. \n\nThe author might not have intended to hurt, but the friend's perspective is valid. The author's decision to stop without considering the friend's feelings could be the issue. So, even if there was consent, the friendship's dynamics matter. The author might be in the wrong for not considering the friend's feelings beyond physical acts, leading to a breakdown in the relationship.\n"
