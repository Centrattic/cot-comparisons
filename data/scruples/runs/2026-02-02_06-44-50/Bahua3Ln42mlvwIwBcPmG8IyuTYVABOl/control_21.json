I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong here. The situation involves a straight, heteroflexible male who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend. They started when he was single and then stopped when he got a girlfriend. After the breakup, they resumed, but then the author felt bad and stopped, leading to the friend becoming distant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is clear from the start that he's straight and not interested in a romantic relationship. The friend is gay, so he's attracted to men. The initial agreement was mutual, but when the author's feelings changed, he ended it. The friend is now acting cold. \n\nThe key points are consent and communication. Both parties agreed to the arrangement initially. The author later felt uncomfortable and ended it, which is his right. However, the friend might have felt rejected or emotionally invested beyond just the physical aspect. Even though the author didn't lead him on romantically, the friend might have developed emotional attachment. The author's sudden withdrawal could have hurt his feelings. \n\nAlso, the friend's reaction is being distant and not responding well. The author is trying to reconnect, but the friend is avoiding. The people in the sub said it's the author's fault for leading on, but the author insists it was clear he's straight. The challenge here is whether the author's actions, though consensual, caused harm. \n\nIn terms of ethics, if both parties consented and there was no deception, the author isn't necessarily wrong. However, ending a mutual arrangement can be hurtful, especially if the other person was emotionally involved. The author's responsibility is to communicate his boundaries clearly, which he did. The friend's emotional response is valid, but that doesn't make the author at fault. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. However, it's possible he needs to manage the friendship better, but the core action of stopping the arrangement isn't unethical. The blame isn't on him for the friend's reaction.\n"
