I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the author is a straight, heteroflexible male. He had a close friend who's gay and offered him a blowjob. At the time, he was single and took him up on the offer. They continued this for a while, then stopped when the author got a girlfriend. After the breakup, they resumed the activity, but the author later felt uneasy and reciprocated, which made him uncomfortable. He then asked to stop. Now, the friend is distant, and the author is feeling confused and upset.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. Both parties were adults of age (18), so legally, there's no issue there. The author had a clear understanding from the start that they weren't in a romantic relationship and that he was straight. The friend initiated the arrangement, and the author didn't push for more than what was offered. When the author decided to stop, he communicated it politely, which is important. However, the friend's reaction is causing conflict.\n\nThe user's friends and others suggested the author is at fault for leading the friend on, but the author claims he wasn't. The problem might be that the friend developed emotional attachment or felt rejected when the author stopped reciprocating. The author might not have considered the friend's feelings beyond the physical aspect, but he did try to reach out and explain his actions. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? He didn't force the friend to engage in the activity; the friend offered. The author also stopped the behavior when he felt uncomfortable. However, the sudden change in behavior and the friend's feelings of rejection could be seen as the author not being considerate of the friend's emotions, even if the initial arrangement was mutual. The author might not have realized the emotional implications of his actions, leading to the friend's current coldness. \n\nBut considering the details, the author acted within his boundaries and communicated his limits. The responsibility isn't entirely his. The friend's reaction is more about his own feelings of rejection or unrequited affection, which the author might not have anticipated. So, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong, but there's room for empathy and understanding both sides.\n"
