I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a straight-identifying person, had a gay friend who offered Blowjob services. They engaged in this for a while, then when the author got a girlfriend, they stopped. After the breakup, they resumed, then the author felt bad and reciprocated, but then decided to stop again. Now the friend is being cold, and the author is confused if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend is gay, so he's interested in men, and the author is straight/heteroflexible. The author might not have realized that the friend's actions were based on attraction, but since the author is straight, there's a power imbalance here. The friend might have been in a position where he was providing something the author wanted, possibly out of a desire for connection or affection, but the author didn't reciprocate those feelings beyond physical needs.\n\nWhen the author reciprocated, he felt awful and ended the arrangement. However, the friend is now upset and distant. The author argues that they were clear they were straight and never had romantic intentions. But the issue might be that the friend felt emotionally invested or used, especially after the author started reciprocating. Even if there was no romantic intent, the friend might have felt that the author was taking advantage of his affection for his own pleasure without considering his feelings.\n\nAlso, when the author resumed the activity after breaking up with the girlfriend, that might have been a red flag for the friend, thinking there was a chance for more, which the author then shut down. The friend feeling led on is plausible, even if the author didn't have romantic intentions. The author might have given mixed signals, leading the friend to hope for a deeper connection.\n\nEthically, using someone's affection for personal gratification without considering their emotional needs can be problematic. The author might have not communicated their boundaries clearly from the start, leading to misunderstandings. Even if the author thought it was clear, the friend's actions (like being upset after reciprocation) suggest that he might have had unmet emotional needs or expectations.\n\nAdditionally, the age factor is 18, so both are young and might not have fully developed emotional maturity. But that doesn't excuse not considering the friend's perspective. The author's actions, while not necessarily malicious, could have been careless about the friend's feelings, leading to the rift.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the friend's emotional state and may have contributed to a situation where the friend felt used or unappreciated. The key points are the power imbalance, lack of clear communication of boundaries, and the impact on the friend's feelings. Therefore, the answer seems to be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
