Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a national athlete, trained extensively, and it's a significant part of his identity. The girlfriend, who plays volleyball, said trampolining isn't a real sport and that if he had played a real sport like soccer, he wouldn't be as good. The author took this as an attack on his identity and broke up immediately. The girlfriend's friends think he's being an asshole over something small.\n\nNow, considering the factors. The author's sport is a big part of his life, and the girlfriend didn't respect that. But was breaking up immediately over a single comment justified? On one hand, the comment was hurtful and dismissed his dedication. On the other hand, relationships require communication and understanding. Maybe he should have discussed his feelings instead of reacting so quickly. However, if the comment was a dealbreaker because it touched on his core identity, then maybe it's understandable. But is a breakup over such a situation too harsh?\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's perspective: she might not have intended to be malicious. She could have been making a joke or not realizing the depth of his feelings about the sport. If the author had expressed how important his sport was to him earlier, maybe she wouldn't have made that comment. The fact that her friends think he's an asshole suggests that others see it as overreacting.\n\nBut the author's emotional reaction is valid. His sport is a significant part of his identity. If someone belittles that, it's a personal attack. However, the severity of the punishment (breaking up) depends on whether it was a one-time comment or a pattern of disrespect. If it was a one-time incident, maybe the author overreacted. If it's part of a larger issue of her not respecting his past, then it's more serious.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the action was proportionate. Breaking up over a single comment, even if hurtful, might be seen as disproportionate unless there were prior issues. The author didn't mention previous tensions, so the breakup seems impulsive. However, if the comment struck a nerve and he felt it was a dealbreaker, others might agree with his decision.\n\nBalancing both sides: the author's feelings are valid, but the immediate breakup without discussion might be seen as hasty. The girlfriend's friends' reactions support that. However, the emotional impact of the comment on his identity is significant. It's a tough call. In some cases, people consider the intent and the context. If the girlfriend's comment was a one-off and not malicious, the author might be in the wrong for overreacting. But if the comment was a clear dismissal of his achievements, then it's understandable.\n\nI think the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because breaking up over a single comment, even if hurtful, is extreme unless there's a history of disrespect. However, others might agree with him if the comment was a dealbreaker. Since the community often weighs in on these, maybe it's a mix. But given the options, I need to choose A or B. Considering the girlfriend's friends called him an asshole for something small, and the comment was isolated, the author might be in the wrong. So, Answer: A.\n"
