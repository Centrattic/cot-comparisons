Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her comments about trampolining not being a real sport. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author dedicated a lot of time and effort to trampolining, which is a big part of his identity. When his girlfriend dismissed it as not a real sport and even implied he wouldn't have been as good at a more popular sport, that probably felt like a personal attack. The author's reaction was immediate\u2014dumping her on the spot. But was that justified?\n\nOn the other hand, relationships require communication and mutual respect. Maybe the girlfriend didn't realize how important this issue was to him. She made a joke or a comment that was meant to be light-hearted, but it hit a nerve. The friends said the author was an asshole for breaking up over something small. That suggests that others don't see the comment as a deal-breaker.\n\nBut then again, if someone's core identity is being attacked, that's a big deal. The author's reaction might be an overreaction, but it's also about how the comment made him feel. The question is whether the comment was a legitimate reason to end the relationship. \n\nI think the key here is whether the girlfriend intended to be hurtful. If she didn't realize the significance of trampolining to him, maybe the author should have addressed it calmly instead of breaking up immediately. However, the comment did touch on his self-worth and dedication, which is a serious issue. \n\nSo, is it AITA? The author might have overreacted, but the emotional impact is real. It's a tough call. Some might say the author is in the wrong for overreacting, while others might see it as defending his identity. Considering that the comment was a one-time joke and not a pattern, the author's reaction seems harsh. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong).\n"
