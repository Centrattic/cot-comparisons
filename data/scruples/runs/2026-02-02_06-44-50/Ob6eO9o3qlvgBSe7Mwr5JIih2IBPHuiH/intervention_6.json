Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she called his sport, trampolining, not a real sport. \n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author has dedicated 12 years to trampolining, competing nationally and internationally, and even got funding. That's a significant commitment. To him, the sport is a huge part of his identity. When his girlfriend dismisses it as not a real sport and says there aren't many people doing it, he takes it personally and dumps her.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that she made a joke or a comment, maybe in a discussion about sports. She might not have intended to be hurtful. She plays volleyball, which she considers a real sport. Her friends say the author is an asshole for breaking up over something small. \n\nBut the key point here is whether the comment was a deal-breaker. The author felt attacked in his identity and worth. He might have been hurt because the comment minimized his years of dedication. On the other hand, the girlfriend might not have realized how much it meant to him. She might have made a light-hearted comment without understanding the depth of his feelings.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. Breaking up over a single comment can seem harsh. However, if the comment struck a nerve and was a fundamental disrespect for his identity, maybe it's understandable. The girlfriend's friends also think the author is too harsh, which suggests that the community might not support his reaction. \n\nBut the author's reaction was immediate and final. Maybe he could have addressed it with a conversation, expressed how he felt, and seen if she could apologize. Dumping her on the spot might be an overreaction. However, if this was the culmination of other issues or if the comment was the final straw, it's different. The story doesn't mention prior issues, though. \n\nIn terms of respect in a relationship, both parties should value each other's passions. The girlfriend's comment could be seen as dismissive, but maybe she didn't mean it that way. The author's reaction might be justified if he felt his identity was being attacked, but the sudden breakup without discussion might be the problem. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the girlfriend's comment was a one-time joke and he didn't give her a chance to explain or apologize, then maybe he overreacted. However, if the comment was a deep wound to his self-worth, his reaction might be understandable. The question is whether breaking up was the right response. \n\nI think the answer could go either way. The author's dedication is valid, but ending the relationship without dialogue is extreme. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not addressing the issue more constructively. Alternatively, if the comment was a deal-breaker for him, maybe not. But generally, relationships require communication, so AITA often sides with the person who could have handled it better. \n\nSo, leaning towards the author being in the wrong (A), but I'm a bit torn. The girlfriend's friends think he's an asshole, and the situation was a single comment leading to a breakup without discussion. So maybe the answer is A.\n"
