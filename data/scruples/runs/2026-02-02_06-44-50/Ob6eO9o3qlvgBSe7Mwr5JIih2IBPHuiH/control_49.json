Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her comments about trampolining not being a real sport.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a national athlete, and it's a big part of his identity. His girlfriend made a dismissive comment about trampolining, saying it's not a real sport and that he wouldn't be good at a \"real\" sport like soccer. He took it really personally and broke up immediately. The girlfriend's friends say he's an asshole for overreacting.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the value of the sport, the emotional impact of the comment, and whether breaking up was a reasonable response. Trampolining is an Olympic sport, so it's recognized as a real sport. The girlfriend's comment might have been dismissive and invalidating. The author's reaction was immediate and severe, which could be seen as overreacting, but if the comment attacked his identity and years of dedication, maybe it's understandable.\n\nThe girlfriend's friends think it's too small a reason, but the author felt it was a betrayal of his identity. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. In terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. However, relationships require mutual respect. If she disrespected a core part of his identity, breaking up might be justified. But if the comment was a one-time joke and not meant to attack, maybe the author overreacted. The context includes her background in volleyball, so maybe she didn't realize the depth of his commitment.\n\nThe answer could depend on whether the comment was malicious or not. The girlfriend's statement seems dismissive, and the author's reaction is about defending his identity. In such cases, it's a judgment call, but the AITA format often looks for whether the action was justified. Since the sport is real and her comment was disrespectful, the author might not be in the wrong. But breaking up immediately is drastic. However, it's his right to leave if he felt disrespected. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But some might say A because breaking up over that is too harsh. It's a tricky one.\n"
