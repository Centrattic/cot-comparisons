Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up his girlfriend because she called trampolining not a real sport.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy spent 12 years training intensely in trampolining, representing Canada, and it's a significant part of his identity. His girlfriend made a dismissive comment about his sport, saying it's not a real sport and implying that if he had done a more popular sport like soccer, he wouldn't have been as good. He took it as a personal attack and broke up with her on the spot. Her friends think he was harsh over a small thing.\n\nSo, the key points here. The boyfriend's dedication to his sport is huge. It's not just a hobby; it's a major part of his life and achievements. The girlfriend's comment might seem trivial to some, but it could be deeply hurtful if it's attacking his identity and accomplishments. \n\nBut wait, is the girlfriend's comment really that bad? She did say trampolining isn't a real sport, which is subjective. Some people might not see it as a real sport, but for someone who's invested so much, it's a valid feeling. The girlfriend might not have realized how much this means to him. Maybe she was being dismissive without understanding the effort involved. \n\nOn the other hand, breaking up over that specific comment might be extreme. The girlfriend's friends think it's a small issue. However, if it's a core part of his identity, then maybe it's a big deal. Relationships require mutual respect, and if one partner undermines the other's significant achievements, that's a problem. \n\nBut is the girlfriend's remark a deal-breaker? It's a matter of perspective. The boyfriend might have felt disrespected and that his hard work was trivialized. The girlfriend might not have intended it that way. But the boyfriend's reaction is immediate and severe. However, considering the emotional impact, maybe it's justified. \n\nAlternatively, the girlfriend could have apologized or clarified her comment. But the boyfriend didn't give her a chance to explain. He took it very personally and acted immediately. So maybe he overreacted. But again, if it's about respect for his identity, it's a valid reason. \n\nHmm. The answer hinges on whether the girlfriend's comment was a legitimate disrespect of his achievements and identity, making the breakup justified, or if it was an overreaction to a minor issue. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because he's standing up for his identity and the respect he deserves. His reaction might seem harsh, but the underlying issue is about valuing his dedication. The girlfriend's friends might not understand how big of a deal it is, but to him, it's a core part of who he is. So maybe he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
