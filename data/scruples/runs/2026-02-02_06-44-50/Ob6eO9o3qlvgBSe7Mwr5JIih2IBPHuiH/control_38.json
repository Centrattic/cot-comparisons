Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a national athlete, and had funding. It's a big part of his identity. The girlfriend said trampolining isn't a real sport and implied it's easier than real sports like soccer. The author felt attacked and dumped her on the spot. Friends think he's an asshole for overreacting.\n\nNow, evaluating whether he's at fault. Breaking up over a single comment seems extreme. But the comment was about his identity and achievements. However, the relationship is more important than the incident. Did he give her a chance to apologize or explain? He immediately ended it. Maybe she didn't understand the significance of her words. Also, trampolining is a recognized sport, so her comment might be ignorant rather than malicious. But the author's reaction might be justified if it's a core part of his self-worth. However, relationships require communication and understanding. Ending the relationship without discussion could be seen as impulsive. But the comment did target his identity, which is a big deal. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girlfriend's comment was hurtful and dismissive. But the author's response was immediate breakup. So, is he in the wrong? It's a tough call. Some might say he overreacted, others might see her comment as disrespectful. The friends think he's in the wrong, but the author felt his identity was attacked. There's no clear right answer, but generally, breaking up over one comment without dialogue could be seen as his fault unless the comment was extremely offensive. Since trampolining is a real sport, her statement was incorrect, but not necessarily malicious. So maybe he's not entirely in the wrong. But the immediate breakup without discussion might make him at fault. Hmm. I'm leaning towards A (he's in the wrong) because relationships need more than reacting to one comment. But some might argue B (not in the wrong) if the comment was deeply personal. It's a close call, but I think the author overreacted.\n"
