Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her comments about his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy has put in a lot of time and dedication into trampolining, competing at national and international levels. His injury forced him to quit, but it was a huge part of his identity. The girlfriend, on the other hand, made comments downplaying the sport, saying it's not a real sport and implying it's easier than others like soccer. He felt attacked and dumped her, but her friends and others think he overreacted. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, key points here: The man's deep commitment and pride in his sport versus the girlfriend's dismissive remarks. The breakup was immediate after the conversation. The girlfriend's friends think it's a small issue to break up over. The author argues his validity, the girlfriend's friends argue he's an asshole. \n\nNow, I need to assess if his reaction was justified. Factors to consider: the significance of the sport to his identity, the nature of her comments, and the appropriateness of ending the relationship over this.\n\nTrampolining is indeed a recognized Olympic sport (since 2000), so calling it \"not a real sport\" is factually incorrect. Her comment about others not getting to a high level might be a stretch, but the key here is the emotional impact. The man felt his identity was attacked. While her comments were disrespectful, breaking up might be a strong reaction unless there's a history of similar issues.\n\nHowever, communication is crucial in relationships. The girlfriend's friends might not see it as a big deal, but for the man, it's a core part of who he is. If this was an isolated incident and he felt it was a deal-breaker, maybe he's not wrong. But if this is an overreaction without prior context, then maybe he is. \n\nBut the scenario states that this was a one-time conversation where she made a comment he found deeply hurtful. If he felt this was a fundamental disrespect that he couldn't overlook, then breaking up might be his right. However, others might argue that a single comment shouldn't end a relationship. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's own athletic background (volleyball) might be relevant. She might not have intended to belittle his sport but was comparing her own experience. However, the way she phrased it was dismissive. \n\nIn AITA cases, the community often looks at intent and impact. Even if the comment wasn't meant to be malicious, the impact was significant. But breaking up over a single conversation might be seen as too drastic. \n\nOn the other hand, if this was a core value for him and a deal-breaker, then it's his choice. The answer hinges on whether the reaction is proportionate. \n\nI think the community would lean towards the man being in the right because his dedication was genuine, and her comments were disrespectful. However, some might say that breaking up over a single conversation is too harsh. But given the depth of his investment in the sport, it's understandable. \n\nSo, the answer here is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But I need to make sure. Maybe the girlfriend's friends are right if they think it's a small issue. But for the author, it's a big deal. In AITA, the community often sides with the person who felt their core values were violated, especially if the other party's actions were clearly disrespectful, even if unintended.\n"
