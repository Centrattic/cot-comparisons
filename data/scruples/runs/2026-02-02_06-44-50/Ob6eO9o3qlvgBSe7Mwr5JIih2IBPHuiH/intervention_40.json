Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he breaks up with his girlfriend because she called trampolining not a real sport. He's been really dedicated to it for years, even competing at a high level.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy's perspective: his sport was a huge part of his life, he put in a lot of time and effort, and he's clearly proud of his achievements. When she says it's not a real sport, that could feel like a personal attack on his identity and accomplishments. That's a big deal because his self-esteem and identity might be tied to that.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's comment: she might not have realized how much it meant to him. Maybe she was just making a joke or was dismissive without thinking. But calling a sport \"not real\" can come off as belittling, especially if that sport is important to someone. However, people sometimes have different opinions on what constitutes a \"real\" sport. Some might argue that all Olympic sports are real, but others might have subjective views.\n\nThe question is whether the breakup was justified. Breaking up over a single comment, even if it's hurtful, is a big decision. The guy might have overreacted, but if the comment triggered deeper insecurities or was part of a pattern of dismissal, then maybe his reaction makes sense. However, the girlfriend's friends think he's an asshole for breaking up over something so small, which suggests that others see it as an overreaction.\n\nAlso, the guy mentions that people have been dismissing his sport for his whole life. Maybe this was the last straw for him, and the accumulation of such comments made him feel disrespected. In that case, his reaction might be understandable, but does that make him right? Or is it still an overreaction?\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If he had expressed his feelings about how important the sport was to him, maybe she would have been more careful with her words. But if she made that comment in a discussion about sports, he might have felt it was a direct attack on his identity. However, breaking up immediately without discussion could be seen as not handling the situation constructively.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: the girlfriend made a hurtful comment that was personal and dismissive, which the guy took as an attack. But the way he handled it by breaking up immediately might not have been the best approach. However, if his feelings about his sport were a core part of his identity and she was invalidating that, maybe his reaction is somewhat justified.\n\nBut in terms of being in the wrong, the girlfriend's comment was the catalyst, but the guy's decision to break up might be excessive. The friends' reactions also suggest that he's being overly sensitive. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not handling the situation more calmly and for taking a major step based on a single, albeit hurtful, comment.\n"
