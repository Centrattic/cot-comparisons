Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her making fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, trained extensively, competed nationally and internationally, and even received funding. This is a significant part of his identity. When his girlfriend dismisses trampolining as not a \"real sport,\" comparing it to something like soccer, it's a direct attack on his passion and dedication. \n\nThe girlfriend's comments imply that his achievements aren't as valid because the sport isn't as popular or hard as others. This could be hurtful, especially since the author values his accomplishments. The question is whether the breakup was justified. \n\nOn one hand, reacting to a single comment with a breakup might seem extreme. Some might argue that the girlfriend's opinion, while hurtful, doesn't warrant ending the relationship. Friends' opinions that he's an \"asshole\" for overreacting support this view. However, others might see it as a valid response to a personal attack on his identity and work.\n\nThe key here is the emotional impact. The author felt that his core identity was being attacked. If someone's values or passions are central to their self-worth, a partner discrediting those can be a major issue. The girlfriend's dismissal might indicate a lack of respect for his achievements and identity, which is a serious concern in a relationship.\n\nHowever, the reaction's immediacy and the friends' judgment are also factors. While the comment was hurtful, breaking up on the spot without further discussion might not allow for resolving misunderstandings. Yet, given the depth of the author's feelings and the personal significance of the sport, the reaction, while intense, isn't without merit.\n\nSo, considering the emotional weight and the importance of mutual respect in a relationship, the author might not be in the wrong. The girlfriend's comments were disrespectful towards a significant part of his identity, and the breakup could be seen as a reaction to this disrespect rather than an overreaction to a minor issue. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No).\n"
