Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he dumped his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining. He was a national-level athlete, trained 30 hours a week, got funding, and then got a head injury. She said trampolining isn't a real sport and that it's not hard to get good at it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if his reaction was proportionate. He's clearly passionate about trampolining; it's a big part of his identity. She made a comment that could be seen as dismissive or disrespectful. But is that enough to dump someone over? People have different opinions on what's a \"real\" sport. Some might argue that trampolining is indeed a legitimate sport, especially since it's Olympic and has national teams. Others might not take it as seriously, but that's subjective.\n\nThe key points here: Did she cross a line by devaluing his achievements? He felt attacked, which is valid because his sport was a major part of his life. However, breaking up immediately might be an overreaction. Maybe he should have discussed his feelings first instead of ending the relationship right away. On the other hand, if respecting his accomplishments was a deal-breaker for her, then the breakup makes sense. But the friends think he's an asshole, which complicates things. \n\nI need to weigh the importance of mutual respect in a relationship. If someone undermines your passions, that's a red flag. But the way he handled it (dumping her immediately) might not be the healthiest approach. Maybe he should have talked it out first. However, her friends' opinions don't necessarily determine right or wrong. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the comment was a one-time thing and he reacted too harshly, then yes. But if he felt disrespected in a way that's a deal-breaker, then no. The line between being hurt and being wrong is thin here. The fact that she dismissed his dedication, which he values highly, might justify his reaction. But the immediacy of the breakup without discussion could be seen as impulsive. \n\nI think it's a bit of both, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the issue was about respect for his identity. But maybe he could have handled it better. However, given the context, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the answer is A or B, based on the situation described, the author's reaction, while strong, might be justified if her comment was a fundamental disrespect to his values. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But others might think A. Hmm.\n"
