Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she mocked his sport, trampolining. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the guy has been dedicated to trampolining for 12 years, competing at national and international levels. It's a significant part of his identity. He's received funding, trained extensively, and had to quit due to injury. Now, he's with his girlfriend who he met after he stopped competing. She plays volleyball, which he thought was cool. \n\nDuring a conversation about sports, she says trampolining isn't a real sport, implies it's not as hard as soccer, and suggests he wouldn't have been good at a \"real\" sport. He takes it really personally, dumps her, and now people are saying he's an ass for breaking up over something small. \n\nHmm. So, why would he think it's a deal-breaker? To him, trampolining is a huge part of his identity. Her comments might feel like an attack on his dedication and achievements. She minimized his effort by comparing it to other sports, which can come off as dismissive. \n\nBut on the other hand, some might argue that taking offense to someone's opinion about a sport is overreacting. Maybe she didn't mean to attack him personally, just made a flippant comment. Also, if they were in a healthy relationship, maybe this is a sign of deeper issues, like respect for each other's passions. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Breaking up over a single comment seems extreme to some. But if her comment hurt his self-worth and showed a lack of respect for his hard work, maybe it's a justified decision. It's tricky because relationships require mutual respect. If she couldn't respect his achievements, that's a red flag. However, maybe the way he reacted was too hasty. \n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend's friends called him an asshole. They might think it's not a big deal. But the guy's perspective is that his identity was under attack. So, it's about how much weight to give her comment versus his feelings. \n\nIn the end, whether he's in the wrong depends on whether the reaction is disproportionate. If the breakup was immediate and based on a single conversation, maybe he overreacted. But if her comment was a culmination of previous disrespect, it's different. Since the scenario only mentions this one incident, perhaps the breakup is seen as impulsive. However, if respecting each other's passions is fundamental, then maybe not. \n\nI think the answer hinges on the balance between respecting personal achievements and the appropriateness of the reaction. Since the comment was dismissive and he felt it attacked his identity, some might side with him. Others might say it's a small issue to break up over. But considering the emotional impact and the significance of the sport to him, maybe he's not in the wrong. So, I lean towards answer B (No).\n"
