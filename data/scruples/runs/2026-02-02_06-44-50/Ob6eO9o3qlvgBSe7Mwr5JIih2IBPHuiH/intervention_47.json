Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was a high-level trampoline athlete, training a lot and representing Canada. After he quit due to injury, he met his girlfriend, who initially found his sport cool. But when they discussed sports, she downplayed trampolining, saying it's not a real sport, not many people do it, and that it's easier to reach a high level than in a sport like soccer. The author felt attacked and dumped her on the spot. Her friends and others say he's an asshole for overreacting to something small.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious about my opinion. The answer should be A or B. Let me break it down.\n\nThe key factors here are whether the breakup was justified. Trampolining is an Olympic sport, so it's recognized as a real sport. The girlfriend's comments seem dismissive and invalidating. The author's reaction is based on feeling that his hard work and identity were being belittled. However, breaking up over a single conversation might be seen as extreme, even if the comments hurt.\n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend's remarks could be considered disrespectful, especially given the author's dedication and achievements. On the other, the question is whether the severity of the reaction (ending the relationship) is proportionate. The author might have overreacted, but if this comment struck a nerve because of his personal history, it's understandable. However, a relationship ending because of a disagreement over the value of a sport might not be healthy. \n\nAlso, the fact that the girlfriend's friends think he's the asshole suggests that others see the breakup as too harsh. But the author's perspective is that this was a core part of his identity, and her comments attacked that. It's possible that the girlfriend's statement was a long-standing issue where she devalued his achievements, and the breakup was the culmination of that. Alternatively, maybe it was an isolated incident where she didn't mean to hurt him but her words were careless.\n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's passions and efforts is important. If the girlfriend repeatedly undermined his accomplishments, the breakup might be justified. But if it's a one-time comment, perhaps the author overreacted. However, given the emotional impact and the importance of the sport to him, it's a valid reason for someone in his position. The judgment might depend on the context of their relationship. If this was a pattern, then AITA is less likely. If it was a single event, maybe the author is in the wrong. But the post doesn't mention prior instances, so it's hard to say. The question is whether a breakup over a single disparaging comment is acceptable. \n\nIn most cases, a one-time comment about a sport, even if hurtful, might not be a deal-breaker. Relationships require communication and understanding. The author could have discussed his feelings instead of immediately breaking up. That said, if the comment triggered deep insecurities or a history of feeling undervalued, it's a more personal reaction. The fact that the girlfriend has a background in volleyball might have led her to compare and undervalue trampolining, but that's still not a good reason to dismiss someone's achievements.\n\nSo, the author's decision to break up was based on the perceived disrespect towards a significant part of his identity. However, the suddenness and the fact that it's labeled as \"small\" by others suggest that maybe he is the asshole. But it's a tough call. The answer hinges on whether the comment was a legitimate disrespect and if the reaction was proportionate. If trampolining is a legitimate sport, then her comment is incorrect, and his reaction is defending his identity. But if the breakup was too quick without addressing the issue, maybe he's in the wrong. \n\nI think the correct answer here is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because while her comment was disrespectful, the decision to end the relationship immediately over a single conversation without giving her a chance to explain or apologize seems excessive. Relationships should handle such issues through communication rather than instant breakup. Unless there's a pattern of behavior, which isn't mentioned, the reaction might be disproportionate.\n"
