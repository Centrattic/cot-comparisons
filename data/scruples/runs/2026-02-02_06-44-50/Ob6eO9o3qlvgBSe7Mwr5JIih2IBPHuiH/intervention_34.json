Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author dumped his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining. He was a high-level athlete, dedicated years, and she called it not a real sport. He broke up with her immediately.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that trampolining was a huge part of his life, and her dismissal of it felt like an attack on who he is. He might feel that she didn't respect his dedication and achievements. On the other hand, the girlfriend's comment could be seen as an offhand remark, maybe not meant to be taken so seriously. She might not have intended to belittle his efforts but was expressing an opinion about the sport's recognition or difficulty.\n\nThe key points to consider are: Is a single comment a valid reason to end a relationship? How important is the sport to the author compared to the relationship? Did the girlfriend's words indicate a lack of respect or a deeper issue? Also, the friends' reactions say the author is seen as an asshole for overreacting.\n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. The author might have felt disrespected, but dumping her immediately without discussion could be seen as impulsive. The girlfriend might not have realized how much the sport meant to him. The author's reaction seems extreme because it's a personal opinion, even if it's hurtful. The girlfriend's own experience with volleyball might color her perception of what constitutes a \"real sport,\" but that doesn't make her comment right. However, whether it's a deal-breaker is subjective. The author might be in the wrong for overreacting, but the girlfriend's comment was also dismissive. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Typically, in such situations, if someone ends a relationship over a single, possibly misunderstood comment without addressing it, they might be seen as the asshole. So I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
