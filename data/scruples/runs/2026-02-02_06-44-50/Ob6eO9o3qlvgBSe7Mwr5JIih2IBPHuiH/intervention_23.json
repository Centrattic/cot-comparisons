Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she mocked his sport, trampolining. The key points here are the context of their relationship, the nature of the argument, and the appropriateness of the breakup.\n\nFirst, the author has dedicated a significant amount of time and effort to trampolining, which was a major part of his identity. The girlfriend made a dismissive comment, calling trampolining a \"real sport,\" implying it's not as valid as others like soccer. The author felt this was an attack on his life's work and ended the relationship immediately.\n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's perspective, she might not have realized the depth of his feelings about the sport. She mentioned her own experience with volleyball and perhaps thought she was sharing a personal reflection. However, her comment did come off as dismissive, which could be seen as insensitive.\n\nThe question is whether breaking up over this was justified. While the comment was hurtful, is it a deal-breaker? The friends of the girlfriend think the author overreacted. On the other hand, the author feels his core identity was disrespected. It's important to assess if this was an isolated incident or a pattern. If the relationship had other issues, maybe the breakup is reasonable, but from the given info, it's unclear. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author could have addressed his feelings instead of ending things abruptly. Immediate breakup might be seen as extreme, especially if there's no prior history of such issues. However, if the comment revealed deeper incompatibilities, maybe it's a valid decision. \n\nGiven that the girlfriend's friends called the author an asshole, it suggests that her side might have more support. Still, the author's hurt is valid. The line between standing up for oneself and overreacting is thin here. I think the author's reaction was hasty. He could have discussed his feelings to address the issue rather than ending the relationship immediately. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
