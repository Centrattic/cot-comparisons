Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she called trampolining not a real sport. The author has a long history in trampolining, dedicating a lot of time and effort. The girlfriend's comment seems to undermine his dedication, which he took very personally.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that his sport is as legitimate as any other, given his achievements and the competition level. The girlfriend's comment might come off as dismissive, which can be hurtful. But is that enough to justify breaking up? Relationships often involve disagreements, and maybe the severity of the issue here is a point of contention.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have made a throwaway comment without realizing how much it would hurt him. People sometimes make offhand remarks that they don't mean to be offensive. If the relationship is otherwise healthy, maybe a breakup over a single joke isn't necessary. But if this comment hit a nerve because of past experiences or feelings of not being respected, then the author might have a valid reaction.\n\nThe friends think he's an asshole for breaking up over something small, which suggests that the breakup might be seen as overreacting. However, the author feels that his identity and dedication were attacked. There's a balance between standing up for oneself and overreacting. If the comment was a one-time thing and not part of a pattern, maybe the author's reaction is too harsh. But if the girlfriend has a history of belittling his interests, it could be a bigger issue.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not always black and white. The author's decision to break up is a personal choice, but whether it's justified depends on the context. The key factors here are the intent behind the girlfriend's comment and the author's emotional response. If the comment was meant to be dismissive and the author felt it was a significant disrespect, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if the comment was a minor joke and the breakup was disproportionately harsh, then maybe he is. The friends' opinions suggest that the majority view is that he's being too hard on a small issue. But the author's deep emotional connection to his sport adds nuance. Ultimately, it's about whether the reaction was proportionate. If the breakup was immediate and without discussion, perhaps he could have handled it differently. But the decision to end the relationship is his to make, even if others disagree.\n"
