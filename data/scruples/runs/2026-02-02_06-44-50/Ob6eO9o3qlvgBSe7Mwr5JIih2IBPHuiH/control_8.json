Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend over her making fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. He was a high-level athlete in trampolining, dedicating 12 years and a lot of time, even getting funding. Then he met his girlfriend after he stopped competing. She played volleyball but not at the same level. During a conversation about sports, she dismissed trampolining as not a real sport, suggesting it's less valid than soccer, and he took it as an attack on his identity and dedication, leading him to break up.\n\nThe key points here are about respect, personal identity, and the significance of the sport to him. He felt that her comments invalidated his hard work and achievements. She might have been making a joke or underestimating the sport's difficulty, not realizing how much it meant to him.\n\nNow, considering if he's in the wrong. Breaking up over this could be seen as a strong reaction. But the article mentions that this hurt him because the sport was a huge part of his life. If the girlfriend made a dismissive comment about something he's passionate about, it's reasonable for him to feel attacked. However, others might say that one conversation isn't a big deal and that taking it so seriously is overreacting.\n\nAlso, the friends said he was an asshole, but that might not be the best indicator. The girlfriend's friends might not fully understand the context of his dedication. The question is whether her comment was a legitimate criticism or just a joke. If she was being disrespectful, then his reaction is justified. If she was just teasing and he overreacted, maybe he's in the wrong.\n\nBut the key is the impact on his self-esteem and identity. If she consistently disrespects his achievements, that's a problem. However, a single instance might be a miscommunication. But given the depth of his commitment, it's understandable he felt attacked. So, maybe he's not in the wrong. The answer would be B, No.\n"
