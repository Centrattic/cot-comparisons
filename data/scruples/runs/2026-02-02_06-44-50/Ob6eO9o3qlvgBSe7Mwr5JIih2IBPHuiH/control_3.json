Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that he broke up with his girlfriend because she called trampolining not a real sport. He's been into it for 12 years, was a national athlete, and now she's making a comment that's devaluing his dedication.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The guy's argument is that his sport is real and important to him, and her comment was dismissive of his achievements. The girlfriend's perspective, as relayed, is that trampolining isn't a real sport and that he wouldn't have been good at a \"real\" sport like soccer. \n\nThe key factors here are how significant the issue is. Breaking up over a comment about a sport's validity... that's a big step. But the user might feel that his identity and years of work were being attacked. On the other hand, the girlfriend might not have intended it as a serious attack but as a joke or a casual opinion. \n\nTrampolining is an Olympic sport, so it's recognized. However, perceptions vary about what's considered a \"real\" sport. The girlfriend might not have realized the depth of his feelings about it. But is calling a sport \"not real\" a dealbreaker? It depends on the context of their relationship. If the girlfriend made fun of his achievements, that's disrespectful. However, if the comment was offhand and not meant to attack, maybe the reaction was too harsh.\n\nThe friends said he's an asshole for breaking up over something small. But to him, it's not small because it's tied to his identity. The question is whether her comment was a legitimate issue or a misunderstanding. If she was being dismissive of his accomplishments, then he's justified. If she was just expressing an opinion without malice, then maybe he overreacted.\n\nTrampolining is a legitimate sport with international competitions. The girlfriend's assertion that it's easier to get to a high level might be a misconception. However, the fact that he was among the top 500 globally suggests that it's challenging. So her comment could be seen as undermining his effort.\n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, respect is crucial. If she made a joke or a comment that was disrespectful, he has a right to feel hurt. But breaking up immediately might be a quick reaction. However, given the emotional significance, maybe it's understandable.\n\nThe answer hinges on intent and context. If the girlfriend's comment was meant to belittle his sport, then he's right to be hurt. If it was a passing remark without ill intent, then his reaction might be excessive. But the post describes her as making a direct statement, not a joke. So her friends might not see it as a big deal, but for him, it's a core issue.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the comment was disrespectful and hurtful, then no. If it was minor and he overreacted, then yes. Given his perspective and the validity of his feelings, I think he's not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
