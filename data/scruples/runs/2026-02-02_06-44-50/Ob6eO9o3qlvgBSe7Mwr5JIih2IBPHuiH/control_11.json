Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend over her comments about his sport, trampolining. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The guy has dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a national athlete, trained extensively, and even got funding. His career ended due to injury. He met his girlfriend after retiring, and she was initially interested in his sport. But when they discussed sports, she dismissed trampolining as not a real sport, saying it's not hard to get good at and that he wouldn't be good in a real sport like soccer. He broke up with her right then, and her friends think he's an asshole for overreacting.\n\nThe key points here are about the validity of his reaction. Trampolining is an Olympic sport, so calling it not a real sport is factually incorrect. The woman's comment was not just a joke but a direct dismissal of his dedication and achievements. For someone who invested so much time and effort, this could be a deep personal attack. \n\nBut then, is breaking up over this too much? Some might say that while her comment was hurtful, it's just a difference in opinion. However, the fact that she minimized his hard work and accomplishments, which are a huge part of his identity, might make it a bigger issue. The response of her friends is also telling\u2014they think it's a small matter. But if someone's core identity is attacked, that's not trivial to the person involved. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the guy overreacted. Relationships require tolerance for each other's opinions. But when someone directly undermines a significant part of your identity, that's a serious breach. The woman's statement was not just a joke; it was a judgment of his entire career. \n\nSo, the author's reaction is justified because the comment was a personal attack on his identity and achievements. Therefore, he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
