Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she called trampolining not a real sport. The author dedicated 12 years to it, had national and international competitions, and it was a huge part of his life. The girlfriend made a comment that trampolining isn't a real sport, comparing it to something like soccer, and he immediately dumped her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has a deep emotional connection to his sport, which is understandable. The girlfriend's comment seems dismissive and belittling, which can be hurtful. But is it a deal-breaker? The question is whether the author overreacted.\n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend's statement appears to undermine his dedication and achievements. It's possible she didn't realize the significance of her words, but her comment could be seen as invalidating his hard work. The author might have felt that this was a personal attack, given how much the sport shaped his identity.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the breakup was over a relatively minor issue. The girlfriend might have been making a joke or not fully understanding the nuances of different sports. While her comment was insensitive, does that justify ending the relationship? People have different values and sensitivities. The girlfriend's perspective might be that sports like soccer have more mainstream recognition, but that doesn't make trampolining any less valid as a sport, especially given the author's achievements.\n\nThe friends' reactions also play a role here. They said the author was an asshole for breaking up over something small, which suggests that others think his reaction was excessive. However, the author felt deeply attacked, which is a personal emotional response.\n\nI need to weigh the validity of the author's feelings against the proportionality of the response. It's important to validate that his feelings are real and hurt, but whether the breakup was justified depends on how much that particular issue mattered in the relationship. If this was a one-time comment and not part of a larger pattern of disrespect, some might see it as overreacting. Others might side with the author because the comment struck at his core identity.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks for intent. Did the girlfriend mean to hurt him, or was it an offhand comment? If it was the latter, the author might be in the wrong for not addressing it through communication. However, if the comment was intentional and repeatedly dismissive, the author's reaction is more justified.\n\nSince the situation is presented as a single conversation, without prior issues, the key is whether the girlfriend's statement was a deal-breaker. The author's reaction might be seen as extreme by some, but others might empathize with his hurt feelings. The answer might hinge on the cultural perception of the sport and how much that matters in a relationship. In the end, the decision between A and B depends on whether the comment was a legitimate reason to end the relationship or an overreaction.\n"
