Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author spent 12 years training in trampolining, was at a high national level, even got funding. That's a huge commitment. When she says trampolining isn't a real sport and that it's easy to be good at compared to something like soccer, that's clearly a personal attack on his dedication and achievements. For him, this is about his identity and the value he places on his sport. He felt attacked, which is valid because people often take personal jabs at their passions really hard.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have been joking or not realizing how much it meant to him. She has her own background in volleyball and perhaps sees her sport as more legitimate. But does that justify making fun of his sport? It seems like she dismissed his accomplishments, which could be seen as disrespectful. However, breaking up over a single comment might be a strong reaction. The friends called him an asshole because they might see it as overreacting. But if the comment hit a nerve that's important to his self-identity, maybe it's not just about the comment itself.\n\nI need to consider if the breakup was too hasty. Relationships can't just be ended over every disagreement, but when someone's core identity is being attacked, that's a big deal. The key here is the intent and impact. If she intended to mock and didn't consider his feelings, then the author's reaction could be justified. But if she was just being dismissive without malice, maybe there's room for discussion.\n\nThe author's response was immediate. He didn't try to talk things out or explain the significance of trampolining to him. Jumping straight to a breakup might not be the healthiest approach, but the hurt and feeling disrespected could have made him act impulsively. However, breaking up over one conversation might be seen as overreacting, especially if the comment was an isolated incident and not a pattern of disrespect.\n\nIn the end, while the author's feelings are valid, the action of breaking up immediately without addressing the issue first might be the wrong approach. But if the comment was a deal-breaker because it represented a fundamental disrespect for his achievements, then maybe it's justified. The answer hinges on whether the breakup was a proportionate response to the perceived disrespect.\n"
