Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was a high-level trampoline athlete for 12 years, training 30 hours a week, competing nationally and internationally. After an injury, he quit. He met his girlfriend after that, and she had heard about his achievements, which she initially found cool. She played volleyball in high school. Then, during a conversation, she downplays trampolining, saying it's not a real sport compared to something like soccer, and claims it's easier to reach a high level. The author takes this as an attack on his identity and dumps her immediately. Her friends say he's an asshole for breaking up over something small, but he feels deeply hurt because his sport was a huge part of his life.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. To decide between A and B, I need to consider the context and the perspective of both parties. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, trampolining is a significant part of his identity and achievements. The girlfriend's comments might have felt dismissive and belittling, especially coming after he had shared his pride in his accomplishments. He might feel that she was invalidating his hard work and dedication, which is a big deal. Breaking up over this could be his way of showing that he won't let someone mock a core part of who he is.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's friends think it's too small a reason to break up. Maybe she was joking or not aware of how sensitive it is. She had her own experience with volleyball, which she might value similarly, but her comparison could have been careless. The key here is whether her statement was a genuine insult or just a thoughtless remark. If the author immediately dumps her without discussing, maybe that's overreacting, but if it's a dealbreaker for him, then it's justified.\n\nI should consider if there's a middle ground. Perhaps the author could have addressed her comment with a discussion instead of an immediate breakup. But the situation states that the sport was a huge part of his identity. When someone attacks a core value or a significant life achievement, that can be a dealbreaker, especially if the partner is dismissive and doesn't respect it. The girlfriend's friends might not understand the emotional weight, but the author did. So, the answer might lean towards B, meaning he's not in the wrong. However, I should check if the girlfriend's comment was a one-time thing and if there were other underlying issues. The post doesn't mention prior issues, so it's just this one incident. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the action was proportionate. If the comment was a major personal attack, then it's valid. But if it's a minor issue, maybe not. Here, the girlfriend's statement seems to devalue his hard work and achievements, which is a personal attack. So, the author's reaction, while sudden, might be justified if he feels this was a fundamental disrespect. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
