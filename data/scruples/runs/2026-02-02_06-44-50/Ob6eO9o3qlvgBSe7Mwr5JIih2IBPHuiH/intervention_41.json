Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're at fault for breaking up their girlfriend over her making fun of his sport, trampolining. The key points are the dedication the author had to the sport, the girlfriend's comments, and the reactions from others.\n\nFirst, the author dedicated 12 years, trained extensively, competed nationally and internationally, and even got funding. That's a significant commitment. The girlfriend, who played volleyball in high school, made a comment that trampolining isn't a real sport and implied it's easier than real sports like soccer. The author felt attacked and ended the relationship immediately.\n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's perspective: she might have been joking or not realizing the depth of the author's commitment. However, the comment was dismissive of his achievements. The author felt that the comment undermined his identity and hard work. \n\nThe friends said the author was an asshole for breaking up over something small. But the author's reaction was based on a deep personal value tied to his sport. The question is whether the reaction was disproportionate. \n\nTrampolining is recognized as a sport with Olympic status, so calling it not a real sport is incorrect. The girlfriend's comment shows a lack of understanding or respect for the author's dedication. The author's response was immediate, but was it justified? \n\nIn relationships, respect for each other's passions is important. If one partner mocks the other's significant achievements, that's a red flag. The author might have overreacted, but the comment did attack a core part of his identity. \n\nOn the flip side, maybe the author could have addressed the comment in a less drastic way, like discussing why it hurt instead of breaking up immediately. But given the emotional impact, it's possible the author felt the comment was a dealbreaker. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. They might have handled it differently, but the girlfriend's comment was disrespectful. The friends' reaction might not consider the depth of the issue. The answer could hinge on whether the breakup was a proportional response to the disrespect shown.\n"
