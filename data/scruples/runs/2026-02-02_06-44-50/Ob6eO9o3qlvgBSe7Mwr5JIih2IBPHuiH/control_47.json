Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong after dumping his girlfriend for making fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy has put in a lot of time and dedication into trampolining, which is a national sport for Canada. He's been training hard, competed nationally and internationally, and even got funding. Then, after he stops, he meets his girlfriend. She initially seems interested in his sport. But when they discuss sports, she downplays trampolining, saying it's not a real sport, not many people do it, and that it's easier than real sports like soccer. He reacts by dumping her on the spot. His friends say he was an asshole for breaking up over something small. He's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nNow, to evaluate if he's in the wrong. The key points here are about respect for personal achievements, the value of a sport, and whether the reaction was proportionate.\n\nTrampolining is recognized as a legitimate Olympic sport, so calling it not a real sport is incorrect. The girlfriend's comments come across as dismissive and disrespectful towards his dedication and achievements. The man's reaction was to end the relationship immediately, which some might see as overreacting, but others might see as standing up for himself when his identity and hard work are being attacked.\n\nOn one hand, it's valid for him to feel hurt and disrespected. If someone belittles your passion and years of dedication, that can be a deal-breaker. On the other hand, relationships require communication. Maybe he could have discussed his feelings instead of breaking up immediately. However, the girlfriend's comments were a direct attack on his core identity, which might justify his reaction.\n\nBut the question is about whether he was in the wrong. In arguments like these, people often take sides based on how justified the reaction is. If the comment was a one-time joke and not meant seriously, maybe the breakup is too harsh. But if the comment was a reflection of deeper disrespect or a lack of appreciation for his achievements, then it's a valid reason.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's friends said he was an asshole, implying that breaking up over this was too extreme. However, the man's perspective is that the comment attacked who he is, which is a significant issue. So it's a bit of a toss-up between respecting personal boundaries and the proportionality of the response.\n\nIn similar AITA scenarios, sometimes the person breaking up over a perceived slight is seen as wrong if it's considered overreacting. However, if the issue is about respect for one's identity and achievements, the response might be more justified. The fact that the girlfriend trivialized his sport and achievements could be a deal-breaker for some people. So, there are arguments both ways.\n\nBut in this case, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the reaction was disproportionate. The man's dedication and the significance of the sport in his life are substantial. The girlfriend's comments were disrespectful, so standing up for himself isn't necessarily wrong. However, ending a relationship over a single conversation might be seen as extreme. But given the emotional impact, maybe not. It's a bit of a nuanced call.\n"
