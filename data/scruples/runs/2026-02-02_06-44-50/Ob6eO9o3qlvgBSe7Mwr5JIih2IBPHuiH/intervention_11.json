Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her making fun of his sport, trampolining. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the author has dedicated 12 years to trampolining, reaching a national and international level, even getting funding. That's a significant commitment. The girlfriend, who plays volleyball, made a comment that trampolining isn't a real sport and that it's easier than a real sport like soccer. The author took this as a personal attack and ended the relationship immediately.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the dedication and pride in the sport, and the girlfriend's dismissive comment. The author felt that the comment was an attack on his identity and efforts. On the other hand, the girlfriend might not have intended it that way; maybe she was just making a joke or a casual remark. But the author took it seriously enough to end the relationship.\n\nNow, I need to consider whether the reaction was justified. Breaking up over a single comment, even if it's hurtful, might be seen as overreacting. But the context is that the sport was a huge part of his life. So the comment might have triggered deeper insecurities or feelings of not being respected. However, relationships require communication and understanding. If the girlfriend had made that comment before, and the author had expressed that it was important to him, then maybe the response is justified. But this seems like a one-time incident. The girlfriend's friends also think the author is an asshole, which might indicate that her comment was out of line, but maybe the author overreacted.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend's comparison of trampolining to soccer. Trampolining is a recognized Olympic sport, so it's debatable whether it's not a \"real\" sport. Her statement might reflect a lack of understanding or respect for his achievements. But the author's immediate breakup without discussing it further could be seen as impulsive. Maybe he should have talked it out first instead of ending the relationship abruptly.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I'm not sure. The line between a justified reaction and overreaction can be blurry. The author's years of dedication and the emotional impact of the comment are significant factors. However, breaking up over such a specific issue might not be the healthiest approach. The girlfriend's friends' opinions might not be a good gauge, as they might be biased.\n\nIn conclusion, while the comment was hurtful and dismissive, the immediate breakup without dialogue could be seen as the author's mistake. However, the depth of the issue for the author is valid. It's a tough call, but perhaps the author is not entirely in the wrong because the comment did attack a core part of his identity. Still, the method of handling it could be questioned.\n"
