Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author was a high-level trampoline athlete for 12 years, trained a lot, competed nationally and internationally for Canada. Then he quit because of a head injury. He met his girlfriend after retiring, and she knew about his sport. When they discussed sports, she said trampolining isn't a real sport, implying it's not as hard as other sports like soccer. He took offense, broke up with her, and now people are saying he was an asshole for doing so. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider what the girlfriend said. She said trampolining isn't a real sport and that he wouldn't have been good at a real sport like soccer. That's pretty dismissive of his achievements. The author clearly values his sport a lot, so this comment probably hurt his feelings. But is it fair for him to break up over that?\n\nRelationships often involve respecting each other's feelings and passions. If she belittled his sport, which was a huge part of his identity, that's a big deal. However, the way he reacted\u2014immediately breaking up\u2014might be seen as extreme. Maybe he could have talked it out or discussed why her comment hurt him instead of ending the relationship right there.\n\nOn the other hand, if someone makes a derogatory comment about something you're deeply passionate about, that could be a deal-breaker. It shows a lack of respect. The girlfriend's friends said he's an asshole, but maybe they don't understand the emotional impact of her words.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's statement that \"trampolining isn't a real sport\" is subjective. What's a real sport is debatable, but for someone who's invested so much time, hearing that it's not valid can feel like an attack on their identity. The author's reaction might be about feeling disrespected rather than the comment itself.\n\nSo, the key points are: the girlfriend dismissed his sport, which was a core part of his life. He took it as an attack on who he is and ended the relationship. The question is whether the breakup was justified. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect is crucial. If one partner undermines the other's achievements or passions, that can be a red flag. However, the immediate decision to break up might be seen as overreacting unless there were prior issues. The author might have felt that such a comment was a deal-breaker because it showed a lack of respect for his identity. \n\nOn the flip side, maybe the girlfriend's comment was a momentary lapse in judgment, and the author could have addressed it without ending the relationship. But given the emotional weight, perhaps he's justified in needing a partner who respects his background. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong. The girlfriend's comment was disrespectful, and ending the relationship over something that affects one's self-worth could be seen as reasonable. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
