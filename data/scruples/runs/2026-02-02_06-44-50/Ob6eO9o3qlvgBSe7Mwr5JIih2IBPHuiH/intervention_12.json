Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she called his sport, trampolining, not a real sport. The author has invested a lot of time and effort into trampolining, even representing Canada. The girlfriend made a comment that trampolining isn't a real sport and that he wouldn't have been good at a real sport like soccer. The author broke up immediately, and his girlfriend's friends think he's an asshole for overreacting. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants to know my opinion.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that his dedication and achievements in trampolining are significant and personal. Being dismissed by his partner could feel like an attack on his identity. On the other hand, the girlfriend's comment might have been a joke or a moment of frustration rather than a serious attack. She might not have realized how deeply this would affect him. \n\nBreaking up over a single comment, even if it's hurtful, is a big decision. It could be seen as overreacting, especially if the relationship had other issues. The girlfriend's friends think it's too harsh, which might indicate that her comment, while hurtful, isn't a deal-breaker for many people. However, if this comment struck a nerve because of the author's personal history and the importance of his sport, it's understandable that he felt validated in ending the relationship. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, relationships require communication and understanding. Maybe the author could have discussed his feelings without immediately ending things. Breaking up over one instance might not be fair, especially if there's a history of respect otherwise. However, if this comment was the culmination of long-standing issues or if it represented a fundamental disrespect that he couldn't overlook, then it's his right to leave. \n\nThe key is whether the action was a proportionate response. The girlfriend's friends think it's too small, but personal significance matters. It's a tough call. I think the author isn't in the wrong because the comment hit a sensitive spot and led to immediate action without giving the other a chance to explain or apologize. But maybe AITA (Am I the Asshole) often leans towards the person breaking up being the asshole if it's sudden. However, in this case, the emotional impact is real. I'm leaning towards B, not in the wrong, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe A, because it's a single comment leading to a breakup. Hmm.\n"
