Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, competing nationally and internationally, even receiving funding. After quitting due to injury, he met his girlfriend, who was aware of his achievements and seemed to think it was cool. However, during a conversation about sports, she dismissed trampolining as not a real sport, saying it's less competitive and that he wouldn't have been good at a more popular sport like soccer. The author then broke up with her immediately, and her friends and others think he's an asshole for overreacting. The author feels validated because he's been dismissed before, but the question is if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the breakup was justified. On one hand, the girlfriend's comments were dismissive and hurtful, especially given the author's significant personal investment in the sport. On the other hand, breaking up over a single conversation might be seen as extreme, even if the comment was hurtful. \n\nTrampolining is indeed an Olympic sport, so it is a recognized sport. The girlfriend's dismissal of it as not a real sport is factually incorrect, which might have compounded the hurt. The author's reaction is understandable from an emotional standpoint because the sport is a core part of his identity. However, relationships require communication and conflict resolution. Ending the relationship immediately without any discussion or attempt to address the underlying issues (like respect for each other's passions) might be seen as impulsive. \n\nBut considering that the comment directly attacked a significant part of his identity and self-worth, especially coming from someone in a close relationship, the emotional impact is substantial. People often react strongly when their core values or identities are undermined. The friends' reactions might not fully grasp the personal significance of the issue. \n\nHowever, in relationships, it's important to handle disagreements without immediate ultimatums. The author might have been justified in feeling disrespected, but the method of response (immediate breakup) could be seen as harsh. Yet, if the comment was a dealbreaker because it showed a lack of respect for his identity, then it might be justified. \n\nThe key here is whether the girlfriend's comment was a one-time incident or indicative of a deeper pattern. If it was an isolated incident, maybe the author overreacted. But if it was a reflection of her attitude towards his passions, then it might be a red flag. The story doesn't mention prior issues, so it's unclear. \n\nIn conclusion, while the girlfriend's comment was disrespectful, the immediate breakup might be seen as extreme. But given the emotional weight of the issue, the author's reaction might be understandable. So the answer could be B (No, he's not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's comment was a direct attack on his identity, which is a significant issue in a relationship. However, others might argue that it's an overreaction. Since the question is about the author's rightness, and the comment was factually wrong and hurtful, the answer might lean towards B.\n"
