Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after dumping his girlfriend for making fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author dedicated 12 years to a high-level sport, which is significant. Trampolining might not be as mainstream as soccer, but he's achieved national and international competition levels. The girlfriend's comment seems dismissive, equating his dedication to a less popular sport as not being real or hard. That's a clear disrespect to his effort and identity.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors are the nature of the argument and the appropriateness of breaking up over it. While the girlfriend's comments were hurtful, is a breakup the right response? The author was defensive about a core part of his identity, and the girlfriend's remarks might have been a one-time joke or misunderstanding. However, breaking up over a single conversation, even if it's about a personal value, might be seen as overreacting. The friends' opinions also weigh in, suggesting they think he's an asshole for overreacting.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction is rooted in his deep personal investment in his sport. The girlfriend's comments could be seen as undermining his identity and achievements. But the immediate breakup without attempts to discuss or understand if it was a genuine belief or a careless comment might be too drastic. The author's friends also mentioned that people have been dismissive of his sport before, which adds to the emotional weight.\n\nSo, considering all angles: the girlfriend's comment was disrespectful, the author's reaction was immediate and final. Whether the breakup was justified depends on whether the comment was a deal-breaker for their relationship. If the author's self-worth is tied to his sport being respected, then the breakup might be a valid reaction. However, in a relationship, communication and addressing issues before jumping to conclusions is usually advised. The author didn't attempt to discuss the comment further, which might make his action seem hasty. \n\nBut given the depth of personal investment and the girlfriend's dismissive attitude towards a significant part of his life, the author might feel that respect was a non-negotiable. The answer hinges on whether the breakup was a necessary step to protect his self-respect or an overreaction. Since the question is about being in the wrong, if the author acted on a genuine core value being disrespected, maybe he's not wrong. But if it was an overreaction without trying to resolve the issue, he might be. \n\nThe majority view here is likely that he's not in the wrong because the comment directly attacked a part of his identity he's worked hard for. The friends' reactions might be superficial. So, the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
