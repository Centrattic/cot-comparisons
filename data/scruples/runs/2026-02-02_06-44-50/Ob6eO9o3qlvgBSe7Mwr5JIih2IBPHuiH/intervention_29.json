Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she made fun of his sport, trampolining. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The author has spent 12 years in high-level trampolining, competing nationally and internationally, even getting funding. His injury forced him to quit, but it's a huge part of his identity. They met after he stopped, and she was initially supportive. Then during a conversation about sports, she comments that trampolining isn't a real sport, implying it's easier than something like soccer. He dumps her right then.\n\nThe key points here are the validity of the breakup and whether the offense was justified. The user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to assess both sides. The girlfriend's comment was dismissive and undermining his dedication. For someone who has invested so much into their sport, that could be a major dealbreaker. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that breaking up over a single comment is extreme. But considering the emotional weight of the comment and how it relates to his identity, it's not just a small thing. The author felt attacked, and if someone belittles a core part of who you are, that could be a red flag in a relationship. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's friends said he was an asshole, but sometimes people don't realize how their words affect others. The author's reaction is about self-respect and mutual respect in a relationship. If she can't respect his background, it might indicate deeper issues. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be in the wrong. He stood up for himself when his identity was being dismissed. The breakup, while sudden, could be justified if the comment highlighted a fundamental disrespect he couldn't overlook. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
