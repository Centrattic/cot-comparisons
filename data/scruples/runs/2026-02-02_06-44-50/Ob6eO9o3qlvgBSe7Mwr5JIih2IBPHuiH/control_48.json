Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend because she called trampolining not a real sport. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author was a high-level trampoline gymnast for 12 years, training 30 hours a week, competing nationally and internationally. They got funding and were in the top 500 worldwide. After retiring due to injury, they started a relationship with their girlfriend. She made a comment about trampolining not being a real sport, saying it's not as hard as soccer and that he wouldn't have been good at a real sport. The author took this as a personal attack and broke up immediately. Now, the author is asking if they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The author's sport is something that took a massive time investment, dedication, and achieved a high level. The girlfriend's comment could be seen as dismissive of their hard work and accomplishments. People might have different opinions on what constitutes a \"real sport,\" but for someone who put so much into their career, that comment could be hurtful.\n\nOn the other hand, relationships require communication and understanding. Maybe the girlfriend didn't realize how much it meant to the author. Did she mean to attack his identity? Maybe she made a thoughtless comment, not considering the emotional weight behind it. However, breaking up over a single comment might be a big reaction. The friends called the author an asshole for overreacting.\n\nBut let's look at the severity. The author's identity is tied up in their sport. The comment wasn't just about the sport but implied that their achievements were less valid. For someone who's been in a sport at such a high level, that could feel like an attack on their worth. Also, the girlfriend compared it to soccer, suggesting that in another sport, the author wouldn't have been good. That's a bit of an insult, not just to the sport but to the author's abilities.\n\nHowever, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Breaking up over this might seem extreme to some, but if the comment hit a nerve that's been sensitive for years (as the author mentions others have said similar things), then maybe the reaction is understandable. Relationships can't survive if one partner consistently undermines the other's core values or achievements. But on the flip side, maybe the author should have addressed it earlier or given the girlfriend a chance to explain or apologize instead of ending it immediately.\n\nThe key factors here are the importance of the sport to the author's identity and how the girlfriend's comment minimized that. If the girlfriend is dismissive of his passion, that could lead to bigger issues in the relationship. The author might feel that their significant achievements aren't respected, which is a big deal. On the other hand, maybe the girlfriend's comment was a one-time thing, and the author overreacted without giving her a chance to reconcile.\n\nIn conclusion, while breaking up over a single comment is extreme, the context of the author's deep emotional attachment to their sport and the girlfriend's dismissive remark might justify the reaction. However, handling it without immediate breakup could have been better. But given the circumstances, the author might not be in the wrong because the comment attacked a core part of their identity, which is significant in a relationship.\n"
