Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up a girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining. He's been very dedicated to it for 12 years, was a national athlete, and now she calls it not a real sport.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author feels that his dedication and achievements are being invalidated. Trampolining might not be as mainstream as soccer, but he's achieved a high level, so his reaction is understandable. On the other hand, the girlfriend made a dismissive comment. Is that a dealbreaker?\n\nThe author dumped her immediately after the conversation. Breaking up over a single comment, even if it's hurtful, might be seen as overreacting. However, the comment might have triggered deeper insecurities or past experiences of being undervalued. The friends said he's an asshole for breaking up over something small, but maybe they don't understand the emotional impact.\n\nIs trampolining a \"real sport\"? That's subjective. The International Olympic Committee recognizes it as a sport. So the girlfriend's dismissal might be factually incorrect. But the way she phrased it could be seen as condescending. \n\nThe key here is whether the comment was a valid criticism or just a minor disagreement. The author's response was immediate and final. In relationships, communication is key. Instead of ending things, a discussion to understand each other's perspectives might have been better. But if the author felt that his identity was attacked, maybe the breakup is justified. \n\nIt's a tricky balance. The author has every right to be upset about being disrespected. However, reacting by ending the relationship without giving room for discussion could be seen as hasty. The girlfriend's comment was hurtful, but breaking up over it might be extreme. \n\nGiven that the author's sport is significant to his identity and the comment dismissed his accomplishments, the emotional reaction isn't entirely unfounded. But the immediate breakup without trying to resolve the issue could be seen as the author's fault. So maybe he's in the wrong because relationships require working through conflicts, not ending them over a single argument. Alternatively, if the comment was a dealbreaker for him, maybe not. \n\nThe friends called him an asshole, which might indicate that society often sees this as overreacting. But if the comment was a trigger for deeper issues, like feeling undervalued, then it's more complex. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the breakup was a proportionate response. The comment was disrespectful, but the response was immediate and final. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not addressing it constructively. Therefore, answer A.\n"
