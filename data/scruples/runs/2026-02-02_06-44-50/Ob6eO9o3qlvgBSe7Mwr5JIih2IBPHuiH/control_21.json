Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that he broke up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining. He's been into it for 12 years, was a national athlete, got funding, and then had to quit due to an injury. The girlfriend said trampolining isn't a real sport and implied others can get better at real sports like soccer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy's sport is a big part of his identity. He's put in a lot of time and effort, and it's a significant achievement. When someone dismisses something that important to you, it can be really hurtful. The girlfriend's comments might have been a trigger for his breakup decision.\n\nBut then, maybe the girlfriend didn't mean it maliciously. She might have been making a joke or not realizing how much it meant to him. However, she did make a direct comparison saying that if he played a real sport like soccer, he wouldn't be as good. That's a bit of an insult to his dedication and skill.\n\nThe key factors here are intent and the value of the relationship. The author felt that her comments attacked his identity and achievements. Breaking up over that shows that he values his self-worth tied to his sport. But is it overreacting? The friends said he's an asshole, suggesting that maybe the issue is small. However, for him, it's a major issue because of the personal significance.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might not have realized the emotional impact of her words. If she's not being malicious, maybe the author could have addressed it in a less drastic way. But if she has a history of minimizing his achievements or other issues, then the breakup is justified.\n\nThe problem is that the author didn't give her a chance to apologize or explain. He broke up immediately. That might be hasty. The question is whether the offense was valid enough to end the relationship. Since trampolining is indeed a recognized sport (it's an Olympic sport, for example), her dismissal could be seen as ignorant or dismissive. The author's reaction, while intense, is about respect for his dedication.\n\nIn the AITA context, the community often looks at whether the action was proportionate. Dumping someone over a joke could be seen as excessive unless it's a recurring issue. However, if this was a one-time comment but it hit a nerve about his identity, maybe it's understandable. The friends' reactions might be biased, but they might also see this as overreacting. The answer hinges on whether the girlfriend's comment was a reasonable joke or a genuine attack on his achievements.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because the comment did attack his significant personal achievements and identity. However, the immediate breakup might be a problem. But given the context, the hurt and the value he places on his sport, it's a valid reason. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
