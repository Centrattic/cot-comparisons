Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she mocked his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a national athlete, trained extensively, and received funding. His sport is significant to his identity. The girlfriend made a comment dismissing trampolining as not a \"real sport,\" comparing it to something like soccer, implying it's easy. This led to the breakup.\n\nThe key points here are the validity of the breakup based on the offense taken. The girlfriend's comment was clearly hurtful and disrespectful towards something the author holds in high regard. Trampolining is recognized as a sport by the IOC, so her statement is factually incorrect. However, the issue isn't just about facts but about the emotional impact.\n\nThe author felt attacked because the sport was a huge part of his identity. The comment could be seen as belittling his years of dedication. On the other hand, some might argue that the breakup was overreacting to a single comment. But considering the emotional significance and the history of the author facing similar sentiments from others, the reaction is more understandable.\n\nThe girlfriend's friends called the author an asshole, but their perspective might not account for the deep personal value he places on his sport. The question is whether a single disrespectful comment justifies a breakup. While it's a big step, the context of years of dedication and the personal attack on his identity supports the author's stance. The girlfriend's comment showed a lack of respect for his achievements, which is a valid reason for someone to feel betrayed or disrespected. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
