Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The guy asked if he's in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she called trampolining a real sport. The user wants an answer A or B.\n\nFirst, the situation: He's a former elite trampolinist, dedicated 12 years, national/international competitions, funding. She made fun of his sport, saying it's not a real sport, and that it wasn't as hard as something like soccer. He felt attacked and broke up immediately. Her friends think he's an asshole for overreacting. He's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here. The guy's sport is not mainstream, and maybe there's a stereotype that it's not taken seriously. She dismissed his dedication and implied that his achievement wasn't significant compared to others. He took it as a personal attack on his identity and work. \n\nIs breaking up over a comment about a sport justified? Well, relationships can break over things that seem small to others. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. The girlfriend's friends think he's an asshole, but maybe they don't understand the emotional weight of his dedication. \n\nTrampolining is an Olympic sport, so technically it's a real sport. But maybe in everyday language, people might not see it as such. Her comment could be seen as dismissive or belittling. The guy felt it was an attack on his identity. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, is it the author's fault? Well, he acted immediately, which might suggest impulsiveness. However, if the comment touched a deep emotional nerve from years of dedication, maybe it's not entirely his fault. The problem is that the comment was disrespectful, but the response (breaking up) is extreme. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. Typically, breaking up over a single conversation can be seen as overreacting unless there's a history of similar issues. However, if this comment was the culmination of long-standing feelings, maybe not. The story mentions he felt attacked and that it's a sentiment he's received his whole life. So maybe it was a breaking point.\n\nIn summary, while the comment was hurtful and dismissive, the immediate breakup might be seen as disproportionate unless there were prior issues. However, since the relationship was only a few months old, maybe it's understandable if their values were incompatible (respect for each other's achievements). The answer might hinge on whether the comment was a one-time thing or part of a pattern. Since it's a one-time thing, he might be in the wrong for overreacting. But his feelings about his dedication being dismissed could be valid. \n\nBut according to the AITA format, the answer often leans towards the person who acted decisively. If the comment was a deal-breaker for him, maybe not in the wrong. But if it's a small issue, maybe A. However, given the depth of his dedication, perhaps the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
