Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author was a high-level national athlete in trampolining, dedicating 12 years and thousands of hours, even getting funding. He quit due to injury. He met his girlfriend after he stopped competing. She played volleyball in high school but not as intensely. During a conversation, she dismissed trampolining as not a \"real sport,\" implying it's less demanding than other sports like soccer. The author was hurt and dumped her immediately. Her friends say he's an asshole for breaking up over something small. The author is seeking opinions on whether he's at fault.\n\nNow, the user's own thought is that the author is in the wrong, but they want to know if I agree. The answer should be A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nAnalyzing the situation: The key factors are the value of the sport, the girlfriend's comment, the reaction, and the relationship dynamics. \n\nTrampolining is a recognized Olympic sport in some events like trampoline gymnastics. The author's dedication is real and significant. However, the girlfriend's comment was dismissive, which can be hurtful. But is breaking up over that excessive? \n\nIn relationships, respect is crucial. Dismissing someone's passion can be a valid reason to leave, especially if it's tied to their identity. However, the reaction's proportionality matters. Dumping someone immediately after a single conversation might be seen as overreacting, especially if there's no prior history of similar issues. \n\nThe girlfriend might not have intended to belittle his achievements but was comparing her own experience to his. Maybe she didn't realize the significance of the sport to him. On the other hand, the author's reaction might have been a culmination of past feelings where others didn't take his sport seriously. \n\nThe friends' reactions suggest that the breakup was over a small issue, which could indicate that the author's response was too harsh. But if the comment was a dealbreaker for him, then it's his right to end the relationship. However, in relationships, communication and addressing issues before taking drastic actions are important. Ending a relationship immediately without discussion might be seen as impulsive. \n\nConsidering these points, the author might have overreacted. While the girlfriend's comment was disrespectful, the immediate breakup without giving her a chance to explain or apologize could be seen as the author's fault. So, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong). But I need to be careful here. Alternatively, if the sport is a core part of his identity, and her dismissal was an attack on that, then it's a valid reason. \n\nIt's a tough call. The key is whether the reaction was proportionate. Since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, if the breakup was too hasty, then A. If the girlfriend's comment was a legitimate dealbreaker, then B. Given the context, the friends say it's too small, which might lean towards A. The author's own history of feeling dismissed might justify his reaction, but acting impulsively could still be his fault. \n\nI think the answer is A because breaking up immediately over one comment, especially after saying nothing before, is an overreaction. There's a lack of communication and opportunity to resolve the issue. So the author is in the wrong for not addressing it constructively and ending the relationship abruptly.\n"
