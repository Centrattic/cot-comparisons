Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was a high-level trampoline athlete, dedicating 12 years and over 30 hours a week. He quit due to injury. They met after he stopped competing. She used to play volleyball. During a discussion about sports, she dismissed trampolining as not a real sport, implying it's less challenging than other sports like soccer. The author took this as an attack on his identity and dumped her. Her friends say he was an asshole for breaking up over that.\n\nNow, considering the factors. The author's dedication was significant, and the sport was a huge part of his identity. The girlfriend's comment could be seen as dismissive and disrespectful. However, breaking up over such a comment might be extreme. But the key is whether her statement was a legitimate criticism or just a joke. The author felt attacked, which is valid if she was being serious. If she was making a joke, maybe the reaction was too harsh. But the story doesn't mention if she was joking. The author interpreted it as an attack, and that's a valid emotional response. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's own sport background (volleyball) is mentioned, but she didn't achieve the same level. The fact that she downplays his sport despite his achievements might show a lack of respect for his effort and accomplishments. The author's reaction could be seen as standing up for his identity, which is important in a relationship. However, some might argue that taking a joke too seriously is overreacting. \n\nBut the core issue here is respect. If she was being serious and belittling his sport, then the author is justified in leaving. If she was just teasing and there's no pattern of disrespect, maybe the author overreacted. The story doesn't clarify if it was a joke. However, given the context and the author's emotional response, it's plausible he felt disrespected. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect is crucial. If one partner can't respect the other's passions and achievements, that's a red flag. The author's dedication and the girlfriend's dismissal might indicate a fundamental incompatibility. So, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship when his core identity was attacked. The friends' opinion that he's an asshole might stem from not understanding the depth of his feelings towards the sport. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
