Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a national athlete, got funding, and it was a huge part of his identity. He's proud of his achievements. The girlfriend, who plays volleyball, dismissed trampolining as not a real sport, saying it's not hard and that he wouldn't be good at a real sport like soccer. The author took this as an attack on his identity and dumped her. Now, her friends and others are saying he's an asshole for overreacting.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author's reaction was justified. Let's consider both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, trampolining is a significant part of his identity. He invested a lot into it, and her comments could be seen as belittling his hard work and dedication. For someone who has poured their life into a sport, having it dismissed might feel like a personal attack. The injury and the end of his career might add to the emotional sensitivity here. The breakup was immediate, which could suggest that the issue was a deal-breaker for him.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend made a personal comment that might be seen as dismissive. However, the way she framed it could be a matter of opinion. She might not have intended to attack his entire identity but rather was expressing her own view on sports. People have different perspectives on what constitutes a \"real sport,\" and her volleyball background could influence her perspective. But the way she downplayed his achievements and implied that other sports are more valid might have crossed a line.\n\nThe key point here is whether her statement was a legitimate criticism of the sport versus a personal attack. If she was making a general statement and not attacking his personal achievements, then the author's reaction might be too harsh. However, if her comments were personal, mocking his dedication and downplaying his accomplishments, then his reaction could be more understandable.\n\nAnother angle is communication. Maybe they had a history of discussing sports and this was a recurring issue, but the story doesn't mention that. The breakup was immediate, which might indicate that the comment struck a nerve that had been building up. The friends' reactions are mixed; some think he's being an asshole, but the author feels it's a valid reason. \n\nIn relationships, validity of reasons for breaking up can be subjective. If the issue is about mutual respect and valuation of each other's passions, then dismissing someone's significant life achievement could be a problem. However, breaking up over one comment might be seen as excessive unless there were prior issues. \n\nThe author's dedication and the emotional weight he attaches to his sport are valid. The girlfriend's comment, while perhaps not intended to be malicious, might have been careless. The decision to end the relationship was his choice, and whether it's right depends on how much weight he should place on his identity versus her opinion.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because the issue was a core part of his identity, and her comment was dismissive. However, some might argue that reacting with a breakup is too extreme. But given the context of his investment in the sport, his feelings are justified. The answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
