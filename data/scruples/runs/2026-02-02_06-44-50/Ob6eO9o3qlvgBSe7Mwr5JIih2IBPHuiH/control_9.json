Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy spent 12 years dedicated to trampolining, was a national-level athlete, got funding, and it was a huge part of his identity. He quit due to injury. Then he meets his girlfriend, who knew about his sport and seemed to think it was cool. Later, during a conversation about sports, she says that trampolining isn't a real sport, argues that it's not as hard as something like soccer, and insinuates he wouldn't have been good at a \"real\" sport. He dumps her immediately because it felt like an attack on who he is. His friends say he's an asshole for breaking up over something small. He's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key factors here are: the girl's comment was a direct dismissal of his lifelong dedication and achievement, which was central to his identity. He took it very personally, leading to immediate breakup. The friends think it's overreacting, but he's defending his choice.\n\nNow, to decide if he's in the wrong. The main points to consider are whether the comment was a legitimate criticism or an attack, and whether the breakup was an appropriate response. \n\nTrampolining is an Olympic sport, so it's recognized as a sport. However, some people might downplay it because it's less popular or requires specific facilities. The girl's comment seems to devalue his hard work and dedication by saying it's not a real sport and that it's easier to reach high levels in it compared to something like soccer. That's a judgment about the value of his effort, which can be hurtful, especially when it's a core part of one's identity.\n\nThe man's reaction was immediate breakup. Breaking up over a single comment might seem drastic, but if that comment touched a deep personal value (his dedication and identity), it's understandable. However, people might argue that a breakup should be based on bigger issues and that this was an overreaction. Others might say that if someone feels disrespected about something so important to them, ending the relationship is justified.\n\nThe friends' opinions are divided. His friends think he's wrong, but his reasoning is that the comment attacked his identity. There's a balance between respecting someone's values and not overreacting to a single statement. Perhaps if it was a one-time comment and there's a chance to discuss and understand each other's perspectives, breaking up immediately might be too hasty. However, if the comment revealed underlying disrespect or if the girl had a pattern of belittling his passions, it might be more justified.\n\nIn this case, the girl's comment was a direct dismissal of a central part of his identity. While the man's reaction was immediate, the emotional impact and the importance of the issue to him might be valid. So, whether he's in the wrong depends on weighing the severity of the comment versus the appropriateness of the response. If the comment was a valid critique (though it's not), but since it was a disrespectful dismissal of his hard work, the breakup could be seen as a justified defense of his self-worth.\n"
