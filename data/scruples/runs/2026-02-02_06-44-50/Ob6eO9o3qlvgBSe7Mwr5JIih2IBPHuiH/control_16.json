Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend because she called trampolining not a real sport. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author spent 12 years dedicated to trampolining, was a top Canadian athlete, got funding, and had a significant injury. His identity is tied to this sport. The girlfriend made a comment downplaying his achievements, suggesting trampolining isn't a real sport and that he wouldn't be good at a more popular sport like soccer. The author took it as an attack on his identity and broke up immediately.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics. The argument is about respect. The girlfriend's comment could be seen as dismissive or belittling. However, people have different opinions on sports. Some might find trampolining less \"real\" compared to others, but that's subjective. The key is whether her comment was a one-time joke or part of a pattern of disrespect.\n\nThe author's reaction was immediate breakup. Is that a proportionate response? If someone's core identity is attacked, even if the comment is subjective, it might be a deal-breaker. The girlfriend's friends think it's too harsh, but that's their perspective. The author felt attacked, which is valid if it's tied to his self-worth.\n\nFactors to consider: Was the comment a one-time thing or part of a pattern? If it's a one-off, maybe the author overreacted. But if the comment struck a nerve because of long-standing insecurities or past experiences, it's more about respect. The girlfriend's friends might not understand the depth of the issue. \n\nAlso, the author's dedication to the sport is significant. Being told that his effort isn't valued can feel like a personal attack. The girlfriend's comparison to soccer might be based on her own perspective, but it dismisses his achievements. In relationships, respecting each other's passions is important. If she didn't respect his dedication, there might be deeper issues.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the comment was a valid opinion, but the reaction was disproportionate, maybe. But if the comment was disrespectful and the author felt it undermined his identity, then breaking up might be justified. The answer depends on whether the comment was a harmless opinion or a disrespectful attack. Since the author felt it was an attack and it's a major part of his identity, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, breaking up over a single comment could be seen as extreme. But given the context, it's a grey area. The community might side with the author if they see the comment as disrespectful. Alternatively, others might think the sport's status isn't that important. But given the context of the author's life dedication, B seems plausible.\n"
