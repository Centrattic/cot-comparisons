Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend because she called trampolining not a real sport. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author put a lot of time and effort into trampolining, which is a big part of their identity. The girlfriend made a dismissive comment about the sport, comparing it to something like soccer. That must have been really hurtful, especially since it's such a significant part of the author's life. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have just been making a joke or not realizing how much the sport meant to him. She played volleyball herself, so maybe she didn't mean to belittle his achievements. But even if it was a joke, the comment was still invalidating his hard work and dedication.\n\nThe author decided to break up immediately. That's a big reaction. People might say that overreacting, especially since relationships have ups and downs and not every argument should end in a breakup. But if the comment hit a nerve and felt like an attack on his identity, maybe it's understandable. \n\nThe friends said the author is an asshole, but they might not know the full context. The author's friends might not realize how central trampolining was to his identity. The girlfriend's friends might be defending her because they don't see the issue either.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Breaking up over something like that could be seen as harsh, but if the comment was a dealbreaker for the author, maybe not. It depends on whether the comment was a one-time thing or part of a pattern. If it was a one-time joke that the author took seriously, maybe the author is overreacting. But if the girlfriend had a history of dismissing his passions, then it makes sense.\n\nIn the scenario, the girlfriend's comment was dismissive and compared his sport to something else, which the author found offensive. The author might have felt that the comment wasn't just about the sport but about his dedication and achievements. So, the breakup might be justified because the comment attacked his identity and hard work.\n\nAlternatively, the author could have addressed the comment calmly and discussed why it hurt him. Breaking up immediately might not be the healthiest approach, but if the relationship was already strained or the girlfriend was dismissive, maybe it's a valid decision.\n\nI think it's a bit of both sides, but the main issue is whether the comment was a significant enough dealbreaker. Since the sport was such a huge part of the author's life, the comment could be a dealbreaker. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
