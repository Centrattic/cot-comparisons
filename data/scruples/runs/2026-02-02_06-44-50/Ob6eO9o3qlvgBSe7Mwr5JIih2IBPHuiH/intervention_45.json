Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, competing nationally and internationally, and it's a significant part of his identity. When his girlfriend dismisses trampolining as not a \"real sport,\" he takes it as a personal attack, leading to an immediate breakup. His friends and the girlfriend's friends think he's being too harsh.\n\nNow, to evaluate if he's in the wrong. Relationships require mutual respect and understanding. While the girlfriend's comment was clearly hurtful and dismissive, breaking up over one conversation seems extreme. The key factors here are the history of the relationship and the significance of the sport to him. However, relationships also involve communication. If the author had feelings about his sport being undervalued, maybe he should have addressed it earlier or discussed it calmly instead of ending the relationship abruptly. On the other hand, the girlfriend's statement was disrespectful, which might be a valid reason to leave if it reflects a deeper lack of respect for his achievements. But the immediate breakup without giving her the chance to apologize or explain could be seen as impulsive. \n\nIn many cases, people might expect the couple to talk it out before making a final decision. The author's reaction is justified in terms of feeling disrespected, but the action of dumping her immediately might be considered overreacting. So, the answer depends on whether the comment was a one-time thing or indicative of a pattern. Since it's presented as a single incident, the author's overreaction could make him at fault.\n"
