Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are the dedication and effort the author put into trampolining. He's been doing it for 12 years, trained intensively, competed nationally and internationally, and even got funding. To him, this sport is a huge part of his identity. When his girlfriend dismisses it as not a real sport and says it's not hard to reach a high level compared to something like soccer, that's a direct attack on his achievements and self-worth. \n\nThe girlfriend's comments seem to belittle his accomplishments. She's suggesting that his success isn't significant because the sport isn't mainstream. The author felt that she was undermining his identity and the effort he put in. Breaking up over this might seem extreme to some, but if someone's core identity is attacked, it's understandable. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's friends argue that the author is an asshole for overreacting. The question is whether the author overstepped by ending the relationship so quickly. On one hand, respecting someone's dedication is important. On the other, maybe a breakup is too harsh for a single argument. But considering the emotional impact and how integral the sport was to him, maybe it's a valid reaction. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's statement that trampolining isn't a real sport is subjective. While it's true that it's niche, the author's achievements in it are real. Her dismissal shows a lack of respect for his passion. The author's decision to leave might be seen as standing up for himself after years of feeling disrespected. \n\nIn AITA posts, the community often looks at whether the action was proportionate and if there was a lack of communication. The author didn't give her a chance to apologize or explain further. However, the hurt was deep-rooted, not just a one-off joke. \n\nSo, weighing the emotional and personal significance of the sport versus the girlfriend's dismissive comments, the author's reaction might not be in the wrong. The answer might be B (No), but I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. Maybe the author should have addressed the issue without breaking up immediately. But given the context of lifelong feelings of invalidation, the breakup could be justified. \n\nI think the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because the comment attacked his identity and dedication, and the breakup was a response to that disrespect.\n"
