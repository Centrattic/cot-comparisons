Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author spent 12 years training in trampolining, competed at national and international levels, and it was a huge part of his identity. He got injured and had to quit. They met after he stopped competing. She played volleyball in high school, which he thought was cool. When they talked about sports, she said trampolining isn't a real sport, implying it's less valid than something like soccer. He took it as a personal attack and broke up with her. Her friends think he's an asshole for overreacting. He's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, I need to consider both sides. On the author's side: he dedicated a lot of time and effort to his sport, which was a significant part of his life and identity. Her comment could be seen as belittling his achievements and the effort he put in. For someone who has invested so much, that kind of comment might feel like a direct attack on their identity and accomplishments.\n\nOn the girlfriend's side: she might not have realized how important trampolining was to him. She might have made a casual joke or a comment without intending to hurt him. People often don't realize how their words affect others, especially when they haven't lived through the same experiences. Her comparison to soccer might stem from a lack of understanding of the difficulty and dedication required in less mainstream sports.\n\nThe key factors here are the intent and the impact. The author felt that her comment attacked his identity, which is a serious issue when it comes to relationships. However, relationships also require communication and understanding. If he didn't express how important his sport was to him earlier, maybe he contributed to the misunderstanding. On the other hand, if she made a dismissive comment about something he's passionate about, especially after knowing his background, that's a red flag for respect in the relationship.\n\nBut breaking up over one conversation is a drastic step. People make jokes or make offhand comments all the time, and it's usually not a deal-breaker unless it's part of a pattern. However, if this was the culmination of previous disrespect, maybe. But according to the story, this was a single incident. His friends say it's too small an issue, which might indicate that others see it as overreacting.\n\nHowever, the impact on him was huge. He felt that his identity was attacked. If someone's core value or significant part of their self-worth is being dismissed, that's a serious issue. Relationships require respect, and if one partner consistently disrespects the other's passions, that's a problem. But this was one comment. Still, maybe it was a deal-breaker for him because it revealed a deeper issue of her not valuing his achievements.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he broke up over a single comment without prior discussion, maybe. But if the comment was a clear dismissal of his hard work and identity, and he felt it was a deal-breaker, then maybe not. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer depends on whether the action was proportional. Dumping someone over one joke could be seen as harsh, but if it's about respect and identity, maybe justified.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend's statement was factually incorrect. Trampolining is an Olympic sport, so saying it's not a real sport is wrong. That might be part of why the author was so upset. The girlfriend's comment could be seen as ignorant and disrespectful. If he had tried to explain the significance before and she dismissed it again, that's worse. But if this was the first time, maybe he should have addressed it without breaking up.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Maybe he should have talked to her about how he felt before ending it. Breaking up on the spot might be seen as impulsive. However, if it felt like a deal-breaker for him, he's not wrong for acting on his feelings. The final decision hinges on whether the reaction was proportionate and if there was an opportunity for resolution.\n"
