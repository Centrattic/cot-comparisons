Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who broke up with their girlfriend over her comment about trampolining not being a \"real sport\" is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The guy has dedicated 12 years to trampolining, national level competitions, and it was a huge part of his identity. He was getting funding and was top 500 worldwide. The girlfriend made a comment implying trampolining isn't a real sport compared to others, and he broke up with her. Friends say he's an asshole for overreacting.\n\nNow, evaluating if he's in the wrong. On one hand, the comment could be seen as dismissive of his dedication and achievements. If something is such a big part of your identity, being told it's not valid can feel like a personal attack. The girlfriend's friends might not understand how hurt he was, but for someone with such a history, this isn't just a small comment\u2014it's about respect for his identity and hard work.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the comment was a joke or a passing remark. If the girlfriend didn't mean it seriously, then breaking up over it could be seen as overreacting. But the key here is the context: he had been open about his dedication, and she dismissed his sport. That might be more than a joke. Also, the fact that her friends called it small suggests they might not see the emotional weight behind it, but others in similar situations might disagree.\n\nThe question is whether the reaction was disproportionate. Breaking up is a huge step. If the relationship had other issues, maybe, but the story doesn't mention that. It seems like this was the breaking point because of the personal significance. However, relationships require communication and understanding. Was this a dealbreaker? Some might argue that the guy should have addressed the comment and discussed his feelings instead of breaking up immediately. Others would say that if a partner undermines your identity, it's a major red flag.\n\nBut considering that trampolining is an Olympic sport and there's no objective reason it's not a real sport, her comment could be seen as ignorant or disrespectful. The guy's reaction might be justified if he felt disrespected. However, the suddenness of the breakup without prior discussions might be an issue. Still, given the emotional impact, some might side with him.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the comment was a legitimate disrespect versus a minor joke. The girlfriend's friends seem to think it's minor, but the guy's perspective is that it's a major issue. Since the question asks if the author is in the wrong, if the comment was indeed disrespectful and the breakup was a response to that disrespect, then he might not be in the wrong. However, if the comment was a joke and he overreacted, then he's in the wrong. The story doesn't clarify if the comment was a joke or not. But given the context, the comment seems to undermine his hard work, which could justify his reaction. So, answer B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
