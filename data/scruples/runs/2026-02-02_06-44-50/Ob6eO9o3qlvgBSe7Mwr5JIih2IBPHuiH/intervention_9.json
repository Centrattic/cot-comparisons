Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who dumps his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The guy dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a high-level athlete, even got funding. He quit due to an injury. He met the girlfriend after he stopped competing. She played volleyball in high school. During a conversation about sports, she says trampolining isn't a real sport, implying it's less valid than others like soccer. He takes it personally and breaks up with her. Her friends say he's being an asshole for overreacting.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to decide if A (Yes, he's wrong) or B (No, he's not wrong) is correct. \n\nFactors to consider: Did her comment deserve such a strong reaction? Is dismissing someone's passion as not a \"real sport\" a valid reason to break up? How important is the sport to his identity? How did the relationship handle such issues before?\n\nThe guy's perspective: The sport is a huge part of his identity, he put in thousands of hours, and felt attacked. He might see her comment as belittling his achievements. But breaking up immediately over a single conversation might be seen as overreacting. \n\nHer comment was dismissive and possibly ignorant. She might not realize how much the sport meant to him. However, people have different opinions on what constitutes a \"real sport,\" and she might not have intended to hurt him. \n\nThe friends think it's too small a reason. But if the comment struck a nerve because of his deep connection to the sport, maybe his reaction is justified. However, relationships require communication and understanding. Instead of breaking up immediately, maybe he should have discussed his feelings first. \n\nAlso, the fact that she played volleyball and he respected that, but she didn't respect his sport, might be an issue of mutual respect. Yet, breaking up over one argument can be seen as extreme. \n\nIn AITA cases, the community often looks at whether the action was a proportionate response. If the comment was a one-off and not part of a pattern, maybe the breakup is too harsh. On the other hand, if it's a dealbreaker for him because it's about core values, it's his choice. \n\nI think the key here is that the author acted impulsively. Breaking up immediately without discussing could be seen as wrong. However, if the comment was a dealbreaker because it represented disrespect for a core part of his identity, then it's a personal choice. But society often looks at immediate breakups over single incidents as overreacting unless there's a pattern. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because the reaction was too severe. But there's also validity in his feelings. However, in AITA contexts, the community tends to side with not overreacting unless it's a clear violation. So leaning towards A (Yes, he's wrong).\n"
