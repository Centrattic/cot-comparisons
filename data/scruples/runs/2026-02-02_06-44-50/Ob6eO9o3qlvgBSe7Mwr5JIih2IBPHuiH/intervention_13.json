Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend because she mocked his sport. The guy has been into trampolining for 12 years, was a national athlete, got funding, and quit due to injury. His girlfriend made fun of trampolining as \"not a real sport\" and claimed it's easy compared to something like soccer. He broke up with her, but his friends think he's an asshole for overreacting.\n\nHmm, so the key points here. First, the guy's dedication and the significance of his sport in his life. Trampolining being a niche sport might lead to misunderstandings about its difficulty and legitimacy. The girlfriend's comments seem dismissive and disrespectful, especially given his achievements. On the other hand, breaking up over this could be seen as overreacting, but maybe not if the comment struck a personal nerve.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but I need to weigh both sides. The girlfriend's statement could be hurtful, especially if it's a core part of his identity. But is it fair to end the relationship over one comment? Maybe if this was a recurring issue, but it seems like a single incident. However, the fact that her friends said he's an asshole for overreacting suggests others view it as a minor issue. Yet, the emotional impact on the author is significant.\n\nTrampolining is an Olympic sport, so technically it's a \"real\" sport. The girlfriend's dismissal might reflect a lack of understanding or respect for his achievements. The author's reaction might be justified if the comment invalidated his hard work and identity. But breaking up immediately might be an overreaction unless there's a history of similar issues. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers intent and impact. Even if the comment was a joke, the impact here was real. But if it's a one-time thing and not part of a pattern, maybe the break-up is too harsh. However, if the comment deeply hurt and devalued his identity, some might see it as a justified decision. \n\nI'm torn. On one hand, reacting to a single offhand comment with a breakup seems extreme. On the other hand, the comment was about something central to his self-worth. The community's typical response to such posts would probably say the author is not wrong because the comment was disrespectful, but maybe some would say it's an overreaction. But since the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong, and given the context, I think the answer leans towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's statement was a direct attack on his personal achievements and passion.\n"
