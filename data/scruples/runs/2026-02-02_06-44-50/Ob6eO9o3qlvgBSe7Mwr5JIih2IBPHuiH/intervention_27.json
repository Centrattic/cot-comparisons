Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her making fun of his sport, trampolining. The author dedicated 12 years to it, was a national athlete, and got funding. The girlfriend said trampolining isn't a real sport and that it's easy to get good at compared to real sports like soccer.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the emotional impact on the author, the validity of the girlfriend's comments, and whether the breakup was justified. The author felt that the comment was an attack on his identity and dedication. The girlfriend's friends criticized him for being an asshole over something small. \n\nFirst, the author's dedication is significant. He trained for 30 hours a week, got funding, and competed internationally. To him, this sport is a big part of his identity. Her comments might have felt like a dismissal of his hard work. On the other hand, calling a sport \"not real\" or implying it's less valid compared to others is a judgment that can come off as dismissive. But is that enough to warrant a breakup?\n\nPeople have different perspectives on sports. Some might see trampolining as a niche sport but still valid. The girlfriend's own sport was volleyball, which she played in high school. Her comment that it's different because trampolining isn't a \"real sport\" and that you can get good easily is problematic. It's not just about the sport itself but the disrespect towards the author's achievements.\n\nHowever, breaking up over a single conversation is a big reaction. The girlfriend's friends think it's too harsh. But for the author, this might have been the breaking point after feeling undervalued for a long time. Maybe there were prior issues, but the story doesn't mention any. The key is whether the reaction was disproportionate. \n\nThe girlfriend's statement was a direct attack on his self-worth and dedication. If someone is disrespectful about a core part of your identity, that can be a deal-breaker. The author might feel that this wasn't just a joke or a small comment but a fundamental disrespect. In relationships, respecting each other's passions is important. If she didn't respect his, maybe he felt the relationship wasn't sustainable. \n\nBut then again, maybe there's room for dialogue. He could have talked about why her comments hurt and discussed it. However, if this was a recurring issue, the breakup makes sense. The story doesn't indicate prior conflicts, though. It was a single incident. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer hinges on whether the author's reaction was justified given the emotional weight of the situation. If the girlfriend's remark was a major disrespect and the breakup was the culmination of feeling undervalued, then maybe he's not in the wrong. But if it's overreacting to a single comment, he might be. The community often values communication, but in cases where identity is attacked, it's more complex.\n"
