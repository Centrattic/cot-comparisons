Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong after breaking up with his girlfriend because she mocked his sport, trampolining. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a national-level athlete, and had significant achievements. His girlfriend made fun of the sport, calling it not a real sport and implying it's less challenging than others like soccer. The author felt this was a personal attack because the sport was a huge part of his identity. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's friends think the breakup was over a small issue. Maybe they see it as a minor comment that doesn't justify ending a relationship. The key here is whether the comment was a legitimate attack on his passion or an innocent joke that was taken the wrong way.\n\nI should think about the emotional impact. For someone who's invested so much time and effort, having their passion belittled can feel like an attack on their identity. The author's reaction is immediate\u2014dumping her on the spot. That's a big decision, so maybe others see it as overreacting.\n\nBut the girlfriend's statement does seem dismissive. She's comparing trampolining to soccer, suggesting it's less valid. That could be seen as undermining his achievements. However, people might not realize how important the sport was to him. \n\nAnother angle: Is trampolining considered a \"real\" sport? It's an Olympic sport, so by that standard, yes. But some people might not be aware of that, or they might have a different perception. The author's frustration is valid if she didn't recognize the legitimacy and difficulty of his chosen sport.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's background in volleyball, which she mentions, might make her more appreciative of sports in general. However, her comment could have been a thoughtless remark, not intending to hurt him. The author's response is immediate, which might be seen as impulsive. \n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, communication is key. Maybe she could have been more thoughtful, but the author could have also addressed the issue without breaking up. However, if this was a dealbreaker for him, it's his right to end the relationship if he feels his core identity is being attacked.\n\nSo, considering all factors: The author's investment in his sport is huge, and her comment felt like a personal attack. His reaction is extreme, but if the core of his identity was being undermined, maybe it's understandable. The friends' reaction that it's too small might not consider the emotional weight. \n\nThe answer isn't straightforward, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because he stood up for his self-worth when his passion was mocked. But maybe others would argue the breakup was too harsh. However, given the context of his dedication and the personal nature of the attack, Answer B (not in the wrong) seems more justified.\n"
