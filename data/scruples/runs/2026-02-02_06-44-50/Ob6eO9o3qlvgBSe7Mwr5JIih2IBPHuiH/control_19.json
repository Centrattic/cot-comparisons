Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her comments about his sport. The situation is that she called trampolining not a real sport and dismissed his dedication. He was a high-level athlete for 12 years, and she made a comment that he took very personally, leading to the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has dedicated a significant amount of time and effort to his sport, which was a major part of his identity. His girlfriend's comments could be seen as belittling that effort and his achievements. That's a big deal because when someone's identity is tied to something they've worked hard on, criticism can feel like an attack on their self-worth.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's perspective might be that she was just making a joke or a light-hearted comment. Maybe she didn't realize how important trampolining was to him. People sometimes don't recognize the emotional weight others place on certain things. Her friends told the author he was being an asshole, which might suggest that the breakup was over a minor issue. But does that mean he's in the wrong?\n\nThe key factors here are intent and the depth of the relationship. If the girlfriend didn't mean to hurt him but her comment did, maybe the author overreacted. However, if the comment was dismissive and undermined his years of dedication, then the reaction is more understandable. The author felt like she was attacking who he is, which is a significant point. Relationships require respect for each other's values and identities. If one partner mocks something the other holds in high regard, that's a red flag.\n\nBut breaking up over one comment might be extreme. The author could have addressed it calmly, talked about how it made him feel, and given her a chance to explain or apologize. Instead, he broke up immediately. That might be seen as impulsive. However, if this was the culmination of past issues or if she had a history of not respecting his passion, then it's different.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. If the comment was a one-time thing and not malicious, then the breakup might be too harsh. But if the sport is central to his identity and she's dismissive, it's a deal-breaker for some people. The friends' opinions are divided, but friends might not always see the full context of the relationship dynamics.\n\nI think the author's reaction is justified if the sport is a core part of his identity and he felt disrespected. However, the immediate breakup without discussion could be seen as hasty. But considering the emotional impact, maybe it's not wrong. Alternatively, maybe he should have handled it differently. Hmm. It's tricky. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because his reaction was to a personal attack on his identity and years of dedication, which is significant. So, the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong) based on the context provided.\n"
