Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she mocked his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was a high-level national athlete in trampolining, dedicating 12 years and a lot of time and effort. He quit due to a head injury. They met after he stopped competing. She had played volleyball in high school. During a conversation about sports, she downplays trampolining, calling it not a real sport and implying it's easier than real sports like soccer. He dumps her immediately. Her friends say he's being an asshole over something small. He's hurt because the comment attacked his identity.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. Relationships require mutual respect and understanding. If someone's passion is mocked, especially when it's a significant part of their identity, that could be a deal-breaker. Trampolining being an Olympic sport might matter here. The girlfriend dismissed his achievements and effort, which could be seen as disrespectful. However, breaking up over one comment might be seen as overreacting. But if this comment hit a nerve about his self-worth and dedication, maybe not. The key factors are respect, the significance of the sport in his life, and the appropriateness of the breakup.\n\nSome might argue that taking it seriously is valid because it's his identity. Others might say a single joke isn't worth ending a relationship. But the comment wasn't just a joke; she questioned the legitimacy of his sport and his effort. That could be a serious issue. Also, considering they had known each other for a while (since he stopped competing), maybe she should have known how important it was to him. If she made that comment in a moment of flippancy without considering his feelings, that's a problem. So maybe he's justified. But others might think the breakup was too harsh. However, given the emotional impact and the disrespect shown, it's a gray area. The answer hinges on whether the comment was a legitimate disrespect or a minor misunderstanding. I think the author isn't in the wrong here because he stood up for his self-worth when it was attacked. So answer B (No).\n"
