Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a former high-level trampoline athlete who has dedicated 12 years to the sport. They were training a lot, competing nationally and internationally for Team Canada, and even received funding. They quit due to a head injury. Now, they met their girlfriend a few months after retiring. She used to play volleyball in high school on rep teams. \n\nDuring a conversation about sports, the author talks about being a top athlete and the dedication it takes. The girlfriend then says that trampolining isn't a real sport, comparing it to something like soccer where the author wouldn't have been as good. The author took this as a personal attack and dumped her on the spot. The friends of the girlfriend say the author is an asshole for breaking up over something small, but the author feels it's a big deal because the sport is a huge part of their identity.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. They mentioned they think the author is in the wrong but want my opinion. I need to decide between A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nFirst, let's think about the girlfriend's comment. She said trampolining isn't a real sport. That's a judgment about the sport itself, not necessarily the person. But the author is taking it as an attack on their identity. The girlfriend might not have intended to hurt the author, but maybe she was being dismissive of their hard work. However, people can have opinions without being malicious. \n\nTrampolining is often considered a niche sport, and some might question its legitimacy compared to more mainstream sports like soccer. But the author has proven dedication and success in it. The girlfriend's comparison to soccer could be her way of saying that soccer is more challenging, but that's subjective. \n\nThe key issue here is whether the comment was a minor thing that's not worth breaking up over. The author's reaction was immediate and decisive. Breaking up over a single conversation where the girlfriend made a dismissive comment about their sport could be seen as overreacting. Relationships require communication and understanding. If the author felt deeply hurt, maybe they should have discussed it first instead of ending the relationship abruptly. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's dedication to the sport is significant. The sport shaped their identity and they had real achievements. Feeling attacked about something that's a core part of their self-image is understandable. However, the girlfriend might not have realized the emotional weight the sport holds for the author. \n\nBut is this a deal-breaker? The author could have expressed their feelings and talked it out. Breaking up immediately without trying to resolve the issue might be hasty. The friends of the girlfriend think it's too small a reason, which suggests that the comment isn't as impactful as the author believes. \n\nAlternatively, if the girlfriend had a history of belittling things important to the author, this would be a bigger issue. But from the context, it's a single comment. The author might have taken it as a sign of deeper disrespect, but without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nIn relationships, respect is key. If one partner is constantly undermined, that's a problem. But a one-time comment may not be enough to justify a breakup unless there's a pattern or if it's a non-negotiable issue for the author. \n\nThe author's reaction seems extreme to an isolated incident. The comment was hurtful, but breaking up immediately without attempting to address it could be seen as the author overreacting. However, if the author felt that the comment represented a fundamental disrespect for their identity, they might have valid reasons. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the answer might depend on whether the comment was an isolated incident or part of a pattern. Since it's presented as a one-time thing, the author's reaction could be seen as disproportionate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not handling it with more communication and understanding. But if the comment was a deal-breaker for the author, then maybe not. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The friends said they're an asshole for breaking up over something small. That opinion comes from people who are close to the girlfriend, which might be biased. However, the situation does seem minor in the grand scheme of relationships. \n\nSo, likely, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they broke up over a minor comment without addressing it, which could have been resolved through discussion. The girlfriend's comment, while hurtful, doesn't seem to warrant an immediate breakup unless there's more to it.\n"
