Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up with a girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a national-level athlete, trained 30 hours a week, got funding, and then quit due to injury. His identity is tied to this sport. When discussing sports with his girlfriend, she dismissed trampolining as not a \"real\" sport, implying it's less valid than something like soccer. He felt attacked and dumped her immediately. Her friends said he overreacted.\n\nSo, the key points here: Is it reasonable to break up over this? Did she cross a line? The girlfriend's comments were dismissive and belittling, which hurt him. But others might say it's a small issue for a breakup. However, the author's sport is a huge part of his identity. Her comments undermined his years of dedication and achievements, which is a significant emotional trigger.\n\nI need to consider if the author's reaction is justified. The girlfriend made a judgment about the value of his sport, which can be seen as invalidating his hard work. People often have strong emotional attachments to their passions, and such a comment could feel like a personal attack. However, some might argue that breaking up over a one-time comment is extreme, especially if there's no history of similar issues.\n\nBut in the scenario, the author mentions that people (like her friends) told him he was an asshole for breaking up over something small. However, the author felt it was a personal attack on his identity. The girlfriend's friends might not have the full context of the years of dedication. The key here is whether her comment was a legitimate critique or an unnecessary dismissal. She said trampolining isn't a real sport, suggesting it's easier and less valid than soccer, which is a direct attack on his achievements.\n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's passions is important. If one partner belittles a significant part of the other's identity, that can be a deal-breaker. The author's reaction, while severe, might be seen as a defense of his self-worth in that moment. However, maybe there's room for discussion here\u2014did he give her a chance to explain or apologize before breaking up? The scenario says he dumped her on the spot. Maybe a better approach would have been to address the issue and see if she acknowledged his feelings. But if this was a recurring issue, then breaking up makes sense. The problem is the one-time comment, but the context of his deep investment in the sport matters.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's reaction is understandable given the personal significance of his sport. The girlfriend's comment was disrespectful. While the breakup might seem over-the-top to some, the emotional impact justifies his decision. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
