Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy broke up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining. He's been really into it for 12 years, trained a lot, competed nationally and internationally, even got funding. Then after he quit due to injury, he met this girlfriend. She thought it was cool at first, but during a conversation about sports, she said trampolining isn't a real sport, implied it's not hard to get good, and compared it to soccer where he wouldn't have been as good. He was so hurt that he dumped her right there.\n\nNow, the question is whether he was in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but I need to analyze. Let me break it down. First, the girlfriend's comments were clearly hurtful. She dismissed his dedication and achievements, which can be really offensive. But was it grounds for a breakup? The guy has every right to feel that his hard work is being belittled. Trampolining is recognized as a sport by the Olympics and other governing bodies, so her statement is factually incorrect. However, even if she was mistaken, the way she framed it as him not being good at a \"real\" sport like soccer could be seen as undermining his accomplishments. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy reacted immediately by breaking up. That might be a bit hasty. Relationships require communication and understanding. If this was a one-time comment and he didn't give her a chance to explain or apologize, maybe that's too quick. But if this was part of a pattern, or if the comment struck a nerve about his self-worth tied to his sport, then his reaction could be more justified. The girlfriend's friends called him an asshole, which suggests that they might think the issue was minor. But the author is saying that the sport is a huge part of his identity, and the comment felt like an attack on who he is. \n\nI need to consider if the breakup was a reasonable response to feeling disrespected. People have different sensitivities; for someone whose identity is closely tied to their sport, a dismissal like that can be devastating. The girlfriend's statement also implies that his achievements were easier to attain, which is a direct challenge to his effort and success. \n\nBut is it too much to base a breakup on? Some might argue that sports can be subjective in terms of \"realness,\" and that a relationship shouldn't be over because of a disagreement on that. However, if the comment made him feel devalued as a person, then it's about respect. The key here is whether the girlfriend's words were a genuine critique of the sport's status or a personal attack on his dedication. She mentioned that there's no one doing the sport, which might be a factual error, but the way she said it could be seen as minimizing his efforts. \n\nThe author might feel that the breakup was justified because the comment was not just about the sport but about his identity and the value of his hard work. Others might think that while the comment was hurtful, the immediate breakup is an overreaction. The friends' reaction could indicate they don't see the depth of the issue, but the author's perspective is that this was a major part of his life and being attacked for it was too much. \n\nIn the end, the answer might depend on the context of the relationship. If this was an isolated incident and there's no history of similar disrespect, maybe the breakup is a bit harsh. But if it's a dealbreaker for the author, then it's his choice. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The girlfriend's comment was disrespectful, so the author's reaction could be seen as defending his self-worth. But breaking up over a single argument is a significant action. It's possible that the author overreacted, but it's also possible that the comment was a catalyst for existing issues. \n\nI think the core issue is the girlfriend's lack of respect for his achievements and identity. The author isn't wrong to feel that deeply. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the breakup was a response to disrespect, which is a valid reason. However, others might argue that he should have addressed it first before breaking up. But given the emotional impact and the fact that it's a core part of his identity, it's a tough call. I'm leaning towards B, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me check again. The girlfriend made a personal attack, and the author felt it was a direct hit to his identity. If respect is a cornerstone of the relationship, then her statement was a problem. The author's reaction was immediate, but if it's a matter of principle, maybe it's okay. So the answer might be B.\n"
