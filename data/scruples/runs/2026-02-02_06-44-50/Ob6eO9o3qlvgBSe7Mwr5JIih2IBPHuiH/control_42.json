Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a guy who's been really dedicated to trampolining for 12 years, was a national-level athlete, and then he dumps his girlfriend because she called trampolining not a real sport. The girlfriend says that real sports like soccer would be harder, and he takes it as an attack on his identity. His friends say he's an asshole for breaking up over something small.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether the girlfriend's comment was a valid reason to break up. The guy obviously sees his sport as a huge part of his identity. Trampolining is an Olympic sport, so technically it's considered a real sport. But maybe she was using \"real sport\" in a different context, like more popular or mainstream. Maybe she meant that it's less competitive or less recognized. However, the guy points out that Canada has a competitive scene and he was training as hard as someone in a more traditional sport.\n\nThe girlfriend's friends say the guy is an asshole for breaking up over this. That might suggest that others see the reaction as disproportionate. But then again, if someone dismisses a significant part of your identity and achievements, that could be hurtful. The key here is whether the girlfriend's comment was a direct attack or just a light-hearted remark. The guy says she made fun of his sport, but maybe she was just joking or not considering his feelings.\n\nAlso, the guy's injury and the funding he received show that he was serious about the sport. If she downplays his dedication, that could be a red flag. But splitting up over one comment might be overreacting. Relationships require communication and understanding both sides. Maybe the guy should have addressed her comment and explained how it affected him instead of ending things immediately. However, if this was a recurring issue or if there was a pattern of belittling, then it might be justified.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might not have realized how deep this issue goes for him. It's possible she didn't mean to hurt him. But the fact that she said something like trampolining isn't a real sport could indicate a lack of respect for his dedication. The guy's reaction is extreme, but if it's about mutual respect, maybe he had a right to feel disrespected. However, breaking up over one argument, even a hurtful one, might be too hasty. \n\nI'm torn because the guy's feelings are valid, but the response could be seen as over the top. If the girlfriend's intentions were not malicious, then maybe he's overreacting. But if her comment was meant to belittle his achievements, then it's a justified break up. The friends' opinions are divided, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the comment was a one-time thing and not a pattern, then maybe the guy is wrong to break up. But if it's a dealbreaker for him, then it's his choice. However, the AITA (Am I the Asshole) context usually looks for whether the action was reasonable. So, breaking up over this might be seen as the author being the asshole because the comment, while hurtful, might not be a valid reason for such a drastic action.\n"
