Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, which is trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was a high-level trampoline athlete, dedicating a lot of time and effort to it. He quit due to an injury. His girlfriend made a comment about trampolining not being a \"real\" sport and implied that it's easier than real sports like soccer. The author felt attacked and dumped her immediately. Her friends say he's an asshole for overreacting.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but wants my opinion. The answer options are A (yes, he's wrong) or B (no, he's not wrong). \n\nLet me break this down. The key points are: 1) The girlfriend's comment was dismissive of his dedication and achievement. 2) The author felt deeply hurt and decided to end the relationship on the spot. 3) Friends and others think he overreacted.\n\nTrampolining is recognized as a sport, and the author's level of competition and funding suggest it's legitimate. The girlfriend's comment might be based on a misunderstanding or lack of awareness about the sport's demands. However, the author's reaction was immediate and severe. Breaking up over a single comment, even if it's hurtful, could be seen as extreme. Relationships require communication and resolving conflicts, not immediate termination. On the other hand, the comment did touch on his identity and accomplishments, which are significant to him. \n\nBut is it the author's fault? Well, the girlfriend's statement was disrespectful, but reacting by dumping her right then might be seen as not giving her a chance to explain or apologize. The author might be overreacting, but the comment did hit a sensitive nerve. However, the decision to end the relationship based on that one moment could be impulsive. \n\nIn similar situations, people often argue that if someone feels disrespected, they should address it through conversation rather than immediate breakup. So, from that angle, the author might be wrong. However, if the comment was a deal-breaker for him, then maybe not. The problem is that the girlfriend's friends think he's wrong, and the community might weigh in similarly. \n\nI think the main issue is whether a single comment is sufficient to justify ending a relationship. While the comment was hurtful, the response was extreme. So, leaning towards the author being in the wrong. But I need to make sure. Trampolining is indeed a sport, and her dismissal of it undermines his achievements. However, the reaction is still harsh. The balance here is between the validity of his feelings and the appropriateness of his response. \n\nAnother angle: in relationships, people have different tolerance levels for teasing or differing opinions. If this was a recurring issue, the breakup might make sense. But it was a one-time comment. The author didn't give her an opportunity to retract or apologize. So, the immediate breakup is a red flag for impulsive behavior. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
