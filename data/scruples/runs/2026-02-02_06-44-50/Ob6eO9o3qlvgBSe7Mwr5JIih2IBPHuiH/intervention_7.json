Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, competed nationally and internationally, got funding, and it was a huge part of his identity. He met his girlfriend after he stopped competing. She played volleyball, which he also thought was cool. When discussing sports, she called trampolining \"not a real sport,\" said it's not hard to get good at compared to real sports like soccer. The author felt attacked and broke up with her immediately. Now, her friends say he's an asshole, and he's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo the key points here: the author's dedication and identity tied to a niche sport. The girlfriend dismissed its legitimacy, comparing it to other sports. The breakup was immediate. \n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. Breaking up over a single conversation is a big decision. The author might feel that his passion and achievements were disrespected. Trampolining is an Olympic sport, so it's a real sport, but maybe the girlfriend was being dismissive in a way that didn't consider his feelings. However, does that justify ending the relationship? \n\nThe girlfriend's comment could be seen as a personal attack on his identity. If someone makes a comment that deeply hurts and undermines a significant part of your self-identity, is it unreasonable to end the relationship? But on the other hand, people may have different opinions on what constitutes a \"real sport,\" and maybe the girlfriend didn't mean to attack him personally. The author might have overreacted. \n\nSome factors to consider: How important is the sport to his identity? The girlfriend's intention\u2014was she trying to belittle him or just expressing her opinion? The fact that her friends said he's an asshole suggests that some people might think breaking up over this was too harsh. However, the author's emotional response is valid because the comment touched a sensitive part of his life. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Maybe he should have discussed his feelings about being respected for his sport rather than reacting with immediate breakup. But if the comment was a deal-breaker for him, then perhaps he's not wrong. It's a judgment call between respecting someone's passion and not overreacting to an opinion.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the breakup was the right decision. Some might say that a relationship shouldn't be ended over a single joke or opinion, especially if the girlfriend didn't mean to be malicious. Others might agree that if something is a core part of your identity and someone mocks it, that's a red flag. \n\nBut the author's reaction was immediate and not giving her a chance to explain. Maybe the girlfriend didn't realize how much it meant to him. The author could have expressed his hurt feelings and given her a chance to apologize instead of breaking up. So maybe he's in the wrong for not handling it more maturely. \n\nAlternatively, if he felt that her dismissal of his sport was a fundamental disrespect that he couldn't overlook, then breaking up isn't wrong. It's a matter of personal boundaries. So there's a balance here between respecting personal feelings and not overreacting to a single incident.\n"
