Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend after she made fun of their sport, trampolining. \n\nFirst, the user provided a detailed account where the boyfriend was a high-level national athlete in trampolining, dedicating years and significant time and effort. The girlfriend, who met him after he stopped competing, made a comment that trampolining isn't a real sport, implying it's less legitimate than others like soccer. The boyfriend felt this was an attack on his identity and achievements, leading him to break up immediately.\n\nNow, the key here is the appropriateness of the reaction. The girlfriend's comment was dismissive and belittling, which can be hurtful, especially when it's a core part of someone's identity. However, the question is whether the boyfriend's response was justified. \n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend's remark was disrespectful. She minimized his dedication and achievements, which is valid to feel upset about. The boyfriend's reaction was immediate and decisive, ending the relationship. But is that excessive? If someone's identity is attacked, taking it seriously and ending the relationship might be seen as justified if they felt it was a deal-breaker.\n\nOn the other hand, relationships require communication and understanding. The comment, while hurtful, could be addressed through discussion rather than immediate breakup. The friends' reactions suggesting he was an asshole might imply that others see the comment as minor, but that's subjective. The girlfriend's own sport, volleyball, might not have been as high-profile as soccer, but it's still a legitimate sport. Her comparison to soccer might be a flaw in her argument, but the core issue is her dismissal of his sport.\n\nSo, the key factors are: the girlfriend's comment was disrespectful, the boyfriend's reaction was immediate and final. Whether the reaction was proportionate depends on the value placed on mutual respect in a relationship. If the girlfriend's attitude reflects a lack of respect for his identity, ending the relationship could be a valid choice. However, some might argue that a breakup over one comment is extreme. \n\nIn many cases, the line between a valid and extreme reaction is subjective. The boyfriend's feelings are valid, especially if this was a recurring issue. But if it's a one-time comment and he immediately ended things without trying to discuss it, some might see that as hasty. However, if respecting each other's passions is a core value, then the reaction is justified.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer might hinge on whether the comment represents a deeper issue of disrespect. If it's an isolated incident, maybe the boyfriend overreacted. But if it's part of a pattern where his achievements aren't valued, then the breakup is justified. Since the story presents it as a one-time comment that hit a nerve, the boyfriend's reaction could be seen as a reasonable stand for self-respect, not in the wrong.\n"
