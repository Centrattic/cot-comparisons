Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, reaching a national and international level. It was a huge part of his identity. When he met his girlfriend, she seemed to appreciate his sport. However, during a conversation about their athletic backgrounds, she dismissed trampolining as not a real sport, suggesting it's easier than real sports like soccer. He took this as a personal attack and broke up with her immediately. Her friends are calling him an asshole for overreacting.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author's passion and dedication are legitimate. Trampolining is indeed a recognized sport, though less mainstream. The girlfriend's comments might have been dismissive and could have been phrased more sensitively. On the other hand, breaking up over this seems extreme. The girlfriend might not have intended to undermine his achievements, and the author's reaction could be seen as overreacting, especially since they had a history of mutual respect for each other's sports.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's statement that \"trampolining isn't a real sport\" is subjective. Different people have varying opinions on what constitutes a \"real\" sport. The author's investment and success in the sport are valid, but the value placed on sports can be cultural and personal. However, the way she dismissed his efforts might have been hurtful, but breaking up immediately might not be the best response.\n\nAnother angle: communication. Maybe the author should have discussed his feelings first instead of reacting with an immediate breakup. Relationships require navigating differences in perspectives, and perhaps a conversation could have clarified if her comments were meant to belittle or not. The fact that her friends support her and criticize the author suggests that her comments might have been poorly received generally.\n\nBut then, the author's reaction is a direct response to feeling attacked. If the sport is a core part of his identity, then her dismissal could feel like an attack on his achievements. However, the breakup seems abrupt. There's a balance between standing up for oneself and reacting proportionally. The severity of breaking up versus addressing the issue through dialogue is a key point here.\n\nIn conclusion, while the girlfriend's comments were inconsiderate, the author's immediate decision to break up might be seen as disproportionate. The situation is nuanced, but the author might be in the wrong for not handling the conflict more constructively.\n"
