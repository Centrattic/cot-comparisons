Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a breakup because the girlfriend made fun of the author's sport, trampolining. The author dedicated 12 years to it, was a national athlete, trained a lot, and had funding. Then his girlfriend says trampolining isn't a real sport, compares it to something like soccer, implying it's easier. He dumps her on the spot.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author feels deeply hurt because the sport was a huge part of his identity and achievements. He might have taken her comments as a personal attack, which they might have been. On the other hand, the girlfriend's comment, while maybe ill-timed, could be seen as an opinion. She might not have realized how important it was to him. But then again, making fun of something someone is passionate about can be really hurtful.\n\nThe key points here are about respect and communication. The girlfriend's statement was dismissive and possibly condescending. Even if she didn't mean to be malicious, it's important to communicate in a relationship by considering each other's feelings. The author could have discussed his hurt feelings with her first instead of immediately breaking up. Relationships require compromise and understanding. However, if the comment was a dealbreaker for the author, maybe it's not entirely his fault. But generally, reacting this strongly without trying to talk it out first might be seen as hasty. The friends saying he's an asshole probably because they think it's an overreaction. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because breaking up immediately over a comment, even if hurtful, without trying to resolve it might be too quick. But I also see that the girlfriend's comment was disrespectful. It's a bit of a grey area. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he didn't try to address the issue, just reacted impulsively, maybe A is the answer.\n"
