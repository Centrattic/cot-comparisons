Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about breaking up because the girlfriend called his sport, trampolining, not a real sport. The user is asking if he's an a**hole for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a national-level athlete, trained 30 hours a week, got funding, and it was a huge part of his identity. The breakup happened when she said trampolining isn't a real sport and implied that he wouldn't be good at a real sport like soccer. He felt attacked because his identity was tied to his sport. \n\nOn the other hand, his girlfriend's comment might have been a joke or a light-hearted jab, but he took it seriously. She played volleyball in high school, which he found cool. Maybe she was trying to compare her own experience to his, not necessarily invalidating his achievements. However, her statement that trampolining isn't a real sport is dismissive of his dedication and accomplishments, which is a sensitive area for him.\n\nThe key points are the emotional impact of her words on him and whether her comment was justified. Trampolining is recognized as a sport by the Olympics, so it's a real sport. Her dismissal of it shows a lack of respect for his hard work. He felt attacked, which is valid given the personal connection. Breaking up over this might be extreme, but if it's a matter of respect for his identity, maybe it's understandable. \n\nBut some might argue that taking offense to a joke or a casual comment is overreacting. However, the fact that she compared his sport negatively while he took it as an attack on his identity complicates things. The friends' reactions say he's an a**hole, but maybe they don't understand the depth of his feelings. The question is whether the breakup was justified. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, if her comment was disrespectful and he felt it undermined his identity, he's not entirely wrong. But breaking up over something that could be seen as a joke might be too harsh. However, if the issue is about mutual respect in a relationship, her comment was disrespectful, and his reaction is a matter of personal boundaries. So, maybe he's not in the wrong. But others might say he overreacted. The answer depends on whether the comment was a legitimate disrespect or a minor joke taken the wrong way.\n"
