Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up with a girlfriend because she mocked his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a high-level athlete, trained hard, got national/international recognition, and quit due to injury. The girlfriend made fun of trampolining, saying it's not a real sport and that others could be better in \"real\" sports. The author broke up immediately, and her friends think he's an asshole. He's wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nI should consider both sides. On one hand, the author's sport is significant to his identity. Being dismissed like that could feel like a personal attack. On the other hand, breaking up over a comment, even if hurtful, might be seen as overreacting. The girlfriend's friends think it's too much, and maybe the comment was a joke or not meant to be taken seriously. But for the author, it's a deep issue of respect for his lifelong dedication.\n\nThe key points: Was the comment valid? Trampolining is an Olympic sport, so it's recognized. The girlfriend's argument that others could be better in \"real\" sports is subjective. The author felt attacked because the sport is a major part of his identity. \n\nBut is breaking up over this justified? Some might say yes because it's about respect for the person's achievements. Others might say no, as it's a single comment and not a deal-breaker. The author's reaction is immediate\u2014did he give her a chance to explain or apologize? Also, the girlfriend's friends' opinion might indicate that her comment was out of line, but the author's response might be too harsh. \n\nConsidering AITA standards, people often aren't in the wrong if they stand up for their values, but overreacting can be seen as the issue. The comment was disrespectful, but the reaction was extreme. However, if the comment crossed a line into invalidating his identity, maybe the reaction is justified. It's a tricky balance. The answer likely depends on whether the comment was a one-time joke versus a pattern of disrespect. Since it's a one-time incident, the breakup might be excessive. So, leaning towards the author being in the wrong (A).\n"
