Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves breaking up a girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a national athlete, got funding, and had a head injury leading to quitting. Meeting the girlfriend after his career. They discussed sports, and she dismissed trampolining as not a \"real sport,\" comparing it to soccer. He broke up immediately. Her friends say he's an asshole overreacting. He's conflicted because he feels she attacked his identity.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break down both sides.\n\nThe author's perspective: Trampolining was a huge part of his identity. He invested a lot of time and effort. When someone he cares about dismisses his passion, it's a personal attack. He might feel that his dedication is undervalued. Breaking up could be a reaction to feeling disrespected, especially if this is a recurring issue or a culmination of feelings.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective: She made a comment about trampolining not being a real sport. Maybe she didn't mean to be dismissive, just a joke or a light-hearted comment. She has her own sport background (volleyball), but perhaps she didn't realize the depth of his feelings about it. Her friends don't support his decision, suggesting she might not have intended to hurt him.\n\nFactors to consider: Was the comment a one-time joke or part of a pattern? If it's the first time and she didn't realize the impact, maybe he overreacted. But if this is about respecting someone's dedication, maybe he's right to take it seriously. Also, the emotional investment in the sport is significant. The line between standing up for oneself and overreacting can be thin here.\n\nTrampolining is an Olympic sport, so technically it's recognized. But some people might not see it as \"real\" compared to more mainstream sports. The girlfriend's comparison to soccer could imply that she thinks soccer is harder, which the author disagrees with. \n\nThe key issue is whether the author's reaction was proportionate. Breaking up over a single comment might be extreme, but if it's a deal-breaker for their values, maybe not. The friends think he's wrong because it's a small issue, but to him, it's a big deal because it's about respect for his identity.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the action was a reasonable response to disrespect. If she disrespected his passion, which is central to his identity, then standing up for himself is valid. However, breaking up immediately might be seen as impulsive unless there was prior tension. The girlfriend might not have intended to devalue his efforts, so he could have addressed it with a conversation first.\n\nBut considering the emotional impact, the author might not be in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the comment was a legitimate disrespect, which it was, and whether the response was justified. The friends' opinions are mixed, but the community might side with the author if the comment was hurtful and a reflection of deeper issues in the relationship.\n"
