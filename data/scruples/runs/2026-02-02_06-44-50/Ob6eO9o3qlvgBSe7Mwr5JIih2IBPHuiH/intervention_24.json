Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person (let's call them A) had a girlfriend who made fun of their sport, trampolining, and A dumped her because of that. The question is whether A was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. A dedicated 12 years to trampolining, trained a lot, competed nationally and internationally, even got funding. That's a huge commitment. Trampolining isn't as popular as sports like soccer, so maybe people don't see it as \"real\" because it's less mainstream. The girlfriend, who plays volleyball, says trampolining isn't a real sport, implying it's easier to get good at. A took that as a personal attack on their identity and achievements, hence the breakup.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's comments could be seen as dismissive and disrespectful. Trampolining is an Olympic sport, so it's recognized as real. A's dedication and achievements are valid. But maybe the girlfriend didn't mean to be cruel, maybe she was just making a joke or being ignorant. However, A felt deeply hurt, which makes sense given how much the sport meant to them.\n\nBut is breaking up over that justified? Relationships require communication and understanding. If the girlfriend didn't respect a core part of A's identity, that could be a dealbreaker. However, responding with a breakup immediately might be seen as overreacting. The girlfriend's friends said A was an asshole, suggesting that maybe others think the reaction was too harsh. But A's feelings are valid; their identity and years of effort were attacked.\n\nSo, is A in the wrong? If the girlfriend's comment was a one-time thing and A ended the relationship without addressing it, maybe. But if the comment was a dealbreaker and A felt disrespected, then it's not necessarily wrong. However, the question is whether A is in the wrong. The key factors are: the validity of the girlfriend's comment (trampolining being a real sport), the depth of A's commitment, and the appropriateness of the reaction.\n\nI think the girlfriend's comment was disrespectful, especially given A's background. But reacting by breaking up immediately might not be the healthiest approach. The right thing would be to discuss the issue, see if the girlfriend can understand or apologize. If the girlfriend was unaware of the sport's legitimacy and A's dedication, maybe the breakup was too quick. However, if the comment was a reflection of deeper issues or lack of respect, then maybe it was justified. \n\nSo, the answer might be that A is not in the wrong (B), because the girlfriend's comment was a direct attack on a significant part of A's identity. But others might argue A overreacted. But given the context, the emotional impact is valid. So I'm leaning towards B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
