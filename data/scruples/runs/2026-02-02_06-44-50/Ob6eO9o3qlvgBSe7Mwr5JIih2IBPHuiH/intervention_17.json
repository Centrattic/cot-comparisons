Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did the right thing by breaking up with their girlfriend because she made fun of trampolining as not being a \"real\" sport. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, competed nationally and internationally, and got funding. That's a significant amount of time and effort. The girlfriend, on the other hand, played volleyball in high school. When discussing sports, she downplays trampolining, saying it's not a real sport and that it's easy compared to something like soccer. \n\nThe author feels that this comment was an attack on who they are, given the time and dedication they put into their sport. The girlfriend's friends say the author is an asshole for breaking up over this, implying that the issue is minor. But to the author, it's a major deal because it's tied to their identity and self-worth.\n\nNow, is the author wrong? Well, relationships require mutual respect. If one partner trivializes the other's achievements or passions, that's a red flag. The girlfriend's comment wasn't just a joke; she was dismissing a significant part of the author's life. While breaking up might seem over the top to some, the author's reaction is rooted in feeling disrespected. \n\nOn the flip side, maybe the author should have addressed the issue first instead of immediately breaking up. But given the emotional impact, it's possible the author felt they couldn't overlook that disrespect. \n\nIn terms of societal views, some might see the author as oversensitive, but others would agree that respecting each other's passions is crucial. The girlfriend's friends might not get why it's a big deal, but they weren't the ones dedicating 30 hours a week for years. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, if the issue is about the breakup itself, maybe not. The girlfriend's comment was disrespectful. The author had a right to feel attacked. However, the immediate decision to break up without trying to discuss it might be seen as extreme. But considering the context, the author's feelings are valid. \n\nI think the answer here is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). The girlfriend's comment was dismissive of a major part of the author's identity, and the author had every right to feel that it undermined their hard work and achievements. While the timing and method of the breakup could be questioned, the core issue of respecting the author's dedication seems valid.\n"
