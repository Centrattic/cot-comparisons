Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong after breaking up with his girlfriend over her comments about his sport.\n\nFirst, the author was a top-level trampoline athlete, dedicating 30 hours a week for years. He got funding, competed nationally and internationally. Then he stopped due to injury. He met his girlfriend after that. She heard about his sport and seemed to think it was cool. When discussing sports, she says trampolining isn't a real sport, mentions it's not hard compared to something like soccer, and implies he wouldn't have been good at a real sport. He dumps her immediately.\n\nThe girlfriend's friends say he's an asshole for breaking up over something small. The user thinks he's in the wrong but is unsure. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points: The author took his sport very seriously, which was a huge part of his identity. The girlfriend made a derogatory comment about his sport, which he perceived as a personal attack. He ended the relationship instantly. The friends and some people might think this is overreacting. But others might see it as a justified stand on respecting one's personal achievements and values.\n\nTrampolining is an Olympic sport, so calling it not a real sport is factually incorrect. The girlfriend's comments could be seen as dismissive of his hard work and dedication. The author's reaction might be a way of defending his identity and the value of his efforts. However, breaking up over one conversation could be seen as extreme, especially if there's no prior history of similar issues. The question is whether the comment was a valid reason to end a relationship.\n\nOn one hand, defending personal achievements is important. On the other, relationships require communication and conflict resolution. If this was the first time she made such a comment, it's a big deal for him, but if there were previous issues, maybe not. The story doesn't mention prior problems, so the assumption is that this one incident was the breaking point. The friends' reactions suggest they think it's too harsh, but the author felt deeply hurt.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. However, in relationship dynamics, the appropriateness of the response matters. If the comment was a one-off and not a recurring issue, ending the relationship might be excessive. However, if the comment reflects a deeper lack of respect for his values and history, it could be a dealbreaker. The author's reaction is valid in that he's standing up for himself, but the timing and method (immediate breakup) could be questioned. \n\nThe key factors are the severity of the comment (dismissing a significant part of his identity), the context (first time this happened), and the relationship's overall health. Since the story doesn't indicate prior issues, the author's decision to leave might be seen as a justified stand for self-respect. Alternatively, it could be seen as overreacting without giving the girlfriend a chance to address or apologize. \n\nGiven that the girlfriend's statement was factually incorrect and disrespectful, and the sport was central to the author's identity, the reaction might not be unreasonable. However, the immediate breakup without discussion might not allow for resolution. But if the author felt it was a fundamental disrespect that couldn't be reconciled, it's his right to end the relationship. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer depends on whether the response is proportionate. The author is not in the wrong because he's protecting his self-worth, but others might see it as too harsh. The key is that the girlfriend's comment was a direct attack on his core identity, which can be a valid reason to end a relationship.\n"
