Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a high-level athlete, and even got funding. His sport is something he's very proud of. After his career ended due to injury, he met his girlfriend. She played volleyball but not at a top level. During a conversation about sports, she dismissed trampolining as not a \"real sport,\" implying it's less valid than others like soccer, and said he wouldn't have been good at a real sport. He took this as a personal attack and broke up with her immediately. Her friends think he's an asshole for overreacting.\n\nNow, the key points here are the validity of his reaction and whether the breakup was justified. The author feels that his dedication and achievements were belittled. She made a comment that could be seen as devaluing his hard work and identity. However, others argue it's an overreaction because the comment might not have been intended to attack, or maybe it was a joke. Also, the fact that her friends called him an asshole suggests some people think the breakup was too harsh.\n\nI should consider if the comment was a legitimate criticism or a personal attack. Dismissing someone's passion as not a \"real\" sport can be hurtful, especially if that sport is a significant part of their identity. The author's reaction was immediate, which might indicate that the comment crossed a line he wasn't willing to tolerate. On the other hand, the girlfriend's friends might not see the issue, thinking it's a minor disagreement.\n\nAnother angle: communication. Did the author and girlfriend have prior discussions about their views on sports? If not, maybe the author didn't set boundaries about how his sport should be treated. Also, the girlfriend's comment could have been a moment of jealousy or insecurity, but that's speculative.\n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, if one partner's core aspects are consistently disrespected, it can be a deal-breaker. The author might feel that respecting his achievements is essential, and the comment undermined that. However, breaking up over a single comment might seem extreme to some, especially if there's a history of mutual respect otherwise.\n\nBut the AITA forum often looks at whether the action was proportionate. The author took a significant step (breaking up) over a specific comment. While the comment was hurtful, others might argue that a breakup is too severe. However, if that comment represented a recurring issue or a fundamental disrespect, it's more understandable.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the context. If the girlfriend's comment was a one-time thing and there's no history of disrespect, then breaking up might be seen as disproportionate. However, if the comment struck at the core of the author's identity and was a deal-breaker, it's justified. The answer isn't black and white, but based on the information given, the author might not be in the wrong if the comment was deeply offensive and the relationship had built-up issues.\n"
