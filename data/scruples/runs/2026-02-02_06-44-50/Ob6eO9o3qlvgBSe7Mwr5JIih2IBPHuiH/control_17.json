Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person broke up with their girlfriend because she made fun of their sport, trampolining. The user is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author dedicated 12 years to a high-level sport, which is significant. They were part of national and international competitions, got funding, and it was a huge part of their identity. Then, the girlfriend dismissed trampolining as not a real sport, saying it's not hard to reach a high level compared to something like soccer. The author took this as an attack on their identity and effort, leading to the breakup.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's comment might come across as dismissive or belittling, even if she didn't mean it that way. She might have been trying to make a joke or not realizing how much the sport meant to him. But the way she framed it\u2014saying it's not a real sport and that he wouldn't be good at a \"real\" sport like soccer\u2014could be seen as invalidating his achievements.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. Breaking up over a comment like that might seem harsh to some. The friends of the girlfriend said the author is an asshole for making it about something so small. But the key factor here is how personal and significant the sport was to the author. If the comment made the author feel disrespected or attacked their identity, then their reaction might be understandable from their perspective. However, others might argue that the girlfriend's comment, while hurtful, wasn't worth ending a relationship over. It's possible that the author overreacted, especially if the girlfriend didn't intend to be so harsh. The question is whether the offense taken was justified given the context.\n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. If the author had expressed how much the sport meant to them and the impact of the comment, maybe they could have worked through it. But the fact that the girlfriend made a direct comparison to a more mainstream sport and dismissed the effort involved could have been the breaking point. It's a balance between respecting someone's passions and not overreacting to a potentially flippant comment.\n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the author's reaction was proportionate. If the comment was a direct attack on their identity and achievements, then the author might not be in the wrong. However, if the girlfriend's comment was a minor or unintentional jab that didn't fully understand the context of the author's dedication, then the author might be overreacting. The friends' reactions suggest that others see the breakup as too severe, but the author's deep connection to trampolining is a significant aspect. This is a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the comment was personal and invalidated their hard work. However, others might still see the breakup as disproportionate.\n"
