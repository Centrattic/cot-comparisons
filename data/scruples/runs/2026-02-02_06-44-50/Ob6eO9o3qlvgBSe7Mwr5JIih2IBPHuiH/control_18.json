Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for breaking up their girlfriend over her comments about trampolining not being a real sport.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a national athlete, got funding, and had a serious injury. Their girlfriend, after discussing sports, made a comment that trampolining isn't a real sport and that it's easier than something like soccer. The author took offense and broke up immediately. Friends say the author is an asshole for overreacting.\n\nSo, the key points here are the emotional impact of the comment on the author and the girlfriend's intention. The author saw the comment as an attack on their identity and dedication. Trampolining is a recognized sport, even if it's less popular. The girlfriend's remark might stem from a lack of awareness or a dismissive attitude towards niche sports.\n\nI need to consider if the breakup was disproportionate. The author's reaction was immediate, which suggests that the comment hit a nerve. The dedication and sacrifice involved in their athletic career are significant. To the author, the comment wasn't just about the sport but about their identity and achievements.\n\nHowever, from the girlfriend's perspective, maybe she didn't mean to devalue his efforts. People often make offhand comments without considering the emotional weight. But in relationships, how you handle such comments is important. The author's response was to end the relationship, which might be seen as extreme. But if the comment was a dealbreaker because it represented disrespect towards a core part of the author's identity, maybe it's justified.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author overreacted. The girlfriend's friends think so. The question is whether the comment was a legitimate reason to break up. It's a matter of perspective. The author felt it was an attack, while others might see it as a trivial disagreement.\n\nIn terms of social norms, relationships can have disagreements over values and respect. If one person's core values are consistently disrespected, it's a valid reason to end the relationship. The author might feel that the comment reflected a fundamental disrespect for their identity. However, the suddenness and the nature of the comment could be seen as a miscommunication rather than a malicious attack.\n\nSo, balancing these factors: the author's dedication, the emotional trigger, and the girlfriend's possible intent. The answer hinges on whether the reaction was proportionate. The author might not be in the wrong if they felt disrespected in a significant way. However, the decision to break up immediately without discussing or understanding the girlfriend's perspective could be seen as hasty. But given the context of the comment impacting their self-worth, it's a tough call.\n\nIn the end, the community might split. Some see it as a valid reason to protect self-esteem, others as overreaction. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer would likely be B (No), since the author was defending their identity after a hurtful comment, even if the method was abrupt. The girlfriend's friends might not understand the emotional impact, but the author has a justification based on their personal values and history.\n"
