Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong after dumping his girlfriend because she called trampolining not a real sport. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was a high-level trampoline athlete for Canada, dedicated 12 years, trained a lot, and even got funding. Then he meets his girlfriend after he quits competing. She had heard about his sport and thought it was cool. They were discussing sports, and she said trampolining isn't a real sport because it's not popular and not as hard as, say, soccer. He took it really personally and broke up with her immediately. His friends say he's an asshole for that.\n\nSo the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nIs it reasonable to break up over a comment about a sport's validity? Trampolining is an Olympic sport, so technically it is a recognized sport. The girlfriend's comment might be seen as dismissive. The author's reaction is extreme\u2014ending the relationship immediately. However, maybe the comment struck a nerve because his identity was tied to his sport. \n\nBut is it fair to end a relationship over a single, hurtful comment? Relationships require communication and understanding. If this was a one-time joke and not a recurring issue, maybe the reaction is too harsh. On the other hand, if the comment invalidated his years of dedication, it's understandable he was hurt. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's statement that trampolining isn't as hard as soccer could be seen as minimizing his achievements. The author might feel that his sacrifices were not respected. However, breaking up immediately might be an overreaction, even if the comment was hurtful. \n\nLooking at the girlfriend's perspective: she might not have meant to be malicious, just expressing an opinion. But opinions can still be hurtful when they devalue someone's identity. \n\nThe friends said he's an asshole for breaking up over \"something so small.\" Whether the comment is small or not depends on the emotional impact. The author felt attacked, which is a big deal. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the decision to break up is a personal one. But if the relationship can be salvaged with communication, maybe the author didn't have to break up. However, if the girlfriend's comment was inconsiderate and disrespectful, then the author's reaction might be justified. \n\nI think it's a bit of both. The girlfriend's comment was dismissive and hurtful, but the immediate breakup is extreme. The author should have expressed his feelings and maybe discussed it instead of ending things right then. So maybe he's not entirely in the wrong, but his reaction was extreme. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the girlfriend made a judgmental comment about his identity and he felt attacked, it's a sensitive issue. The answer might lean towards B (he's not in the wrong) because her comment was disrespectful, but others might argue the breakup was too hasty. \n\nI need to decide between A and B. If the comment was a significant disrespect to his identity, then B is correct. But if the breakup was an overreaction, then A. The key is whether the action was proportional. Ending a relationship over one comment might be too much, even if it's hurtful. So maybe A, but I'm a bit torn. Alternatively, if the comment was a deal-breaker because it showed her lack of respect, then B. \n\nIn the end, the author's dedication and the girlfriend's dismissal of his achievements could justify the breakup, so B (not in the wrong).\n"
