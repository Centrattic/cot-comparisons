Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining. I need to evaluate the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a national athlete, trained 30 hours a week, and even got funding. His injury ended his career. He met his girlfriend after that, and she knew about his sport. When discussing sports, she dismissed trampolining as not a real sport, saying there are few people in it and it's easy compared to others. He took it as an attack on his identity and effort, leading him to break up.\n\nThe main issue is whether her comment was dismissive and if the author's reaction was justified. She said \"trampolining isn't a real sport\" and implied it's easier than others. That's subjective, but she undermined his dedication. However, the question is if the author is in the wrong for breaking up over this.\n\nArguments for the author being in the wrong: Breaking up over a single comment might be hasty. Dismissing someone's passion can be hurtful, but maybe there's a line between a joke and an insult. If this was a pattern, but it seems like a one-time conversation.\n\nArguments against: The author's sport was central to his identity. Her comment attacked his significant life achievements. He felt it was a personal attack, which is valid. The girlfriend's friends called him an asshole, but they might not know the full context.\n\nThe author's reaction was immediate, but trampolining is a recognized sport, albeit less popular. The girlfriend's comparison to soccer might be a bias towards more mainstream sports. However, the author's dedication is real. The breakup was immediate, which could be seen as overreacting, but if it's about respect for one's identity, it's understandable.\n\nIn some cases, breaking up over a core value or disrespect is justified. If the girlfriend consistently devalued his passions, it's a red flag. Since it was a single incident, maybe the author overreacted, but if it's about respect, perhaps not. The key is whether the comment was a deal-breaker. The author felt it was, so he's defending his right to end the relationship because of disrespect towards a significant part of himself.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might not be in the wrong because the comment attacked his identity. However, some might argue that breaking up over a single joke is too extreme. The answer is likely B (No, not in the wrong) because the comment was disrespectful to his dedication, and ending the relationship over a core value is understandable.\n"
