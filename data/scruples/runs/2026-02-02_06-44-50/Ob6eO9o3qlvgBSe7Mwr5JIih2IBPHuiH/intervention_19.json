Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining. The author was a high-level national athlete in trampolining, dedicating 12 years of his life to it, training nearly 30 hours a week while in high school. He got funding and was proud of his achievements. Now, after he stopped competing, the girlfriend made a comment during a conversation that trampolining isn't a real sport, implying it's less serious than something like soccer. The author then dumped her immediately.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but wants my opinion. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's sport is a significant part of his identity. He dedicated a lot of time and effort, and it's not just a hobby. The girlfriend, on the other hand, plays volleyball but at a recreational level. She might not have fully appreciated the dedication required for trampolining, maybe seeing it as less legitimate. The comment she made was hurtful to him, attacking his past achievements. The author felt that his identity was being undermined, so he ended the relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, people can have different opinions on what constitutes a \"real\" sport. Some might argue that all sports are valid, but others might have biases towards more popular ones. The girlfriend's friends say the author is an asshole for breaking up over something small, which suggests they don't see the comment as a major issue. However, the author's reaction was immediate and severe. \n\nI should think about whether the comment was a deal-breaker. The author's sport was a major part of his life, so if a partner disrespects that, it might be a red flag. But maybe the girlfriend didn't realize how important it was to him. Was the breakup justified? Some might say that if she was dismissive of his hard work, then the author is right to leave. Others might say that one comment isn't a big enough reason to end a relationship. \n\nThe key points are the dedication and significance of the sport to the author's identity, and the girlfriend's belittling comment. If the comment was a genuine misunderstanding and the author could have explained it, then the reaction might be too harsh. But if the girlfriend's attitude reflects a deeper disrespect for his efforts, then the breakup makes sense. \n\nI need to decide if the author overreacted. The girlfriend said trampolining isn't a real sport, and that he wouldn't have been good at \"real\" sports like soccer. That's a direct put-down. The author's response was immediate, which could be seen as impulsive. However, if he had built up frustration from past comments, maybe it was a culmination. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers the level of immaturity or if the person's reaction is disproportionate. The author's dedication is clear, but so is the girlfriend's dismissive attitude. Breaking up because of a core part of someone's identity being denigrated might be justified. On the flip side, some might argue that couples should work through such issues rather than end the relationship so quickly. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the comment was an isolated incident or part of a pattern. If it's the first time, maybe the author could have addressed it more calmly. But given the depth of the issue, if the girlfriend fundamentally didn't respect his passion, then the breakup is understandable. The friends' reactions might be dismissive because they don't see the significance of the sport, but the author does. \n\nSo, the author's right to feel attacked is valid. If someone is being disrespected about a major part of their identity, it's a big deal. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, if the breakup was too hasty without giving her a chance to explain or apologize, then maybe A. But in the story, he said it was \"on the spot,\" which is immediate. \n\nThe community often looks at intent and impact. Even if the girlfriend didn't mean to be malicious, the impact on the author was significant. So, the answer might lean towards B, as the author has a right to protect his self-worth in the relationship. The friends might not get it because they don't value the sport, but the author does. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship over something that deeply affects his sense of self.\n"
