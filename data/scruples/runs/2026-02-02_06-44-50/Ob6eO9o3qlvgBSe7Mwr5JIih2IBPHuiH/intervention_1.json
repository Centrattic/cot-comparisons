Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the situation is about whether the person who broke up with their girlfriend over her comments about trampolining being a \"real\" sport is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author dedicated a lot of time and effort to trampolining, which is a significant part of their identity. They were a national-level athlete, trained a lot, got funding, and then had to quit due to injury. The girlfriend made a comment saying trampolining isn't a real sport because it's not as popular or hard as something like soccer. The author took this as an attack on their identity and effort, leading to the breakup.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to hear my take. Let me break it down.\n\nThe girlfriend's comment: She said trampolining isn't a real sport and implied that the author wouldn't have been good at a more mainstream sport. That's pretty dismissive. For someone who's invested so much into their sport, this could feel like a personal attack. But maybe the girlfriend didn't realize the depth of the author's commitment. She might have been being flippant or not thinking about how it would hurt him.\n\nOn the other hand, the author responded by breaking up immediately. Is that an overreaction? Relationships require communication. Maybe he should have talked to her about how he felt instead of ending things right there. However, if the comment hit a nerve because of his past dedication, it's not unreasonable for him to feel hurt and decide that compatibility is an issue.\n\nThe girlfriend's friends said the author is an asshole for breaking up over such a small thing. But what's small to one person might be significant to another. The key is whether the girlfriend's comment was a one-time thing or part of a pattern. If it's a single incident, maybe the author overreacted. But if she regularly minimizes his achievements or belittles things he cares about, that's a bigger issue.\n\nAlso, trampolining is an Olympic sport, so it's a real sport. Her dismissal might stem from a lack of awareness or a bias towards more popular sports. The author's reaction is about feeling disrespected. The question is whether the reaction was proportional. Dumping someone over a comment like that might be too harsh if they can't work through it, but if it's a dealbreaker for the author, then maybe not.\n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's passions is important. If the girlfriend doesn't value something that's a core part of the author's identity, that's a problem. But maybe the author could have addressed the comment calmly, explaining why it hurt. Breaking up immediately might prevent resolving the issue.\n\nSo weighing it, the author might be in the right if the comment was a dealbreaker and indicative of deeper issues. However, the sudden breakup without discussion could be seen as extreme. But given the depth of the author's investment in the sport, maybe it's understandable. The friends' reactions might be influenced by not knowing the full context of the author's dedication.\n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the girlfriend's comment was dismissive of his significant achievements and identity. If she can't respect that, maybe the relationship isn't compatible. But it's a close call. The answer is probably B (not in the wrong).\n"
