Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person who posted this is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend because she called trampolining not a real sport. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, trained a lot, competed nationally and internationally, and even got funding. Then, after quitting due to injury, they met their girlfriend. She had some sports background in volleyball. During a conversation about sports, she made a comment that trampolining isn't a real sport and implied it's easier than other sports like soccer. The author took this as an attack on their identity and dedication, leading to an immediate breakup. Friends told the author they were an asshole for making a big deal out of it.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the girlfriend's comment was dismissive of a sport the author deeply values. The author felt it was a personal attack because of their long-term commitment. The girlfriend's friends think the breakup was too harsh.\n\nNow, considering both sides. From the author's perspective, their passion and identity are tied to trampolining. Being told it's not a \"real\" sport might feel like invalidating their hard work. But from the girlfriend's side, maybe she was just making a joke or a casual remark without realizing the depth of the author's feelings. People often have different views on what constitutes a \"real\" sport, and her comment might not have been intended to hurt. However, the author's reaction seems extreme\u2014ending the relationship over one conversation. But maybe the comment struck a nerve because it's a recurring issue the author has faced.\n\nThe challenge here is whether the author overreacted. The girlfriend's statement was dismissive, but breaking up immediately might not be the healthiest response. However, the author might feel that their core identity was attacked. It's a balance between respecting personal values and the proportionality of the response.\n\nIn some cases, a comment like that could be a deal-breaker if it's about mutual respect. But the girlfriend might not have realized the author's sensitivity. The author could have used the moment to explain their feelings instead of ending things. On the other hand, if the girlfriend showed a pattern of belittling, then the author's reaction might make sense. But here, it's a single instance. The friends' reactions suggest they see the author as overreacting, but maybe they don't understand the emotional impact.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because the response was extreme, but there's also context where their feelings were deeply hurt. However, the breakup over a single comment without trying to address it might be seen as disproportionate. Alternatively, if this was part of a larger pattern, but the story doesn't indicate that. The answer hinges on whether the author's reaction was justified given their personal history and the girlfriend's intent.\n"
