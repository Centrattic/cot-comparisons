Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The guy has dedicated a significant part of his life to trampolining, reaching a high level, and it's a big part of his identity. His girlfriend, who played volleyball, later comments that trampolining isn't a real sport, implying it's less legitimate than other sports like soccer. The guy takes this as a personal attack and dumps her immediately. \n\nNow, considering the context: The girlfriend's statement could be seen as dismissive of his hard work and achievements. The guy felt it was an attack on who he is. On the other hand, some might argue that breaking up over a comment like that is overreacting, especially since the girlfriend had a history of making such remarks. But others might say that if the comment deeply hurt his sense of self, then the reaction is justified.\n\nI should consider cultural attitudes toward different sports. Trampolining might not be as widely recognized as soccer or volleyball, so the girlfriend's comment could stem from a lack of awareness rather than malice. However, the guy's dedication and the sacrifices he made are significant. The fact that she compared it to soccer, which he wasn't good at, could add to the sting.\n\nAlso, the friends' reactions are split, with some calling him an asshole. But personal values and the importance of mutual respect in a relationship matter. If one partner's achievements are undervalued by the other, that's a red flag. The guy might have felt it was a deal-breaker because it reflected a lack of respect for his identity.\n\nIn conclusion, while some might think breaking up was too harsh, others would agree that it's valid if his self-worth is tied to his sport and he felt disrespected. It's a nuanced situation, but the key is whether the comment was a deal-breaker for him. The answer might hinge on the significance of the sport to his identity and the context of their relationship.\n"
