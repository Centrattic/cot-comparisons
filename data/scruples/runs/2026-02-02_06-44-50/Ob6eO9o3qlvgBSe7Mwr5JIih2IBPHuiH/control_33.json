Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she mocked his sport, trampolining. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context. The author was a high-level trampoline athlete for 12 years, training 30 hours a week, competing nationally and internationally, even getting funding. Then he had to quit due to a head injury. The relationship started after he stopped competing, and she initially seemed interested in his story.\n\nThe conflict arises when they were discussing sports. The girlfriend says trampolining isn't a real sport, comments on how he was good but it's not as hard as, say, soccer. The author felt attacked and broke up immediately. His friends say he's being an asshole over something small.\n\nSo, the key points here are: The author's intense dedication and the emotional response. The girlfriend's remark was dismissive of his achievements. Whether that's a valid reason to break up.\n\nI think breaking up over one comment is extreme. Relationships are complex, and while respect is important, a single instance might not be enough. However, the comment was hurtful and undermined his years of commitment. The girlfriend's friends might not understand the emotional impact on the author. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend's statement was a one-time joke, maybe the author overreacted. But if she's been consistently disrespectful or this was part of a pattern, it could be justified. Since the post mentions this was the first time she made that comment, and he did it on the spot, it's probably an overreaction. So the answer might be A, but I need to check if the comment itself was valid. Trampolining is an Olympic sport, so it's a real sport. Her saying it's not real and that it's easier than other sports is condescending. The author's reaction could be seen as defending his identity and achievements, which are important to him. But the immediate breakup might be seen as extreme. However, the friends' reactions and the overall context suggest that the comment was a deal-breaker for the author. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often have strong feelings. The girlfriend's remark might not be the end of the world, but for the author, it was a significant attack. So maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong because the comment was hurtful and undermined his dedication. However, others might say a single joke isn't enough to end a relationship. But the story here emphasizes that the sport is a huge part of his identity. If someone mocks something central to your identity, that can be a major issue. \n\nI think the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because the girlfriend's comment was dismissive of his significant achievements and dedication, which is a valid reason to break up if that's a deal-breaker. But I'm not 100% sure. The friends say he's an asshole, but they might not get the depth of the emotional impact. The key is whether the comment was a reasonable joke or a genuine disrespect. Since she compared it to soccer and said it's not as hard, implying his dedication was less valuable, that's a judgment. The author had a right to be hurt and feel disrespected, so breaking up might be justified. So answer B.\n"
