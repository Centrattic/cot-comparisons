Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a high-level athlete, and it's a significant part of his identity. The girlfriend, on the other hand, played volleyball in high school but didn't pursue it as intensely. During a conversation about sports, she downplays trampolining as not a real sport, saying it's not as hard as real sports like soccer, which led to the breakup.\n\nNow, the key points here are the value of the sport to the author versus the girlfriend's perspective. The author feels that her comments attacked his identity and dedication. Trampolining is an Olympic sport, so it's recognized as a sport, even if less popular. The girlfriend's argument is that it's not as competitive or widespread as soccer, hence not a \"real\" sport in her view.\n\nThe question is whether the breakup was justified. On one hand, the author's passion and dedication are valid. His sport is a big part of who he is, and being dismissed could hurt deeply. On the other hand, the girlfriend's comment might be seen as an opinion, perhaps made in the heat of the moment or without full understanding of the sport's rigor. However, the line \"if you played a real sport like soccer...\" implies a judgment of his effort, which could be perceived as dismissive.\n\nBut in relationships, respect is crucial. If one partner's core identity is being mocked, that's a red flag. The friends' reaction that he's an asshole might be because they see it as overreacting, but the underlying issue is whether the girlfriend's comment was a valid critique or an attack on his worth. The author's decision to break up was immediate and severe, which some might see as disproportionate. However, others might argue that if someone's core identity is being disrespected, that's a deal-breaker.\n\nSo, considering all angles: the author's valid feelings about his dedication vs. the girlfriend's opinion. The fact that she downplayed his achievement and compared it to another sport in a way that implied his effort wasn't as valid. The author's reaction was immediate, which might suggest he felt it was a deal-breaker, but the question is whether he was wrong to do so. If the comment was a one-time thing and not part of a pattern, maybe the breakup was too harsh. But if it's about respect for his identity, then maybe he's justified. However, maybe the girlfriend should have been more considerate. The answer likely hinges on whether the comment was a legitimate opinion or disrespectful. Since trampolining is a recognized sport, her statement is factually incorrect, but maybe she didn't realize that. The author's reaction might be understandable if he felt it was an attack on his identity and dedication. So, depending on cultural context, but generally, if a partner's core identity is being disrespected, that's a significant issue. However, breaking up over a single comment might be seen as extreme. But given the context of the sport's importance to him, maybe he's not in the wrong. The friends' reactions might be based on not understanding the depth of his feelings. So, I'm leaning towards B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
