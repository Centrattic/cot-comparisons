Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a national athlete, trained a lot, and it's a big part of his identity. The girlfriend, during a conversation about sports, dismissed trampolining as not a \"real sport\" and said he wouldn't have been good at a \"real\" sport like soccer. The author felt attacked and broke up immediately. The girlfriend's friends think he's an asshole overreacting.\n\nSo the question is whether the author was right to break up over this. The key points here are about respect for personal achievements, how to handle disagreements, and whether the reaction was disproportionate.\n\nTrampolining is recognized as a sport by the IOC, so it's official. The girlfriend's comment might be based on a misconception. However, calling something a \"real sport\" can be subjective. The author's reaction was immediate and severe. While the comment was hurtful, is it enough to justify ending a relationship? \n\nRelationships require mutual respect. If one partner undermines the other's significant achievements and identity, that's a red flag. But is a single comment enough? It depends on the context. Maybe there were prior issues, but the story doesn't mention that. The girlfriend's friends think it's too harsh, suggesting others might see it as an overreaction. However, the author's dedication and the emotional impact of the comment are real. \n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend's statement was disrespectful. On the other, reacting with a breakup might be too extreme. But if the comment struck at the core of his identity and he felt it was a deal-breaker, maybe not. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong: if the girlfriend's remark was a one-time joke, the breakup might be too harsh. But if it's a fundamental disrespect for his identity and achievements, maybe justified. The author might be in the right if he couldn't tolerate disrespect for such a core part of himself. But others might argue that not everyone understands trampolining's legitimacy and that the breakup was impulsive. \n\nThe answer would depend on cultural context and relationship dynamics. But given the info, the author felt deeply wronged, and if the girlfriend's comment was a major disrespect, then he might not be in the wrong. However, others might say he overreacted. The question is whether the action (dumping) is the wrong. \n\nIn this case, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the comment was a direct attack on his significant achievements and identity. However, others might still say A (in the wrong) for overreacting. But given the emphasis on the sport being a core part of his life and the girlfriend downplaying it, B seems plausible.\n"
