Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, trained extensively, competed nationally and internationally, and even got funding. His girlfriend made comments like trampolining isn't a real sport and that he wouldn't have been good at a \"real\" sport like soccer. He took it as an attack on his identity and dedication, so he broke up with her. Her friends said he was an asshole for overreacting.\n\nSo, the key points here are the value of the sport, the level of dedication, and whether the girlfriend's comments were valid or dismissive. Trampolining is an Olympic sport, so it is recognized as a real sport. The girlfriend's comments might stem from a lack of understanding or a dismissive attitude towards less mainstream sports. The author's reaction is based on feeling that his identity and hard work were belittled.\n\nBut is the break-up justified? Breaking up over something that's a core part of someone's identity could be seen as a valid reaction if the partner is disrespectful. However, others might argue that the comment was a minor joke taken out of proportion. The girlfriend's friends said he was an asshole, implying that breaking up over this is too harsh. However, the author's perspective is that this wasn't a small thing\u2014it's about respect for his life's work.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. The girlfriend's comment was disrespectful, but the author's reaction was immediate and severe. However, considering the emotional significance of the sport to him, the reaction isn't entirely unreasonable. The decision to break up might not be the right choice for others, but in terms of being in the wrong, if she disrespected his achievements, he might not be at fault. Yet, some might argue that the comment was a small issue that doesn't warrant ending a relationship. The key here is whether the girlfriend's comment was a one-time joke or a pattern of disrespect. If it's the former, maybe the author overreacted. If it's the latter, then it's a valid reason.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on the importance of mutual respect in a relationship. If the girlfriend didn't respect his dedication, that's a red flag. However, the author could have addressed it without an immediate breakup. But given the emotional weight, maybe it's understandable. The AITA community often considers both sides. The author isn't in the wrong if the comment was a serious disrespect towards his identity, but others might see it as too much. The answer is B (No), because the author's reaction is justified given the significance of the sport to him and the disrespectful comment from his girlfriend.\n"
