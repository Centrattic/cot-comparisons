Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he's a former high-level trampoline athlete who dedicated 12 years, trained a lot, and then got a head injury. He met his girlfriend after he stopped competing. She made fun of his sport, saying it's not a real sport and that it's easy compared to something like soccer. He took it really personally and broke up with her immediately. His friends are calling him an asshole for overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether his reaction was justified. The key points are about how he felt about his sport and her comment. Trampolining, especially in competitive terms, is definitely a sport recognized by the Olympics and has national teams. So her saying it's not a real sport is factually incorrect and dismissive. That's a problem because it undermines his hard work and dedication. He mentions that he was in the top 500 globally, which is a big achievement. For her to belittle that could be seen as attacking his identity, which he built around that sport.\n\nHowever, the question is whether his reaction to dump her on the spot was wrong. Breaking up over a single comment can seem drastic. But if the comment hit a nerve and it was a dealbreaker for him, maybe not. The girlfriend's friends say he's an asshole, implying that the issue was too trivial. But on the other hand, if this was a long-standing resentment or if this comment was a culmination of other issues, maybe not. The summary doesn't mention prior tensions, just this one incident.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's own sport, volleyball, is a real sport, so her comment seems contradictory. She might not have realized the impact of her words. But he was clearly hurt because his identity was tied to his sport. The question is about whether the response was in the wrong. If the comment was a direct attack on his achievements and identity, then breaking up might be seen as a valid reaction, even if it's extreme. On the flip side, maybe he could have talked it out first. But the fact that he was so hurt by her statement, which felt like an attack, suggests that it was a significant issue for him.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). His reaction is understandable given the personal significance of the sport to his identity. While breaking up over one comment might seem harsh, if it's a fundamental disrespect for a core part of who he is, it's not entirely his fault. However, others might argue that he overreacted. But given the context, the answer is likely B.\n"
