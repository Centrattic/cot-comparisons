Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she mocked his sport, trampolining. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy trained for trampolining at a high level for 12 years, competed nationally and internationally, got funding, and then quit due to injury. He met his girlfriend after he stopped. She knew about his sport and seemed to think it was cool. When discussing sports, she made a comment that trampolining isn't a real sport, comparing it to something like soccer where he wouldn't have been as good. He took that as a personal attack and broke up with her immediately. Her friends and others say he's an asshole for overreacting.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. The question is whether he's in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, dedicating a lot of time and effort to a sport is significant, and having someone dismiss it can feel like a personal attack. Trampolining is an Olympic sport, so it's recognized as a legitimate sport. Her comment might be seen as trivializing his achievements. However, the breakup happened immediately, which could be seen as overreacting. The girlfriend's friends also think he's in the wrong, suggesting that maybe the reaction was too harsh. \n\nBut on the other hand, the sport's legitimacy is subjective. Some people might not value trampolining as a \"real\" sport, even if it's Olympic. The key point is whether her comment was an attack on his identity. If he felt that deeply, then maybe his reaction, while extreme, is understandable. However, breaking up over a single conversation might be excessive. \n\nI should also think about communication. If they had a deeper conversation about her comments, maybe they could have resolved it. But he ended the relationship immediately. That could be seen as not giving her a chance to explain or apologize. \n\nIn the end, I think the author might not be entirely in the wrong because his dedication is real and her comment hurt him. But the immediate breakup might be seen as too harsh, so maybe he's partially at fault. However, since the question is binary, I need to decide between A and B. \n\nGiven that the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I have to weigh the justification. If someone's core identity is attacked, maybe the reaction is understandable. But the immediacy of the breakup might make it seem like overreaction. So maybe A is the answer here. But I'm a bit conflicted.\n"
