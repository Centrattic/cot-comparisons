Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her making fun of his sport is in the wrong. The scenario is presented as an \"Am I the Asshole?\" situation.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the context. The guy spent 12 years training in trampolining, was a national athlete, and it was a huge part of his identity. The girlfriend, on the other hand, has a background in volleyball. During a conversation about sports, she downplays his sport by calling it \"not a real sport\" and implies that it's easier than real sports like soccer. The guy then dumps her because it felt like an attack on his identity and dedication.\n\nNow, considering the arguments for both sides. The guy's reaction is intense. Breaking up over a comment, even if it's hurtful, might seem drastic. But the sport was a significant part of his life, leading to an injury and financial support. Her comment could have been dismissive of his hard work. However, breaking up immediately might be seen as overreacting, especially if the comment was an offhand joke.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's friends say he's an asshole for breaking up over something small. That suggests that others don't see the comment as a major issue. The question is whether the comment was a valid reason to end the relationship. While the comment was offensive, it's possible that a deeper issue existed, like her not valuing his passions, but a single instance might not justify a breakup.\n\nIn terms of societal views, trampolining is an Olympic sport, so it's recognized as legitimate. Her dismissal of it might be based on a misconception. The guy might have felt disrespected, but reacting by breaking up could be seen as disproportionate. Relationships often require working through such issues rather than ending them over a single incident.\n\nSo, the key points are: the validity of the comment as a deal-breaker, the proportionality of the response, and the importance of the sport in his identity. The answer hinges on whether the reaction was justified. Some might argue that the comment was a clear disrespect, while others might see the breakup as too extreme.\n"
