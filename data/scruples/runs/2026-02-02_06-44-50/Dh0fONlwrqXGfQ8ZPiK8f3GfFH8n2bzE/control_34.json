Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. The author is part of a group of friends where one friend is genderfluid. The author doesn't believe in the concept of genderfluidity but keeps it to themselves unless discussing. There was an incident where the author was stoned and expressed their disbelief, which led to the friend's girlfriend (GF) publicly calling them out and implying the friend might be \"trying out being trans.\" The author now feels hostile towards the group because they think they're being too sensitive, like the Tumblr culture. \n\nSo, the main points here are: the author's disbelief in genderfluidity, the public call-out by the GF, the author's stonership when making the comment, and the subsequent avoidance of the group. The author apologized and says they respect their friends regardless of their beliefs.\n\nFirst, the author is not in the wrong for having a personal belief, even if it's controversial. But the problem arises when they express that belief in a way that could be hurtful. However, the situation mentions that the author only once said they don't believe in genderfluidity, and it was in context appropriate, though under the influence. They also apologized. The key here is whether not believing in a person's identity is inherently wrong. In current societal norms, respecting someone's gender identity is considered important, regardless of personal beliefs. So, even if the author thinks genderfluidity isn't real, respecting their friend's self-identification is crucial.\n\nThe author's actions of avoiding the group due to feeling hostility might be a reaction to the group's response, but that doesn't make them right or wrong. However, the initial statement of disbelief could be hurtful. The GF's public message might have been a reaction to the author's comment. The author's belief might not make them wrong, but their expression of it in a context where it was taken personally could be seen as wrong. Also, the author mentions they don't oppose equal rights, so it's more about personal belief vs. respecting others' identities.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, even if someone doesn't believe in a concept, they're expected to respect others' choices. So, not buying into someone's gender identity could be seen as disrespectful, regardless of personal beliefs. However, the author did apologize and said they respect their friends. So maybe the issue is whether not believing in genderfluidity is acceptable if one respects the person's identity. The answer depends on whether respecting the person despite not believing in their identity is sufficient. In many cases, respecting the person's right to identify however they choose is what's important, even if one disagrees with the concept.\n\nSo, considering all that, even if the author's beliefs are their own, the act of not buying into someone's gender identity might be seen as wrong because it invalidates their experience. But the author isn't attacking them; they just don't believe in the concept. However, in social contexts, respecting others' identities is key to maintaining harmony. The author's refusal to do so, even if they say they respect the person, might lead to conflict. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because their personal beliefs are causing harm and disrespect to their friend's identity.\n"
