Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a person who doesn't believe in genderfluidity but keeps it to themselves, except when discussing it. They were stoned and said they don't believe in it, their friend's GF (girlfriend) called them out, and the friend might be experimenting with being trans. The author feels the friend is histrionic and avoids the group because they're hostile, comparing to Tumblr's sensitivity. They apologized after being influenced and said they respect friends regardless.\n\nFirst, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's break it down. The author's main issue is not buying into genderfluidity, but they don't oppose equal rights. However, they made a comment under the influence, which was called out by the friend's GF. The friend's behavior includes name changes and inconsistency in identity. The author avoids the group due to hostility and feels targeted with jokes comparing them to anti-SJW people.\n\nNow, considering social norms and respect. Even if someone doesn't believe in a concept, respecting others' identities is important. The author did apologize and says they respect their friends, but the key point is whether their disbelief and subsequent comments were harmful. The friend's GF's reaction suggests that the comment was hurtful, even if the author didn't mean to be. The author's avoidance might stem from feeling hostility, but it's unclear if that's mutual or just their perception. The name changes and identity issues from the friend might indicate genuine struggle, and the author's labeling them as \"histrionic\" could be dismissive. While the author claims to be left-leaning and accepting of equal rights, their personal disbelief and the impact of their words matter. Even if the comment was under the influence, the harm is done. The author's stance on not believing in a valid identity could be seen as transphobic, regardless of their intentions. So, in terms of social responsibility, the author is in the wrong for not respecting their friend's identity and contributing to a hostile environment. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
