Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not believing in genderfluidity but keeping their opinions to themselves except in specific discussions. They mentioned having a disagreement while stoned, which led to tension with friends who are part of a group that's more into social justice topics.\n\nFirst, the author says they don't believe in genderfluidity but don't usually voice this unless discussing it. However, they had an incident where they were stoned and made a comment, then apologized. The friend's partner accused them of being problematic, and the group seems to hold them accountable. The author also mentions avoiding the group due to feeling hostile, and now they're being joked about compared to anti-SJW people.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's personal belief vs. respecting others' identities, the context of the comment (stoned, apologized), and the reactions from the friends. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nFrom a social and ethical standpoint, respecting someone's gender identity, regardless of personal beliefs, is generally considered important. The author did express their disbelief but in a context that might be seen as insensitive. Even though they apologized, the fact that their friend's partner felt the need to call them out and that the group is upset suggests that the author's comments were hurtful. Also, the author's avoidance and the subsequent jokes they're facing might be a consequence of their actions. \n\nWhile everyone is entitled to their beliefs, how those beliefs are expressed matters. The author might not be \"in the wrong\" in terms of personal belief, but expressing doubt or disbelief in a way that harms others' feelings or relationships could be seen as problematic. The situation is nuanced, but the social aspect here is about how the author's actions affected their friends. Since the author did apologize and clarified their respect for their friends regardless of beliefs, maybe there's some mitigation. However, the ongoing issues with the group suggest that their actions had a negative impact, which could place them in the wrong in terms of maintaining respectful relationships.\n"
