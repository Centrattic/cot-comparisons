Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not buying into their friend's genderfluidity and facing some backlash.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author identifies as left-leaning, atheist, and supports equal rights. They mention they don't believe in genderfluidity but keep it to themselves unless discussing. They had a conversation while stoned where they expressed doubt, leading to their friend's girlfriend (GF) sending a group message calling them out. The GF speculated the friend might be \"trying out being trans.\" The friend in question has changed names multiple times and sometimes uses their birth name or male pronouns. The author feels the friend is being histrionic and has avoided the group due to hostility, criticizing the group's sensitivity akin to Tumblr's culture. They apologized after the incident but are being mocked for not being a \"SJW.\"\n\nNow, considering the question: Is the author in the wrong? \n\nThe author did express their disbelief in genderfluidity, which is a personal opinion. However, even if they hold that belief, the way they expressed it could be problematic. The context was a group message where the GF called them out, and they were under the influence. They apologized and affirmed respect, which is a positive step. But the fact that they publicly stated their disbelief, even in a discussion, might be seen as invalidating someone else's identity, which can be hurtful. \n\nIn terms of social dynamics, being part of a group that values sensitivity around gender identity, the author's statement might have crossed a line, even if it was in a discussion. Avoiding the group because of the hostility they felt shows that there's tension. However, the author's actions led to being mocked for not being a \"SJW,\" which the author might not fully understand the implications of.\n\nLegally, there's no issue, but socially and emotionally, the author's words could have been hurtful. Supporting someone's right to self-identify without personally agreeing is possible, but the way it's handled matters. The author apologized, which is good, but the initial statement might still be seen as harmful regardless of their intent.\n\nSo, considering the impact on the friend and the group, the author's expression of disbelief, even if they support equal rights, might be seen as wrong because it doesn't validate the friend's identity. The answer would likely be A (author is in the wrong) because they expressed a belief that could be seen as invalidating someone's identity, leading to conflict and hurt feelings, despite their apologies.\n"
