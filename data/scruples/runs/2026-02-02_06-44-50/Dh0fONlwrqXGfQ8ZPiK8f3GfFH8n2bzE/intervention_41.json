Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The author is a left-leaning atheist who doesn't believe in genderfluidity but keeps it to himself. There's a situation where a friend's partner in a long-distance relationship is genderfluid, and the author made a comment when they were stoned, leading to some conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author doesn't believe in genderfluidity but hasn't opposed equal rights. He had a discussion where he expressed his disbelief, which was in context and under the influence. He apologized and affirmed respect. However, the friend's partner felt targeted and others made jokes comparing him to anti-SJW types.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. I need to think about the impact of his words. Even if he didn't mean to be hurtful, saying he doesn't believe in genderfluidity could be seen as invalidating someone's identity. The friend's partner changed names multiple times and struggles with identity, which might mean the author's comment was hurtful. The author apologized, but the damage was done, leading to his avoidance of the group and the jokes he's now facing.\n\nAlso, the author's belief that genderfluidity isn't real, while he claims to respect others, might be conflicting. Respecting someone's identity versus disagreeing on it can be tricky. If he respects their identity but doesn't believe in the concept, that's a contradiction. So, even if he's not trying to be an asshole, his actions might have caused harm.\n\nIn AITA posts, the community often values acknowledging others' feelings and perspectives. Even if the author didn't intend to be mean, the impact on his friend's partner is significant. Therefore, the author's stance might be seen as dismissive, hence being in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
