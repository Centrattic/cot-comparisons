Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the user is asking if the person who posted the scenario is the asshole (AITA). The situation is about the author not believing in their friend's genderfluidity and causing some conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is left-leaning, atheist, and supports equal rights. They mention that they don't oppose equal rights even if they disagree with certain beliefs. However, they don't believe in the concept of genderfluidity but keep it to themselves unless discussing. \n\nThe friend's significant other (GF) is MTF (male-to-female) trans, and the other friend is genderfluid. The author had a discussion about this while stoned, and the GF took issue with it, implying the author is a bad person. The genderfluid friend has had identity changes and name changes, sometimes using their birth name or identifying as male. The author thinks the friend is being histrionic and avoids the group because of their perceived hostility and the group's \"over-sensitivity\" and \"coddling\" similar to Tumblr. The author did say once they don't believe in genderfluidity, under the influence, apologized, and affirmed respect for their friends despite their beliefs. Now they're being joked about as a mean anti-SJW person.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break down the factors. \n\nFirst, the author's right to hold personal beliefs. However, even if someone has the right to their beliefs, the way they express them matters. The author said they don't believe in genderfluidity, which is a personal belief, but when expressed, especially in the context of a friend's identity, can be hurtful. The fact that the GF of the genderfluid friend took offense directly to the author's statement suggests that the comment was inappropriate or hurtful. \n\nThe author was under the influence when they made the comment, which might be a mitigating factor, but it doesn't absolve them entirely. They did apologize and affirm respect for their friends, which is a positive step. However, avoiding the group due to the conflict and the resulting jokes about being anti-SJW might be the author's reaction to the tension, but it could also be seen as contributing to the problem by creating distance.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's statement was a personal opinion expressed respectfully or if it was harmful. The author mentions they generally keep their views to themselves unless in discussion, but in this case, the discussion led to the GF feeling the need to call out the author. The author's belief that the friend is \"histrionic\" adds another layer, suggesting possible judgment or invalidation of the friend's identity, which could be seen as transphobic, even if unintentionally.\n\nIn terms of societal norms and current attitudes, respecting someone's self-identified gender is generally considered a baseline. Even if someone has personal doubts about the concept, expressing disbelief in someone's identity can be seen as invalidating and disrespectful. The author's actions here\u2014expressing disbelief in a way that caused hurt and led to conflict\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate, especially given the personal impact on their friend.\n\nAdditionally, the group's reaction, following a \"Tumblr\" ethos, might be seen as overly sensitive by some, but the author's initial comment was probably the catalyst for the tension. The author's decision to avoid the group could be a self-preservation tactic due to feeling hostility, but it's also a way to distance themselves from the conflict, which might not be the healthiest approach.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, even if the author is coming from a place of personal belief and supports equal rights, their expression of disbelief in their friend's identity caused harm. Respecting a friend's gender identity is a social norm in many communities, and failing to do so can be seen as wrong, regardless of personal views. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting their friend's identity, even if their intention was not malicious.\n"
