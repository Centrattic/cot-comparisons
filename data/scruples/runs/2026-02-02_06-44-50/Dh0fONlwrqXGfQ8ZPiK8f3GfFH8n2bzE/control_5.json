Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author not believing in genderfluidity and being called out by their friend's girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they're on the left, atheist, and support equal rights. They don't oppose equal rights even if they disagree with certain identities. So, their stance is supposed to be inclusive, but they have personal doubts about genderfluidity. They kept it private until a discussion came up, which happened when they were stoned. That's a key point because being under the influence might have affected their judgment or how they expressed their views.\n\nThe friend's girlfriend (GF) sent a message to the group specifying the author's name, which indicates they felt personally targeted. The GF suspected the friend is being histrionic and trying out being trans. The author's friend has name changes and identity slips, leading the author to think they're being histrionic. The author avoided the group due to hostility and criticized the group's sensitivity, comparing them to Tumblr's ethos. The author apologized after the incident but still faces jokes about being an anti-SJW.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are intent, impact, and context. The author didn't outright attack their friend but expressed disbelief in a private discussion while stoned. They apologized and affirmed respect. However, bringing up disbelief in a context where a friend is transitioning or exploring their identity can be hurtful, even if the author didn't intend to be. The fact that the friend's GF called out the author specifically and the group reacted with hostility suggests that the author's words had a negative impact, even if they were under the influence.\n\nThe author's friend changing names and identities might be part of their genuine exploration, so the author's dismissal could be seen as invalidating. While the author claims to support equal rights, their personal disbelief might interfere with respecting the friend's identity. The avoidance of the group due to \"hostility\" might be on the author's side, but the public shaming could also contribute.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, even if the author didn't mean harm, the act of expressing disbelief in a context where someone is actively transitioning could be seen as harmful. The apology might be sincere, but the initial statement still caused distress. The answer hinges on whether the author's belief is a personal opinion they shouldn't express in this context, making them in the wrong despite their intentions. The friend's identity is their own experience, and the author's disbelief could be seen as disrespectful, regardless of the author's position on equal rights.\n"
