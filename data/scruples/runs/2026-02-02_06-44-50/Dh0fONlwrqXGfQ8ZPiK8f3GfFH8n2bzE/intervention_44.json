Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not believing in genderfluidity and causing some conflict with friends. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author identifies as very left-leaning and an atheist, and they don't oppose equal rights even if they disagree. They were introduced to friends, including someone who is genderfluid. The author doesn't believe in the concept of genderfluidity but keeps it to themselves unless in a discussion. There was an incident where the author, while stoned, expressed their disbelief, which led to some tension. The friend's girlfriend called out the author, and there's been hostility since. The author has since avoided the group, feeling their friends are too sensitive. They apologized and said they respect their friends regardless of their beliefs.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but wants confirmation. Let me break it down. The author expressed their disbelief in genderfluidity, even if it's a personal belief. The key points are whether expressing disbelief in someone's identity is acceptable, even if one tries to be respectful otherwise.\n\nIn many discussions around identity, especially gender identity, the general consensus is that respecting someone's self-identified gender is crucial, regardless of one's personal beliefs. Even if someone doesn't believe in a concept, they should respect others' identities. The author did express their disbelief, which might have hurt their friend's feelings, even if they apologized later. The fact that the friend changed names multiple times and the author thinks they're being histrionic might not be relevant if the issue is about respecting the friend's identity regardless of personal opinions.\n\nThe author's avoidance of the group due to hostility could be a result of the friends feeling disrespected. The author's stance might be seen as invalidating their friend's identity, which can be hurtful. Even if the author is under the influence and apologizes, the initial statement is what caused the issue. \n\nOn the other hand, the author claims they don't oppose equal rights and respect their friends regardless. But the problem here is about believing in the concept of genderfluidity. However, in terms of social etiquette and respecting others' identities, it's generally considered wrong to state disbelief in someone's identity, even if you don't act on it or are apologetic afterward. The friend's girlfriend's reaction is a sign that the comment was hurtful. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's statement about not buying the friend's genderfluidity is likely the issue here. Respecting someone's identity is separate from believing in the concept. Therefore, the author is in the wrong by expressing disbelief, leading to conflict and hurt feelings. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
