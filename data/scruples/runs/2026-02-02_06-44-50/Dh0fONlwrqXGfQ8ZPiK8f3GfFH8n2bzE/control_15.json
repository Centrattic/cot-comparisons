Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not buying into their friend's genderfluidity and the resulting conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author identifies as left-leaning, atheist, and supports equal rights even if they disagree. However, they don't believe in the concept of genderfluidity. They had a discussion while stoned, which led to their friend's girlfriend calling them out. The friend changes names and identities frequently without altering appearance or habits, leading the author to think they're being histrionic. The author has since avoided the group and feels targeted in jokes about being an anti-SJW.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The author's main issue is their disbelief in genderfluidity but trying to respect their friend despite that. The problem arises from the public nature of their disagreement, even if it was under the influence. The friend's GF perceived this as hostile, and the author's avoidance might be seen as dismissive or harmful to the friendship.\n\nThe key here is whether the author overstepped by expressing their disbelief, even if they later apologized. While everyone has the right to their beliefs, expressing skepticism about someone's identity can be hurtful, especially when the person is part of a marginalized group. The author's actions\u2014making a comment under the influence, not keeping it private, and then avoiding the group\u2014might be seen as contributing to a hostile environment, even if they meant no harm.\n\nAlso, the friend's behavior (changing names, identity) could be part of their personal journey, and the author's judgment (calling it histrionic) is dismissive. The group's reaction might be about protecting their friend's self-expression, which is a valid concern in modern social contexts where respecting identities is emphasized.\n\nIn terms of ethics, respecting others' identities and experiences is crucial, even if one personally disagrees. The author's stance might be considered inconsiderate because it undermines the friend's self-identification. Even if the author claims to respect their friend, the public expression of disbelief and subsequent avoidance could be seen as harmful.\n\nHowever, the author did apologize and clarified their respect. But the impact of their words and actions might still be negative. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given that the friend felt targeted and the group reacted negatively, it's likely the author is at fault for not respecting the friend's identity publicly, despite personal beliefs.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their public expression of disbelief, even if under the influence, contributed to a hostile environment and hurt their friend, which goes against the principle of respecting others' identities regardless of personal agreement.\n"
