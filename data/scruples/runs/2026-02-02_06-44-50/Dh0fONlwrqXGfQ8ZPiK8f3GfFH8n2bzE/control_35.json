Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for not believing in their friend's genderfluidity. \n\nFirst, the author states they don't believe in the concept of genderfluidity but keep it to themselves unless discussing. They mentioned saying this once while stoned, apologized, and clarified they respect their friends. However, their friend's partner accused them of being an asshole, implying the author is against social justice values.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. Gender identity is a personal experience, and respecting someone's self-identified gender is generally seen as a matter of respect and support. The author's public disbelief, even if stated once and in a private context, might be hurtful, especially if the friend is disclosing their identity. The fact that the author has distanced themselves from the group due to hostility adds complexity, but avoiding the group might be a reaction to previous conflict rather than the root issue.\n\nThe key points are: the author expressed doubt about genderfluidity, which led to conflict. They apologized and affirm respect, but their actions (avoiding the group) and the friend's partner's reaction suggest ongoing tension. The author's stance is against the friend's identity, which can be seen as invalidating, even if they don't oppose equal rights. \n\nIn many social contexts, supporting a friend's self-identified gender is expected, regardless of personal beliefs. The author's refusal to \"buy\" the friend's genderfluidity without changing their behavior or appearance could be seen as dismissive. The fact that the friend changes names and identities might indicate genuine exploration, which the author doesn't support, leading to the friend feeling unsupported.\n\nSo, while the author claims respect, their disbelief and subsequent actions (avoiding the group) might be harmful. The question is whether expressing a personal belief, even if it's disbelieved, is wrong. However, in this case, the author's stance is causing real harm to the relationship, as the friend and their partner feel attacked. Thus, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the friend's identity, even if they don't personally agree with the concept. The answer is likely A.\n"
