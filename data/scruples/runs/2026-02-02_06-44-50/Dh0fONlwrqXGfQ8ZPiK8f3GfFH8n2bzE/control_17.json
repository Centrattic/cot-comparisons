Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not believing in genderfluidity but trying to keep it to themselves unless discussing. The friend in question is genderfluid, and there's some tension because the author's friend's partner called out the author in a group message. The author also mentions that their friend changes names and identities frequently and that they've avoided the group due to feeling hostility.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social context. Gender identity is a sensitive topic, and people have different beliefs and experiences. The author states they don't believe in genderfluidity, which is their personal opinion, but they mention that they keep this to themselves unless in a discussion. However, they admitted to saying this once while under the influence and later apologized. The key points here are whether the author's actions were harmful despite their personal beliefs.\n\nThe friend's partner accused the author in a group message, and the author felt targeted. The author also mentions that they avoid the group because they feel hostile towards the \"over-sensitivity\" of the group. The author's reasoning for not buying into genderfluidity is their personal belief, but they claim to respect their friends regardless.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The author didn't force their opinion on others, kept it private unless discussing, and apologized when they did express it. They also stated they respect their friends regardless of their beliefs. However, the fact that they don't believe in genderfluidity, even if they keep it private, might still be an issue if it affects the friend's well-being. The friend's partner seems upset, and the author's friend is changing names and identities, which might indicate they're struggling with their identity.\n\nBut the author hasn't acted in a discriminatory way beyond their personal disbelief. They didn't out the friend or mock them publicly beyond the one instance. The main conflict is the friend's partner's reaction and the author's subsequent avoidance. The author's actions might be seen as dismissive, but they also took responsibility and apologized. \n\nIn terms of social norms, respecting someone's identity is crucial, even if you don't personally agree with it. The author's disbelief could be seen as invalidating, but as long as they treat the person with respect and don't impose their views, they might not be in the wrong. However, the fact that the friend is changing names and identity frequently could suggest that they're not fully comfortable, which might relate to the author's comments.\n\nBut the author did apologize and tried to maintain respect. It's possible they're not in the wrong because they didn't act maliciously. However, their personal disbelief might contribute to the friend's distress. The line between personal belief and respecting others' identities is thin here. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might hinge on whether not believing in genderfluidity, even with respect, is enough to be considered wrong. If the author isn't actively harmful beyond expressing their belief once and then backing off, they might not be the asshole. But if their disbelief inherently invalidates the friend's identity, then they could be in the wrong. However, since the author respects their friends and only expressed their belief once, it's a bit of a gray area. I think the answer is B, No, the author isn't in the wrong, but it's close.\n"
