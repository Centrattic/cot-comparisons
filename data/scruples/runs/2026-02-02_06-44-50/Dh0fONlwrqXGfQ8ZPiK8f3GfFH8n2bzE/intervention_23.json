Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not believing in genderfluidity, which led to some conflict with a friend who identifies as genderfluid. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author states they don't believe in genderfluidity but keep it to themselves unless discussing. However, they made a comment while stoned, which led to their friend's partner calling them out. The author then apologized and respects their friends regardless of personal beliefs. The friend changed names multiple times and sometimes refers to their birth name or male pronouns.\n\nThe author feels the friend is being histrionic and has avoided the group due to hostility. The friends are described as following a \"over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr,\" which might imply they are very sensitive to criticism. The author is being compared to \"anti SJW types,\" which they find unfair.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The author's personal belief is one aspect, but the issue is their actions. Even if they don't believe in genderfluidity, they were part of a group where their friend's identity is important. The problem arises when the author expressed their disbelief, causing hurt feelings. The fact that the friend's partner specifically called out the author suggests that the comment was hurtful. The author apologized, but the damage might have been done. \n\nRespecting someone's identity is generally considered a social norm, regardless of personal beliefs. The author claims to respect their friends regardless, but the act of questioning their identity, even if done in a private discussion, can be seen as invalidating. The friend changing names and identities might be part of their personal journey, and the author's skepticism could be seen as dismissive.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions avoiding the group because of hostility. If the group is being overly sensitive, maybe there's a communication issue. However, the author's initial comment likely contributed to the tension. The key here is whether the author's actions crossed a line by expressing disbelief in a context where it caused harm. \n\nIn terms of social responsibility, it's often advised to respect others' identities even if you don't agree with the concept. The author's stance might be personal, but the impact on their friend's feelings and the group dynamic is significant. So, even if the author's intention was to have a discussion, the result was hurtful. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong because their disbelief was expressed in a way that caused harm and disrespect to their friend's identity, despite their claims of respect. The apology helps, but the initial action was problematic.\n"
