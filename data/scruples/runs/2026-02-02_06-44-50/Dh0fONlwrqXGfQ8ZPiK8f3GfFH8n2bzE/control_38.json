Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me break this down.\n\nThe author is part of a group where a friend is genderfluid. The author doesn't believe in the concept of genderfluidity but keeps it to themselves unless discussing. Then there's a situation where, while stoned, the author expresses disbelief, which leads to their friend's girlfriend accusing them and causing tension. The author now avoids the group because they feel hostile, and others are making jokes comparing them to anti-SJW types.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is in a group where some friends have strong views on social justice issues. The friend's transition to genderfluid is a personal identity. The author doesn't believe in the concept but hasn't publicly opposed it beyond a private conversation under the influence. They apologized and respect their friends regardless of their personal beliefs.\n\nThe key points here are: the author made a comment under the influence, which was taken as offensive. The friend's partner took it as a direct accusation, leading to conflict. The author's refusal to accept genderfluidity, even if kept private, might be seen as invalidating the friend's identity. But the author claims not to oppose equal rights and respects the friend regardless.\n\nHowever, in social contexts where identity and acceptance are emphasized, expressing disbelief in someone's gender identity can be hurtful, even if it's not a public stance. The fact that the author was stoned might mitigate intent, but the impact is still there. The group's reaction, while perhaps over-sensitive, is part of their values. The author's avoidance is understandable, but the initial comment caused harm.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether expressing disbelief in a concept (genderfluidity) without actively opposing rights is considered wrong. Societal norms today often prioritize respecting personal identity, so even if someone doesn't personally believe in it, expressing doubt can be harmful. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not supporting their friend's identity, even if they don't believe in it. However, the author did apologize and doesn't oppose equal rights. It's a nuanced situation.\n\nBut the main issue is the author's public comment, which led to conflict. Even if they apologized, the act of expressing disbelief in a close group can be seen as invalidating. So, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because respecting someone's identity is generally expected, even if one doesn't personally agree.\n"
