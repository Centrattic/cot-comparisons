Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether they're being an asshole for not buying into their friend's genderfluidity.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they're a left-leaning atheist and support equal rights, but they don't personally believe in the concept of genderfluidity. They keep it to themselves unless discussing, which is good. But there's a situation where the friend's girlfriend (GF) called them out in a group message, implying the author was being an asshole. The author was stoned at the time and had a conversation where they expressed not believing in genderfluidity. They later apologized and affirmed respect for their friends regardless of their personal beliefs.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author expressed their disbelief in genderfluidity once, was under the influence, apologized, and respects their friends. However, the friend's GF is upset, and the group seems to be sensitive about this, following what they call Tumblr's over-sensitivity and coddling. The author is now being targeted with jokes comparing them to anti-SJW types.\n\nNow, considering social dynamics, even if someone's personal beliefs don't align with a friend's identity, respecting that identity is crucial. The author did apologize and stated they respect the friend's identity, so maybe they're not in the wrong. However, bringing up the topic, even in private discussions, might have caused offense. The friend changing names and identities might indicate instability, but that's not the author's fault. The main issue is whether the author overstepped by expressing their disbelief, even once, and if the subsequent avoidance is justified.\n\nIn terms of social norms, even if someone doesn't believe in a concept, they should respect others' identities. The author did apologize, which shows they tried to make amends. The fact that the group is hostile and makes jokes about the author might be their own problem. The author isn't forcing their views on others but had a private discussion where they expressed doubt. Since they clarified their position and respected the friend's identity afterward, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But the act of expressing disbelief could be seen as dismissive, hence the conflict.\n\nIt's a tricky situation because personal belief vs. respect for others' identities can clash. The author might be in the wrong for not respecting the friend's identity even if they personally don't buy into it, but they did apologize. Alternatively, since they didn't force their views and kept the discussion private, maybe they aren't. Considering the context, including being under the influence and apologizing, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong. But I'm a bit conflicted here. Let me check again. The key is that the author didn't deny the friend's identity in public, apologized, and continues to respect them. So maybe B (Not in the wrong) is the answer.\n"
