Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not believing in genderfluidity and facing some backlash from their friend's partner.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points from the post. The author identifies as left-leaning, atheist, and supports equal rights. They mention not opposing equal rights even if they disagree. They were introduced to friends where one is genderfluid. The author doesn't believe in the concept but keeps it to themselves unless discussing. \n\nThen there's a situation where, while stoned, they expressed doubts about genderfluidity. The friend's girlfriend (GF) sent a message to the group mentioning the author specifically, and in private, the GF speculated the friend is trying out being trans. The friend has had name changes and inconsistent identity expressions. The author feels the friend is being histrionic and has avoided the group due to hostility, which they associate with Tumblr's oversensitivity. The author apologized for the hurt feelings and affirmed respect for their friends despite their beliefs. Now they're being compared to anti-SJW types in jokes.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No).\n\nSo, the author's main actions are expressing disbelief in genderfluidity once while under the influence, apologizing, and then avoiding a group that they perceive as overly sensitive. The friend's partner's reaction seems to be part of the issue here. \n\nIn terms of ethics, respecting others' identities is generally considered important, especially in social contexts. Even if someone doesn't personally agree with a belief, being respectful is key. The author did express their disbelief, which the friend's partner took offense to, even if it was in context and apologetic. The fact that the author apologized and affirmed respect might mitigate some blame. \n\nHowever, the author's statement that they \"don't really believe in the concept\" of genderfluidity could be seen as dismissive of a friend's identity, regardless of the individual's circumstances. Even if the friend's expression is inconsistent, the author's disbelief might be harmful. The author's avoidance of the group due to \"hostility\" might stem from feeling criticized for their stance, but the initial expression of doubt could be the root issue.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, even if someone doesn't personally agree with a belief, they have a responsibility to be considerate and avoid causing harm. The fact that the author was under the influence might reduce the severity but not eliminate the issue. The author's continued avoidance after apologizing could be seen as not taking the conflict seriously enough.\n\nThe friend's partner's reaction might be part of a sensitive environment, but the author's initial statement was a direct expression of disbelief, which could be the problem. The author's belief in equal rights despite personal disagreements is a point in their favor, but actions (expressing disbelief) can still be harmful.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's expression of disbelief, even if in a discussion and under the influence, contributed to the friend's partner feeling the need to call out the author. The author's continued avoidance might be a reaction to the conflict, but the initial act of disbelief could be seen as dismissive of a friend's identity, thus being in the wrong.\n"
