Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the person in the Reddit post is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe author is left-leaning, atheist, and supports equal rights even if they disagree. They were introduced to a group where a friend is MTF (male-to-female) and another is genderfluid. The author doesn't believe in genderfluidity but usually keeps it to themselves. There's a situation where the GF (girlfriend) of the genderfluid friend called them out in a group message, specifying the author's name. The author mentions being under the influence when they expressed their disbelief. They also note that the friend changes names and identities frequently, still using their birth name or male pronouns. The author has distanced themselves due to the group's sensitivity and is being mocked for not being an SJW.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the author's stance on genderfluidity and the subsequent conflict. The author's friend transitioned to MTF, which is more widely accepted now, but genderfluidity is a different identity. The author's disbelief in genderfluidity is a personal opinion, but the issue is how they expressed it. They were under the influence when they said this, which might affect the context. They apologized later, though. The problem arises because the friend's GF took offense and the group is now hostile towards the author. The author feels they're being unfairly targeted.\n\nI need to assess if the author is in the wrong. If the author expressed their opinion, even if it's uncomfortable, but did so in a context where they apologized and clarified their support for their friends' rights despite disagreement, that's a factor. However, the friend's GF's reaction and the group's hostility might be overreactions if the author's comment was made in a private discussion, especially under the influence. The author's distancing themselves could be seen as a self-defense mechanism against hostility, but maybe they should have handled the situation more sensitively.\n\nThe crux is whether the author's statement was hurtful or dismissive, even if they later apologized. If the author's disbelief in genderfluidity is a personal opinion but they expressed it in a setting where it upset someone, especially when the individual (the friend) is going through an identity shift, that could be seen as insensitive. The fact that the friend changes names and pronouns frequently might indicate they're still figuring things out, making the situation more delicate. The author's comment, even if not malicious, could be hurtful if it invalidates the friend's identity, leading to the conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did apologize and stated they respect their friends regardless. Their stance is about personal belief, not hate. But the friend's GF and the group's reaction might be part of a broader culture of sensitivity around gender issues. The author might be in the wrong for making a comment that, regardless of their true beliefs, was perceived as harmful. The fact that the comment was made under the influence might not excuse it if it caused distress.\n\nIn conclusion, even if the author's intention was to express a personal view and they apologized, the impact on the friend and the group's reaction suggests that the author's actions contributed to the conflict. Hence, they might be in the wrong for not respecting the friend's identity, even if they don't personally believe in genderfluidity.\n"
