Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me start by understanding the scenario.\n\nThe author identifies as being very left-leaning and an atheist, supporting equal rights even if they disagree with certain beliefs. They mention not believing in genderfluidity but keeping it to themselves unless discussing. The issue arises when a friend's partner (the GF) publicly called out the author in a group message, implying the author was being an asshole. The author was stoned when they mentioned their disbelief in genderfluidity, later apologized, and clarified that they respect their friends regardless of personal beliefs. The friend in question is genderfluid, changes names frequently, and the author feels the situation is histrionic and has avoided the group due to hostility.\n\nNow, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are: the author expressed their disbelief in genderfluidity once, was under the influence, apologized, and continues to respect their friends. However, the friend's partner took offense and the group seems to have reacted negatively. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, respecting someone's identity is generally considered important in modern social contexts. Even if someone doesn't personally believe in a concept like genderfluidity, expressing that belief in a way that could be seen as dismissive or offensive might be problematic. The author did apologize and stated they respect their friends, which is a positive step. However, the act of publicly not buying into someone's identity, even if private, can be hurtful. The author's avoidance of the group due to hostility might also contribute to the tension.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If they expressed their disbelief once, under the influence, and then apologized, perhaps they aren't entirely at fault. However, the friend's partner's reaction and the group's sensitivity could mean that the author's statement, even if a single instance, was a breach of social norms. The author's continued avoidance might also be seen as exacerbating the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is standing by their personal beliefs and hasn't forced their views on others. They respect their friends despite their disagreements. The friend's partner might have overreacted, especially if the author had already apologized. \n\nIt's a nuanced situation. The answer depends on whether the act of not believing in genderfluidity, even if expressed once and with an apology, is considered wrong. In many communities, especially those valuing social justice, respecting others' identities is paramount, so the author might be seen as in the wrong for not affirming their friend's identity. However, the author's stance that they don't believe in the concept but still support equal rights complicates things. \n\nI think the key here is that the author's statement, even if made in a private context and under the influence, caused harm. The friend's partner's reaction and the group's sensitivity suggest that the author's words were damaging. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not supporting their friend's identity, even if they disagree. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). However, some might argue that the author isn't in the wrong because they apologized and still respect their friend. But in the context of the group's reaction and the potential harm caused, the answer leans towards A.\n"
