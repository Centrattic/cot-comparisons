Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves their friend being genderfluid, and the author not believing in the concept. They mentioned they didn't oppose equal rights but had private doubts. The friend's girlfriend called them out in a group message, leading to tension. The author also admitted to being under the influence when they expressed their disbelief and later apologized.\n\nFirst, the author's main issue is their disbelief in genderfluidity. Even though they say they respect their friend regardless, their private doubts and the fact that they said this in a situation where their friend's SO was upset might have caused hurt feelings. The key points here are whether the author's actions were respectful and considerate towards their friend's identity.\n\nThey mentioned avoiding the group due to hostility from the friends, which might be a reaction to the group's sensitivity. The author claims they only said they didn't believe in genderfluidity once, under the influence, and apologized. But even with an apology, the initial statement could be seen as invalidating their friend's experience. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for not believing in genderfluidity, even if they're not opposing equal rights. It's important to consider the context of the group's values\u2014Tumblr's over-sensitivity and coddling are mentioned, which might be a defense mechanism. The author is in a left-leaning group, so their views might be in conflict with the group's more progressive stance. \n\nHowever, respecting someone's identity is separate from agreeing with it. The author's disbelief, even if kept private, when expressed in a context that caused their friend's SO to call them out, might contribute to an environment where the author feels unwelcome. The author's avoidance could be a result of both their own discomfort and the group's reaction. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions (expressing disbelief, even once) crossed a line into being harmful or disrespectful. The author did apologize and affirmed respect, but the friend's SO's reaction suggests that the statement was hurtful. The author's belief might not make them the asshole, but their actions could have been inconsiderate. \n\nIn many cases, personal beliefs are protected, but expressing them in ways that harm others can be problematic. The author's situation is nuanced: they might not be in the wrong legally or ethically, but socially, their actions could have been inappropriate given the context. The answer might depend on whether the author's statement directly caused harm, which it seems to have, as the friend's SO was upset and the author now feels excluded. However, the author claims to respect their friend regardless of belief, so the primary issue is the expression of disbelief. \n\nGiven that, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because expressing disbelief about someone's identity can be harmful even if done once, especially when it's in a context where the friend is already vulnerable. The author's avoidance might be a consequence of both their own stance and the group's reaction, but the initial statement was likely hurtful. Alternatively, if the author's belief isn't forcing their views on others and they're just not personally buying into the concept, maybe B (not in the wrong). But the fact that the friend's SO was upset and the author was called out suggests that their statement was seen as harmful. So probably A.\n"
