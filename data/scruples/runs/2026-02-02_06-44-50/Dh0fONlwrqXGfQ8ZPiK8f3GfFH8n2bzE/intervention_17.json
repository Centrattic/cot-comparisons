Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not believing in genderfluidity and causing some conflict with friends.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author identifies as very left-leaning and atheist, so they probably support equal rights. However, they don't personally believe in genderfluidity. They had a discussion about it while stoned, which led to their friend's girlfriend (GF) being upset, mentioning them specifically. The friend is genderfluid, but the author thinks they might be histrionic or trying out being trans. The friend has changed their name multiple times and sometimes uses their birth name. The author now avoids the group because of the hostility from the friends, who are described as following Tumblr's oversensitivity and coddling. The author says they only once expressed doubt about genderfluidity, which was in context and under the influence, and they apologized. They're being mocked as an SJW by others.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for not believing in genderfluidity and expressing that, even if they apologized. From a social justice perspective, respecting people's identities is crucial. Even if someone doesn't personally believe in a concept, it's important to respect others' self-identified labels. The author's public doubt, even if made in a private context and under the influence, might have caused harm. The fact that the friend's GF called them out and the group reacted negatively suggests that the author's comment was hurtful. The author's continued avoidance of the group due to \"hostility\" might be a result of their own actions. While the author claims to respect their friends regardless, the act of expressing disbelief could be seen as invalidating their identity, which is a form of being dismissive or hurtful. The apology might not be sufficient if the underlying belief isn't changed. So, the author likely is in the wrong for not respecting their friend's identity, even if they didn't mean to be harmful. Therefore, answer A.\n"
