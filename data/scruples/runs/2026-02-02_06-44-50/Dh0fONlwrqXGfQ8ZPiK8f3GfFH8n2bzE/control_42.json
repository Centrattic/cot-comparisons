Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author posted on Reddit asking if they're the asshole for not buying into their friend's genderfluidity. The author mentions they're left-leaning, atheist, and don't oppose equal rights even if they disagree. They had a situation where a friend's GF (girlfriend?) sent a message pointing out the author's lack of support, and the author is conflicted because they don't believe in the concept of genderfluidity but try to keep it to themselves. They mentioned this once while stoned, apologized, and then avoided the group because of the hostility from the friends who are into Tumblr's oversensitivity culture. The author is now being made fun of as an anti-SJW.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author's friend is genderfluid, and the author doesn't believe in the concept. But they've only expressed this once while stoned, apologized, and said they respect their friends regardless. However, the friend's GF (or maybe GF as girlfriend, but the friend is genderfluid, so maybe GF is a typo?) is upset and the group is hostile. The author is avoiding the group and is being mocked for not being a SJW.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author's stance is that they don't believe in genderfluidity but are respecting their friends regardless. However, they made a comment under the influence and then didn't follow up. The friends are upset, and the author is avoiding the group. \n\nIn terms of social norms, respecting someone's identity is generally expected, even if one doesn't agree with the concept. The author's comment, even if made in a private setting, might be seen as dismissive or invalidating. The fact that the friend is changing names and the author thinks they're being histrionic could be contributing to the conflict. The author's avoidance might be seen as a lack of effort to maintain the friendship despite disagreements. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did apologize and affirm respect. They are left-leaning and support equal rights. The friends are being overly sensitive, according to the author, and using Tumblr's culture. The author is being targeted with jokes about anti-SJW. \n\nIn terms of ethics, respecting others' identities is a key principle. Even if someone doesn't personally believe in a concept, they are expected to respect others' identities. The author's initial comment, even if under the influence, might have been hurtful. The fact that the friend's partner is upset and the group is hostile suggests that the author's words had a negative impact. \n\nHowever, the author is trying to maintain respect and avoid conflict. They only made one comment and then tried to apologize. The problem might be more on the friends' side for being overly sensitive and hostile. But social dynamics also mean that the author's words, regardless of intent, could be harmful.\n\nSo, whether the author is in the wrong could depend on cultural context. In many modern contexts, respecting gender identity is considered essential, so not buying into it could be seen as invalidating. However, the author's actions (apologizing, affirming respect) might mitigate some of that. But the fact that they don't believe in the concept could be problematic if it leads to a lack of respect for the person's identity.\n\nThe answer could be A (author is in the wrong) because they expressed disbelief in a friend's identity, which can be hurtful, even if they later apologized. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if the friends are being overly sensitive. But given the emphasis on respecting identities in current discourse, likely the author is in the wrong for not supporting their friend's genderfluid identity, even if they don't personally believe in it. So the answer is A.\n"
