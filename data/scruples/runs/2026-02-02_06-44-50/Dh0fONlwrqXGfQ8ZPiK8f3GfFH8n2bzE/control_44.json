Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not believing in genderfluidity and facing some social consequences from their friends.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author says they don't believe in the concept of genderfluidity but keep their opinions to themselves unless discussing. They had a conversation while stoned where they expressed this disbelief, leading to their friend's girlfriend calling them out in a group message. The friend changed names and identities frequently, and the author feels their friend is being histrionic. The author has since avoided the group due to hostility and mentions that the group is overly sensitive, like Tumblr. They also mention making one comment about not believing in genderfluidity, apologized, and respects their friends regardless.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). Let's consider the context. The author's stance is personal belief, but they did express it in a situation where their friend was already transitioning and changing names. Even though they apologized, the fact that they made a comment disbelieving their friend's identity could be hurtful. The friend's GF felt the need to call them out, indicating that the comment was offensive. The author's avoidance of the group might be due to discomfort, but the initial comment could have been a breach of support for a friend's identity, which is important in relationships. The social dynamics here involve the friends expecting support, which the author's comment undermined. Even if the author respects their friends in other aspects, the specific disapproval of the friend's identity could be seen as invalidating. So, the author's actions might be considered wrong because they publicly expressed disbelief in their friend's identity, leading to conflict and social isolation. However, the author did apologize, which complicates it. But in terms of the initial action, the comment was inappropriate in that context. So likely, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
