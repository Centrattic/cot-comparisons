Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not believing in genderfluidity but keeping it to themselves except during a discussion while stoned. The friend's GF called them out in a group message, and there's been some tension since.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author says they don't believe in genderfluidity but don't oppose equal rights. They had a discussion while under the influence and later apologized. The friend's partner is upset, and the author feels targeted by jokes comparing them to anti-SJW types.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author is wrong for not buying into genderfluidity. Legally and socially, respecting someone's identity is important. Even if someone doesn't personally believe in a concept, it's about respecting others' self-identification. The author did express their disbelief in a private discussion, which might be okay if done respectfully. However, the fact that the friend's partner felt the need to call them out suggests that the comment was hurtful or not appropriately framed.\n\nAlso, the author mentions the friend changing names and identities frequently, which could indicate genuine exploration or distress. The author's judgment of this as histrionic might come off as dismissive. Even if the friend's behavior seems inconsistent, it's not the author's place to judge their identity.\n\nThe author apologized and affirmed respect, which is a good step. However, the ongoing avoidance of the group due to hostility might be their own reaction. The comparison to anti-SJW types is a bit of a red herring; the real issue is respecting the friend's identity regardless of personal belief.\n\nIn terms of social norms, being an atheist and left-leaning doesn't automatically make the author correct here. The key is whether their actions were respectful. Expressing disbelief in a private, stoned conversation could be seen as insensitive, even if it was a one-time thing and followed by an apology. The friend's partner's reaction is valid if the comment made them feel unsupported or invalidated.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because their personal beliefs were expressed in a context that caused hurt, and they should prioritize respecting their friend's identity regardless of their own beliefs. Even if they don't believe in genderfluidity, it's about supporting the person's self-identified experience. Therefore, the answer is A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
