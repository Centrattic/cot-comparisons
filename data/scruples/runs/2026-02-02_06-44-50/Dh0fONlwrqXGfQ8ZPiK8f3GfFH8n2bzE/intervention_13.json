Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author doesn't believe in genderfluidity but keeps it to themselves unless discussing. However, when they did mention it, they were stoned and later apologized. The friend's girlfriend called them out, and now the author feels targeted with jokes comparing them to anti-SJW people.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author says they're generally respectful and don't oppose equal rights, even if they disagree. But they made a comment about not believing in genderfluidity, which might be offensive to their friend. The friend's partner took issue with that and mentioned the author specifically. The author then distances themselves from the group because of the hostility they feel, but also gets mocked for not being as \"SJW\" as others.\n\nThe key points are: the author expressed a personal disbelief in genderfluidity, which is a sensitive topic. Even though they apologized, the act of voicing that disbelief in a group where the friend is transitioning might cause hurt feelings. The author claims they respect their friends regardless of their beliefs, but the situation has led to tension.\n\nI think the author might be in the wrong because, despite their intentions, expressing doubt about someone's gender identity can invalidate their experience. Even if it's a personal belief, bringing it up in a group where it's a sensitive topic can be hurtful. The fact that the friend's partner felt the need to call out the author suggests that the comment was taken as disrespectful. The author's avoidance of the group due to the \"hostility\" might be a result of their own actions, and the subsequent jokes they face could be a consequence of the conflict they initiated.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did apologize and stated they respect their friends. They might be in a difficult position trying to balance personal beliefs with supporting friends. But in terms of social norms and respecting others' identities, expressing disbelief in someone's gender identity is generally considered harmful. So the author's comment, even if made in a private discussion while under the influence, could be seen as crossing a line. Therefore, they might be at fault here.\n"
