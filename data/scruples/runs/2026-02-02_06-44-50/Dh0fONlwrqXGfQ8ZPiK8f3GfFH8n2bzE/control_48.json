Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author doesn't believe in genderfluidity but keeps it to themselves unless discussing. Then, when they were stoned, they said they don't believe in it, which their friend's girlfriend called out in a group message, implying the author was being an asshole. The author apologizes and says they respect their friends regardless. Now they're asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's friend's girlfriend is genderfluid, and the author doesn't believe in the concept. The author made a comment under the influence, which led to some conflict. The author then apologized and says they respect their friends. The question is whether the author is wrong for not believing in genderfluidity but trying to be respectful otherwise.\n\nIn terms of social norms and current societal views, respecting someone's identity is generally expected, even if you don't agree with it. The author's issue is their personal belief, but they didn't act out against their friend. They expressed their disbelief once, under the influence, and then apologized. The friend's girlfriend seems sensitive, maybe overreacting because the author didn't support the genderfluid identity. However, the author claims they respect their friends regardless of their beliefs. \n\nBut the problem is that the author's disbelief might be seen as invalidating the friend's identity. Even if they don't believe in it, expressing that can hurt feelings. However, the author didn't confront them directly and only mentioned it once in a discussion. The friend's girlfriend's reaction might be part of a more general sensitivity around gender issues. \n\nAlso, the author avoided the group due to the hostility, which suggests they felt unwelcome. The jokes comparing them to anti-SJW types might be the others being hostile. \n\nSo, the author's main fault is expressing disbelief in a context where it's considered important to support others' identities. Even if they apologized, the initial statement might be seen as harmful. However, they are trying to be respectful and don't actively oppose their friend. \n\nIn many cases, people are expected to support others' identities regardless of personal belief. So the author is in the wrong for not supporting their friend's identity, even if they don't believe in it. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
