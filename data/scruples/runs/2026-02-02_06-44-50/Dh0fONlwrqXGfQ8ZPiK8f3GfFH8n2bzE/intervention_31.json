Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not believing in genderfluidity and causing some tension with a friend who is genderfluid. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author identifies as left-leaning and an atheist, supporting equal rights even when they disagree. The friend in question is in a long-distance relationship with someone who is MTF (male-to-female). The friend recently identifies as genderfluid. The author doesn't believe in the concept of genderfluidity but usually keeps it to themselves unless discussing. \n\nThere's an incident where, while stoned, the author expressed their disbelief, which led to the friend's GF (girlfriend?) sending a message to the group pointing out the author specifically. The GF also speculated that the friend might be testing being trans. The friend has had issues with their name and identity, changing names four times, using male pronouns or their birth name sometimes. The author thinks the friend is being histrionic and has avoided the group because of the hostility from the friend's side, who they say are over-sensitive like Tumblr. The author admitted they said they don't believe in genderfluidity once, apologized, and affirmed respect. But now they're being mocked as an anti-SJW.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider a few angles. First, gender identity is a sensitive topic. Even if someone doesn't believe in a certain identity, respecting others' self-identification is generally considered important. The author admitted to not believing in genderfluidity but stated they usually keep it to themselves. However, in a situation where they were stoned and expressed this disbelief, which caused offense. The friend's partner directly called the author out, which suggests that the group felt disrespected. The author apologized, but the damage was done, leading to ongoing issues.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's belief doesn't excuse causing harm. Even if they apologized, the initial statement was hurtful. The author's avoidance due to the group's \"hostility\" might be a reaction to feeling attacked, but that doesn't validate the initial hurtful statement. Also, the author's comment about \"over-sensitivity\" and comparing themselves to anti-SJWs might come off as dismissive of the other person's feelings, which can be seen as invalidating. \n\nIn terms of ethics and social norms, respecting others' identities is crucial. Even if one doesn't agree with or understand someone's identity, it's important to support and respect them. The author's disbelief in genderfluidity is their personal view, but expressing that in a way that harms others is problematic. The fact that the friend is struggling with their identity and changing names might indicate they are in a vulnerable state, and the author's comments could be adding to that stress.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did apologize and said they respect their friends regardless. However, actions have consequences, and public statements in a group chat can lead to lasting tensions. The author's justification of being \"under the influence\" might not be a valid excuse for causing hurt, especially if they were aware of the friend's situation.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's disbelief in a concept that's part of someone else's identity, leading to public criticism and causing distress, likely makes them in the wrong. They should have chosen to keep their personal beliefs private to respect their friend's identity, even if they don't agree. The fact that they caused direct harm, even with an apology, probably means they are in the wrong.\n"
