Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not believing in genderfluidity and how it's affecting their friendship.\n\nFirst, the author says they don't believe in the concept of genderfluidity but keep it to themselves unless discussing. They mentioned a situation where they were stoned and said this, leading to their friend's girlfriend (GF) calling them out. The GF speculated the friend might be \"trying out being trans,\" and the friend has changed names and identity frequently. The author feels the friend is being histrionic and has been avoiding the group because they feel hostile and coddled, referring to the Tumblr sensitivity thing. They apologized after being called out and affirmed respect, but now face jokes comparing them to anti-SJW people.\n\nSo, the question is: Is the author in the wrong? Choices are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me break it down. The author's stance on genderfluidity is personal belief, but they made a comment that was context-appropriate, though under the influence. They apologized and respect their friends regardless. However, the friend's partner is upset, and the author is being ostracized. \n\nGender identity is a sensitive topic. While the author claims not to oppose equal rights, their public disbelief might be hurtful even if private. However, they did apologize and maintain respect. The friend's partner's reaction seems to have escalated things, leading to the author avoiding the group. The author's avoidance might be a defense mechanism against perceived hostility.\n\nFrom a social justice perspective, dismissing someone's gender identity can be harmful, even if done in private. But the author did address the issue after being called out. The key points are intent vs. impact. The author's comment, even if made in a private discussion (though in a group message?), might have impacted the friend's self-perception negatively. \n\nBut the author says they were stoned and later apologized. The fact that the friend's name changes and identity shifts might indicate genuine struggle, and the author's skepticism could be invalidating. However, the author claims they respect their friends regardless of personal beliefs. \n\nThe community might see the author as not fully respecting their friend's identity, hence the friend's partner's reaction. But the author is trying to navigate between personal beliefs and respecting others. The outcome is that the author feels targeted, hence the AITA question.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's about whether their actions crossed a line. If they expressed disbelief in a public/private group chat context, that could be seen as disrespectful, even if they later apologized. The friend's partner's reaction and the subsequent jokes about being an anti-SJW might indicate that the author's initial comment had a negative impact, despite their apology. However, the author's intention was not to be hostile, just to express a personal belief.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because expressing disbelief in someone's gender identity, even if in a private discussion, can be hurtful and invalidating. The fact that they were stoned might be a mitigating factor, but the impact is still there. The author's avoidance could be seen as not making amends fully, but the initial action is what's in question here.\n"
