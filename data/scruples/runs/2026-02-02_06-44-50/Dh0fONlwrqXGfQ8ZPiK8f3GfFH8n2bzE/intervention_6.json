Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not believing in their friend's genderfluidity and causing some tension.\n\nFirst, the author says they don't believe in genderfluidity but keep it to themselves unless discussing. However, there was an incident when they were stoned where they said they don't believe in it. The friend's girlfriend called them out, and the author apologized, saying they respect their friends regardless. But the author now feels targeted with jokes comparing them to anti-SJW types.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about respect for someone's identity. Even if someone doesn't personally believe in a concept like genderfluidity, it's important to respect the individual's self-identified gender. The author did express their disbelief in a situation where it upset their friend, which could be seen as invalidating the friend's identity. While the author apologized, the act of expressing doubt in someone's identity, especially in a group setting, can be hurtful. \n\nAlso, the author is avoiding the group because of the hostility, which might be a consequence of their own actions. The friend's change in name and identity is part of their personal journey, and the author's comments might not support that. The author's stance, even if they are left-leaning and an atheist, doesn't excuse invalidating someone's identity. \n\nSo, even if the author didn't mean to be hurtful, the impact of their words matters. Respecting others' identities is crucial in maintaining relationships and being considerate, regardless of personal beliefs. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
