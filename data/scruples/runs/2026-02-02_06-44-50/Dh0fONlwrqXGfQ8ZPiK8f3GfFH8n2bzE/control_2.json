Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author doesn't buy into the concept of genderfluidity but tries to keep their opinions to themselves. However, they had a conversation while stoned where they mentioned not believing in it, and then the friend's GF accused them of being an asshole. Now the author is being criticized and is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author states they are liberal, support equal rights, and don't oppose them even if they disagree. They don't believe in genderfluidity but don't voice it unless discussing. The issue arose when they were stoned and made a comment, then apologized later. The friend's partner is upset, and the group seems to be very sensitive, maybe influenced by Tumblr's culture of over-sensitivity. The author feels they're being targeted as an anti-SJW.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main ethical considerations here are respect for others' identities and the impact of one's words. While the author claims they don't oppose equal rights, their personal disbelief in genderfluidity could be seen as invalidating someone's identity. Even if they apologized, the act of expressing that disbelief, especially when it's a core part of someone's identity, might be considered harmful. \n\nHowever, the author also mentions they only made the comment once, under the influence, and then apologized. They also state they respect their friends regardless of their beliefs. The problem is whether the comment itself was wrong, regardless of intent. In many social contexts, especially among close friends, respecting someone's self-identified gender is seen as a baseline. So, if the author's comment was a direct rejection of that identity, it's likely to be hurtful and considered wrong, even if they later apologized.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a group that's described as \"over-sensitive\" and following a certain ethos. It's possible that the friend's partner overreacted, but the author's refusal to accept genderfluidity as a valid concept could still be problematic. Even if the author didn't mean to be derogatory, their disbelief might undermine the friend's experience.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's stance, while perhaps not malicious, does involve dismissing a valid identity that others hold. Even if they apologize, the act of not believing in someone's gender identity can be hurtful and contribute to a hostile environment. Therefore, the author's position might be seen as the wrong one because respecting others' identities is generally expected, even if one personally disagrees. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
