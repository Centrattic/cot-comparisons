Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about someone not buying into a friend's genderfluidity and avoiding the group because of it. \n\nFirst, the author says they don't believe in genderfluidity but keep it to themselves unless discussing. Then, there was a conversation where they were stoned, and they said they don't believe in it. The friend's GF mentioned they think the friend is trying out being trans, and the friend has had name changes and identity shifts. The author now avoids the group and feels hostility because the group is too sensitive.\n\nThe key points here are the author's public statement of disbelief, the context (they were stoned), and the subsequent avoidance. The author also apologized and respects their friends despite their beliefs. \n\nBut the problem is, even if the author is being honest about their beliefs, they might have caused hurt feelings. The question is whether it's wrong to not believe in someone else's gender identity. From what I know, respecting someone's identity is important, even if you don't agree. But the author did say they respect their friends regardless. \n\nHowever, avoiding the group because of their sensitivity could be seen as dismissing their feelings. The author might be contributing to a hostile environment by not engaging. Also, the friend's GF called out the author specifically, which might indicate that the comment was hurtful.\n\nSo, while the author is being honest, their actions (avoiding the group, not respecting the friend's identity) could be seen as wrong. The answer might be A (in the wrong) because they didn't support a friend's identity and caused hurt, even if they later apologized. But maybe B if the context was a private conversation where the author expressed their honest belief and took responsibility.\n"
