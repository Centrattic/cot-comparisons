Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not believing in their friend's genderfluidity. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points from the post. The author identifies as left-leaning and atheist, supports equal rights even when they disagree. They were introduced to friends, one of whom is genderfluid. The author doesn't believe in genderfluidity but keeps it to themselves unless discussing. There was an incident where the author, while stoned, expressed doubt about genderfluidity. The friend's GF (girlfriend?) messaged the group, calling out the author specifically, and there's speculation that the friend might be trying out being trans. The author mentions that the friend has changed names multiple times and sometimes refers to their birth name or male identity.\n\nThe author now avoids the group due to hostility, feels they're being compared to anti-SJW types, and wants to know if they're the asshole. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, gender identity and expression are personal and valid experiences. Dismissing someone's gender identity, especially when they've stated it, can be considered harmful. The author isn't just keeping their opinions to themselves; they've expressed doubt in a group context, even if they later apologized. The friend's GF was upset, and the author's comments contributed to the group's hostility. The author's avoidance might be due to discomfort but could be seen as withdrawing support from a friend. The key here is that the author's disbelief in genderfluidity, even if not forced on others, can invalidate the friend's identity. Respect for personal identity is crucial, and not buying into it despite the person's assertion can be seen as disrespectful. Also, the author's influence in the group and their role in creating a hostile environment might place the blame on them. The fact that they apologized might mitigate some issues but doesn't erase the initial harm. So, considering all that, the author's stance could be considered wrong because they're not respecting their friend's identity, leading to tension and avoidance. Therefore, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
