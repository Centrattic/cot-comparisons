Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for not buying their friend's genderfluidity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is part of a group where two friends are in a long-distance relationship. One is transgender (MTF), and the other recently identifies as genderfluid. The author doesn't believe in the concept of genderfluidity but keeps it to themselves unless discussing. The situation escalated when the author, while stoned, expressed disbelief, and the friend's girlfriend called them out publicly and privately speculated the author might be anti-SJW. The author then distanced themselves from the group, leading to tension.\n\nThe key points here are the author's personal belief conflicting with the friend's identity. The author claims not to oppose equal rights but struggles with the concept. They admitted their stance once, apologized, and respect their friends regardless. However, the friend's GF took offense, leading to the group treating the author as a hostile outsider.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The main issue is whether it's acceptable to hold personal beliefs that don't align with others' identities. The author did express their disbelief, which is a personal opinion, but the friend's GF and others reacted negatively. The author's actions\u2014avoiding the group due to hostility\u2014might be a defensive response, but the initial expression of disbelief could be seen as invalidating the friend's identity. Even if the author respects their friends, the act of questioning someone's gender identity can be hurtful and disrespectful, especially in a context where the group values sensitivity. \n\nThe author's apology and affirming respect are positive, but the core issue is the belief itself and how it's communicated. In many modern perspectives, questioning someone's gender identity, even with respect, can be seen as dismissive. The friend's GF's reaction, while maybe over-sensitive, is a response to a perceived attack on their partner's identity. The author's subsequent distancing might be a result of the group's reaction, but the original stance might still be considered wrong for not respecting the friend's self-identification. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is likely A\u2014the author is in the wrong. They expressed a belief that invalidates someone else's identity, even if they didn't intend harm. Respecting others' identities, despite personal beliefs, is generally expected in such contexts. The public rebuke from the friend's GF and the resulting group dynamics support that the author's stance was problematic.\n"
