Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author questioning their friend's genderfluidity. The author says they don't believe in the concept but keep it to themselves unless discussing. They mentioned a situation where they were stoned and made a comment, then apologized. The friend's partner accused them, and now they're being called out as an \"anti SJW.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's friend identifies as genderfluid, which is a valid gender identity. The author's problem is with not buying into that concept. But the key here is whether the author's actions were inappropriate. \n\nThe author did make a comment, but under the influence and apologized. They also respect their friends regardless of their beliefs. However, the friend's partner was upset, and the group seems to take it seriously. The author is being called an asshole because of this. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the issue is about respecting others' identities. Even if the author doesn't personally believe in a concept, respecting others' self-identified gender is crucial. By not buying into the genderfluidity, the author might be invalidating their friend's experience. Even if they apologized, the initial comment could be hurtful. \n\nAlso, the author mentions their friend changing names and identities frequently, which could be part of exploring their identity. However, the author's judgment about that exploration might be the problem. The partner's concern about the friend trying out being trans adds another layer, but the author's main issue is their own stance on genderfluidity.\n\nSo, the question is whether it's wrong to not accept someone's gender identity. Legally and socially, respecting someone's identity is expected. The author's belief doesn't excuse not respecting their friend's identity. Even if the author is left-leaning, their personal disbelief in the concept could still make them at fault. The fact that they caused hurt feelings and were called out suggests they might be in the wrong. \n\nBut there's also the part where the author apologizes and respects their friends regardless. Maybe that lessens the wrongdoing? However, the main issue is the invalidation of their friend's identity. So, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong because they don't accept their friend's identity, even if they apologize later.\n"
