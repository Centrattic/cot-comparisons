Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the author identifies as left-leaning and an atheist, supporting equal rights. However, they don't personally believe in genderfluidity. They had a discussion about it while stoned, leading to their friend's GF accusing them of being an asshole. The friend in question is changing names and identities frequently, and the author feels the friend is being histrionic. They've distanced themselves from the group, who they perceive as overly sensitive and following Tumblr's ethos. The author apologized after the comment and respects their friends regardless, but now faces mockery for being an \"SJW.\"\n\nThe key points here are: the author expressed doubt about genderfluidity in a context where it might not have been appropriate, especially under the influence. They apologized but the friends still reacted negatively. The author is now caught in a social conflict between their personal beliefs and the expectations of their friend group.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's issue is not with supporting equal rights but with their personal disbelief in genderfluidity. However, respecting someone's identity is separate from believing in the concept. Even if the author doesn't personally believe in genderfluidity, they have a responsibility to respect their friend's self-identified gender. The problem arises when their disbelief leads to disrespect or invalidation of the friend's identity, which can be hurtful. The author claims they keep their views to themselves unless discussing, but in this case, their comment was made in a group chat, leading to hurt feelings. \n\nThe author's apology shows an acknowledgment of the hurt caused, but the ongoing conflict suggests that their actions (distancing themselves from the group, making jokes) might be part of the issue. The answer hinges on whether the author's personal beliefs, even if kept private, are causing harm by not respecting the friend's identity, and whether their actions (like making jokes) are contributing to the problem. The correct stance is that respecting someone's identity is crucial regardless of personal beliefs. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not supporting their friend's gender identity, even if it conflicts with their personal views.\n"
