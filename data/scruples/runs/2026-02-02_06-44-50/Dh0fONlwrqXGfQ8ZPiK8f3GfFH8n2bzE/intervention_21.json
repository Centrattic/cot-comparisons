Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not believing in genderfluidity but trying to keep their opinions to themselves unless discussing. However, they made a comment under the influence of drugs, which led to some conflict with a friend who is genderfluid. The friend's girlfriend called out the author, and the author now feels targeted by jokes comparing them to anti-SJW types.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author claims to support equal rights and doesn't oppose them, even if they disagree. They mention they don't believe in the concept of genderfluidity but keep it private. However, they had an incident where they expressed doubt publicly (in a group chat) while stoned, which upset their friend. The friend's partner thought the author was being dismissive, and the friend has been inconsistent with their name and identity. The author has since avoided the group, feeling hostility from them. They apologized and affirmed respect, but the group has made jokes about them.\n\nNow, considering social norms and respect for identity. Gender identity is a significant part of a person's self-perception. Even if someone doesn't personally believe in a concept, it's important to respect others' identities in social contexts. The author's public doubt, even if couched in private discussion, might be seen as invalidating the friend's identity. The friend's partner's reaction suggests that the author's comment was hurtful and contributed to a hostile environment.\n\nThe author did apologize and stated they respect their friends regardless of their beliefs. But the action of expressing disbelief in a public context (a group chat) with a friend who is transitioning their identity could be seen as crossing a line. Even if the author is trying to be open-minded, their actions caused distress. The fact that the friend is changing names and identities might be part of their journey, and the author's skepticism could be undermining that.\n\nHowever, the author claims they only mentioned their disbelief once, in context, and while under the influence. They also say they respect their friends despite their views. The conflict seems to stem from differing values\u2014personal belief vs. respecting others' identities. In many social contexts, especially in modern discussions around identity, respecting someone's self-identification is considered a baseline. So, even if the author doesn't personally agree, their public expression of disbelief, leading to hurt feelings, is likely seen as inconsiderate.\n\nThe author's avoidance of the group due to feeling hostility is a reaction, but if the initial comment was hurtful, the responsibility lies with them. The friends' reaction, while perhaps over-sensitive to the author's perspective, might be justified in wanting validation and support for their identities. The jokes comparing the author to anti-SJW types are a response to their stance, which the author finds unfair, but if they contributed to the conflict, the friends might be reacting appropriately.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's public doubt and the resulting impact on their friend's feelings, even if done in a discussion context, probably makes them at fault here. The key is that respecting others' identities is more important than personal disbelief, especially in a social group where such issues are sensitive.\n"
