Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author in the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not believing in genderfluidity but keeping their views private unless discussing it. They were stoned when they mentioned their disbelief, leading to some conflict with their friend's partner.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author is an atheist and left-leaning, which they mention for context. They were introduced to friends, one of whom is transgender and another who recently identifies as genderfluid. The author doesn't believe in genderfluidity but hasn't spoken out unless in discussions. However, during a stoned conversation, they expressed their disbelief, which led to the friend's partner addressing them directly. The author then changed their name multiple times and had inconsistent identity references. The author feels the group is too sensitive, avoiding them, and is now being mocked as an anti-SJW.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue here is the author's belief in genderfluidity (or lack thereof) and how they expressed it. The author says they generally keep their views to themselves unless in discussion, which might be seen as respectful. However, saying they \"don't believe in the concept\" of genderfluidity, even in private discussions, could be problematic because it dismisses someone's identity.\n\nThe scenario mentions that the friend's partner accused the author of not supporting their partner, implying that the author's disbelief led to hostility. The author apologized and affirmed respect, but the friend group still seems to hold a grudge. The author is now being mocked for being anti-SJW, which they find unfair.\n\nFrom a social dynamics perspective, even if someone holds personal beliefs, public or private expressions that dismiss someone's identity can lead to conflict, especially in sensitive topics like gender identity. The fact that the author was under the influence when they made the comment might be seen as a mitigating factor but doesn't absolve them entirely. The key here is whether the author's actions were respectful and considerate of their friend's identity.\n\nThe author claims to respect their friends regardless of personal beliefs. However, not believing in a concept that someone uses to define their identity can be hurtful, regardless of intent. The group's reaction (hostility and jokes) suggests that the author's stance, even if not publicized, was perceived as harmful. The author's avoidance of the group due to this hostility might be a self-protective measure but doesn't negate the possibility that their initial statement contributed to the conflict.\n\nIn terms of ethics, respecting others' identities is generally considered important, even if one disagrees. The author's position could be seen as invalidating their friend's experience, which can be as hurtful as opposing equal rights. While the author doesn't oppose equal rights, their personal disbelief in the concept they're using might not align with supporting the individual's right to identify as they choose.\n\nTherefore, even if the author's intention wasn't malicious, the impact of their words on their friend's partner and the group's reaction indicates that the author's stance might be considered wrong in this context. The answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong because they expressed a disbelief in someone's identity, contributing to the conflict despite their personal respect.\n"
