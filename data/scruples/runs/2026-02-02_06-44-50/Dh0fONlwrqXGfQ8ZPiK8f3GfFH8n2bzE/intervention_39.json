Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the author identifies as left-leaning and an atheist, so they might expect support for equal rights. However, they mention not believing in genderfluidity but keeping it to themselves unless discussing. The situation arises when the friend's girlfriend (GF) sends a message to the group, specifically mentioning the author in parentheses, which makes the author feel targeted. The friend in question is genderfluid, but the author thinks they're being histrionic and has changed names and identities multiple times. The author was stoned when they expressed their disbelief in genderfluidity, apologized later, and affirmed respect for their friends. Now they're being mocked for not being as \"SJW\" as others.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author's belief (or lack thereof) in genderfluidity, their public statement under the influence, the friend's GF's reaction, and the group's subsequent hostility. The author is now avoiding the group due to this. The question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nFrom a social perspective, even if someone doesn't personally believe in a concept like genderfluidity, respecting others' identities is generally considered important, especially in a group setting. The author did make a statement under the influence, apologized, but maybe the way they expressed their disbelief came off as dismissive or hurtful. The friend's GF might have felt that the author was undermining their partner's identity, which is a sensitive topic. The author's avoidance could be seen as a reaction to feeling criticized, but the group's reaction (mocking them for not being SJW enough) might be excessive. However, the author's initial comment could be seen as contributing to the problem.\n\nThe author's stance on not buying into genderfluidity is a personal belief, but in a social context where others are affirming it, there's an expectation to respect others' identities even if you disagree. Publicly stating disbelief, even in a discussion, might be seen as invalidating someone's self-identity, which can be hurtful. The fact that the author apologized and affirmed respect shows they tried to make amends, but the initial statement might have caused damage.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author's right to hold their own beliefs versus the social responsibility to respect others' identities. The answer would depend on whether expressing disbelief in a private discussion (even under the influence) is considered harmful. Some might argue that it's the author's right to hold that view, while others would say that in a group where others are affirming, it's important to refrain from expressing such views, even in private. The fact that the friend's GF felt the need to message the group specifically about the author suggests that the author's comment was particularly hurtful or dismissive.\n\nThe group's reaction, including jokes comparing the author to \"anti-SJW\" types, seems unfair if the author is being respectful despite their disbelief. But the author's initial statement might have set the stage for this conflict. So, the author might be in the wrong for expressing disbelief in a context where it could be perceived as invalidating someone's identity, even if they later apologized. However, they did acknowledge their mistake and tried to respect the friends, which complicates things.\n\nI think the key factors are: 1) The author's comment was in a private discussion, not public, but still hurtful. 2) The apology and attempt to respect friends' identities. 3) The group's overreaction and hostility. But the initial comment still caused issues. So, the author might be in the wrong for making the comment, even if they didn't mean to be hurtful, because it led to conflict. However, others might argue that it's not their place to \"believe\" in genderfluidity, just to respect the person. But in practice, respecting someone's identity often involves acknowledging their self-described gender, regardless of personal beliefs. Therefore, the author's disbelief is their own, but their expression of it in a way that caused harm makes them at fault. So, answer A (author is in the wrong).\n"
