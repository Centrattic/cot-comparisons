Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not believing in their friend's genderfluidity.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they're left-leaning and supportive of equal rights, which is a good start. They say they don't oppose equal rights even if they disagree. But then there's the part where they don't believe in the concept of genderfluidity. That's a problem. While personal beliefs are personal, respecting someone's identity is different from agreeing with every aspect of it. The friend's gender identity is their reality, regardless of others' beliefs.\n\nThe situation escalates when the friend's GF messages the group, specifically mentioning the author, and there's speculation that the friend is \"trying out\" being trans. The author admits to slipping up on the friend's name and identity, which shows they're not respecting the friend's chosen identity. Changing names and using correct pronouns is a basic form of respect for trans and genderfluid individuals. The author's slip-ups indicate they're not making the effort to support their friend.\n\nThe author was stoned when they expressed their disbelief, but even under the influence, making such a statement can hurt someone's feelings. They did apologize, but the damage might still be there. The fact that they've avoided the group because of the hostility shows that their actions caused rifts, which is not ideal when it comes to maintaining relationships, especially with vulnerable friends.\n\nThe author also mentions being targeted with jokes comparing them to anti-SJW types. This might be a result of their own actions, given the sensitivity around gender identity. The key points here are respect for the friend's identity, effort to support them despite personal beliefs, and the impact of their words and actions on the group dynamics.\n\nIn summary, while the author claims to respect their friend regardless, their actions (not using the correct name/identity, causing hostility) and words (not believing in genderfluidity) are harmful. Respecting someone's identity isn't about agreeing with every aspect but about acknowledging their experience and supporting them. The author is in the wrong because they're not showing that necessary support and respect, leading to conflict in the group.\n"
