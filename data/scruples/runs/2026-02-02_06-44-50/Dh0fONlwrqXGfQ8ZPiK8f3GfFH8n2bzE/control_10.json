Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author doesn't believe in genderfluidity but keeps it to themselves except during discussions. They had a conversation while stoned where they expressed their disbelief, and then the friend's partner called them out in a group message. The friend in question is genderfluid, changes names a lot, and the author thinks they're being histrionic. Now the author is avoiding the group because of the hostility and is being compared to anti-SJW types.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author says they don't oppose equal rights even if they disagree. They only once mentioned not believing in genderfluidity, which they say was in-appropriate context and under the influence. They apologized and respect their friends regardless. But the friend's partner was upset, leading to tension.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's think about social norms and respect. Even if someone doesn't personally believe in a concept like genderfluidity, it's important to respect others' identities. Expressing disbelief, even once, can be hurtful, especially if it's in a group setting or when someone is under the influence. The fact that the friend's partner called them out suggests that the comment was offensive. The author did apologize, but the ongoing tension and avoidance might indicate that the apology wasn't enough or that the author's continued skepticism is causing issues.\n\nAlso, the author mentions avoiding the group due to feeling hostility, which could be a result of their own comments. They're now being compared to anti-SJW types, which implies that their stance is seen as opposing social justice values. Since the author identifies as left-leaning and an atheist, they might feel conflicted about this comparison. However, it's possible that their actions, even if not malicious, are still hurtful. \n\nIn terms of whether they're in the wrong, intention matters but so does impact. The author didn't mean to be hurtful and apologized, but their words still caused harm. In many communities, especially those that value social justice, expressing disbelief in someone's identity can be seen as invalidating and harmful. The fact that the friend is changing names and identities might make them more sensitive to such comments. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is stating their personal belief and hasn't taken any harmful actions beyond the comment. They respect their friends regardless. But respect in practice might require not expressing those beliefs, even if they're personal. \n\nSo considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because their disbelief was expressed in a way that hurt their friend, even if unintentionally. The key here is whether it's acceptable to voice skepticism about someone's identity, even if you respect their rights. In many cases, the answer is no, because it's about validating others' experiences. Therefore, the author's actions, though possibly not malicious, might still be hurtful and thus they could be in the wrong."
