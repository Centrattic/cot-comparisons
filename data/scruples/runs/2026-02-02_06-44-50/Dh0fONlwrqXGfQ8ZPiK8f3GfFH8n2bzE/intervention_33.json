Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author says they don't believe in genderfluidity but keep it to themselves unless discussing. They made a comment about not believing in it while stoned, and then their friend's GF called them out in a group message. The author then avoided the group because of the hostility and the friend has changed names and identities multiple times, leading the author to think the friend is being histrionic. The author mentions the group is \"Tumblr\" which they associate with over-sensitivity and coddling. They also say they apologized and respect their friends despite their beliefs. The question is whether the author is the asshole (A or B).\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's refusal to acknowledge their friend's gender identity, making a statement doubting a valid identity, possibly under the influence, and then avoiding the group. The friend's GF is upset, and the group is applying social pressure. The author claims they don't oppose equal rights and respect others, but their actions (not buying the identity and avoiding the group) might be problematic.\n\nIn terms of ethics, respecting someone's identity is generally considered important, even if you disagree. The author's statement, even if made while stoned, could be hurtful. The fact that the friend has changed names and identities might be part of their journey, and the author's judgment of them as \"histrionic\" is dismissive. The author's avoidance of the group might be a form of punishment or withdrawal of support, which could be seen as not respecting the friend's choice to live authentically. \n\nThe apology is a mitigating factor, but if the author hasn't made a real effort to support their friend despite the apology, that might not be enough. The author's intention was to keep disagreements private, but the public call-out by the GF and the subsequent treatment by the group adds to the conflict.\n\nConsidering the social context, even if the author is left-leaning and supports equal rights in theory, their personal attitude towards their friend's identity is causing harm. The answer likely hinges on whether respecting someone's identity is a matter of personal belief or a necessary act of respect regardless of belief. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong because they're not respecting their friend's self-identified gender, leading to social distancing and hurt feelings. So the answer would be A.\n"
