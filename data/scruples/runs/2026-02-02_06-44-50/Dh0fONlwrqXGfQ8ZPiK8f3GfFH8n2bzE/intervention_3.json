Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author doesn't believe in genderfluidity, which is a concept they find histrionic. The author is a self-described left-leaning atheist who supports equal rights but has issues with this specific friend's genderfluid identity.\n\nSo, the key points: The author made a comment about not believing in genderfluidity when they were stoned. The friend's girlfriend accused them of being hostile. The author then avoids the group because they feel hostility towards the Tumblr-style sensitivity. They also mention the friend has been changing names and identities frequently, which the author thinks is histrionic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's belief alone makes them wrong. Just because someone doesn't believe in a certain identity doesn't automatically make them wrong, but how they express it matters. The author says they keep their beliefs to themselves unless discussing, but here they made a comment under the influence. Then they apologized and affirmed respect. \n\nHowever, even though they apologized, the fact that they publicly stated they don't believe in genderfluidity, especially in a context where the friend's partner felt targeted, could be problematic. The author might be dismissing a significant part of their friend's identity, which can be hurtful. The group's reaction is about feeling supported, and the author's comment might have breached that trust. \n\nAlso, the author's avoidance of the group could be seen as a form of punishment or withdrawal of support, which might not be justified if their intention was to respect the friend despite their beliefs. The author mentions they support equal rights, but this seems to affect their personal relationships.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's behavior (changing names, etc.) might be genuine for them, and the author's skepticism could be invalidating. Even if the author's intention was to avoid conflict, their actions caused tension. The key here is whether expressing disbelief in someone's identity, despite personal support for equal rights, crosses a line into disrespect or harm. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's statement, even if made under the influence and later apologized for, seems to be a dismissal of their friend's identity. That could be seen as harmful, especially in a close friend group. The author's subsequent avoidance might be a result of feeling ostracized, but their initial action of expressing disbelief in a context where it was taken as hostility likely contributed to the conflict. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect their friend's identity, even if they didn't act with malice.\n"
