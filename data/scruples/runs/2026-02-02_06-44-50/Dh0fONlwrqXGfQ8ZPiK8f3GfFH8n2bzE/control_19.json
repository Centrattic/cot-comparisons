Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author doesn't believe in genderfluidity but keeps it to themselves unless they're discussing it. They were stoned when they mentioned their disbelief, and the friend's girlfriend called them out in a group message. The friend has been changing names and identities a lot, and the author feels the friend is being histrionic, so they've been avoiding the group. The author is now asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author identifies as left-leaning and an atheist, and they don't oppose equal rights. But they don't personally believe in genderfluidity. The key points here are that the author spoke up once while under the influence, apologized, and said they respect their friends regardless. However, the friend's partner took offense, leading to the friend feeling targeted. The author is being accused of being an anti-SJW, which is a sensitive term here.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author's stance is that genderfluidity isn't real for them, but they don't oppose others' rights. They had a private disagreement, which led to some tension. The problem arises when the author's private statement was taken publicly, leading to jokes about them being an SJW. \n\nFrom a social perspective, even if someone doesn't believe in a certain identity, respecting someone's self-identification is important. The author's issue isn't with the friend's identity but with the concept itself. However, expressing disbelief in a way that upholds the friend's rights and safety is crucial. The author says they apologized and respect their friends, so maybe they weren't intentionally harmful. But by not buying into genderfluidity, they might be dismissing the friend's identity, which could be hurtful. \n\nThe friend's partner's reaction might be part of the problem too. If they're being overly sensitive, as the author suggests, then maybe the group is contributing to the tension. But the author's avoidance of the group due to feeling hostility might be a result of that sensitivity. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author's actions (one comment under the influence and subsequent avoidance) versus the friend's reaction. The author did apologize, so taking responsibility is there. However, the act of not believing in someone's identity, even if they respect their rights, might still be problematic because it can invalidate the person's experience. \n\nSo, the author's stance is on personal belief, but in social contexts, respecting others' self-identified terms is usually expected, regardless of personal beliefs. Therefore, even if the author doesn't think genderfluidity is valid for themselves, they might still be in the wrong for not accepting it for others, especially a friend. The key is whether dismissing the concept causes harm. If the friend's partner is over-sensitive, but the author's comment was in a discussion context, maybe it's a grey area. But generally, respecting others' identities is a societal norm, so the author might be in the wrong for not supporting their friend's self-identified genderfluidity, even if they don't believe in it themselves.\n"
