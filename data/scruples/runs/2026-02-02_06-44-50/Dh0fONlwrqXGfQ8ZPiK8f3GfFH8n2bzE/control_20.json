Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not believing in genderfluidity and a friend's partner being genderfluid.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they are politically left, an atheist, and support equal rights even if they disagree. They say they don't openly oppose the concept of genderfluidity but keep their views private unless discussing. The conflict arises when they were stoned and expressed skepticism about their friend's genderfluid identity. The friend's partner then publicly called out the author and speculated that the friend might be \"trying out being trans.\" The friend changes their name multiple times and sometimes uses their birth name or male pronouns. The author feels histrionic and has avoided the group due to hostility, mentioning they follow a sensitive, Tumblr-like ethos. They apologized after being under the influence and said they respect their friends despite their beliefs. Now, they're being mocked as anti-SJW.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). Let's consider the key points. The author's main issue is not buying into genderfluidity, but they claim to respect their friends regardless. They did express skepticism once while stoned and apologized. However, the friend's partner's public accusation and the resulting group dynamics might be problematic. The author's stance on not believing in genderfluidity could be seen as invalidating the friend's identity, even if they don't act on it except in one instance. However, the author is in a left-leaning circle where such views might be more accepted, so expressing skepticism could be seen as out of step, leading to conflict. The author's avoidance and the friend's name changes and inconsistent identity might contribute to the tension. The key here is whether not believing in genderfluidity is inherently wrong, which is a subjective matter. However, in the context of a friend's identity, not supporting it could be seen as disrespectful, even if the author says they do respect the person. The public call-out and the author's private doubts might have crossed a line, making the author at least partially responsible. On the other hand, if the friend's identity is fluid and the author's only transgression is a one-time comment under the influence followed by an apology, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. But the fact that they don't believe in it at all might still be problematic. The answer might hinge on whether disbelieving in genderfluidity is considered harmful regardless of how it's expressed. Since the author's actions led to conflict and they were called out, but they apologized and respect the person's rights, it's a nuanced situation. However, in many modern contexts, not accepting someone's gender identity, even if they change it, could be seen as being in the wrong. So the answer is likely A (Yes).\n"
