Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not believing in genderfluidity and facing criticism from a friend's partner.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they're generally left-leaning and support equal rights, even if they disagree. They had a discussion while stoned where they expressed doubt about genderfluidity and later apologized. The friend's partner accused them of hostility, leading the author to avoid the group. The author also notes that the friend who is genderfluid changes names and identity frequently, which the author finds histrionic.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the author expressed their disbelief in genderfluidity, apologized, and respects their friends regardless. However, the friend's partner and others in the group are upset, perceiving the author as hostile. The author avoids the group because of the hostility they feel from the group's over-sensitivity.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, even if someone doesn't personally agree with someone's identity, respecting their self-identification is important. The author did apologize, which shows they tried to make amends. However, the fact that they avoid the group might be seen as taking a side or being unwilling to engage despite their apology. But the author claims they're being treated like an anti-SJW, which might be a misunderstanding or miscommunication.\n\nThe author's issue is with the concept of genderfluidity, but as long as they respect the person's identity regardless of their personal beliefs, they might not be in the wrong. However, if their avoidance and the initial statement caused harm or distress, that's where it's tricky. The friend's partner's reaction could indicate that the author's words were hurtful, even if they apologized. Also, the author's judgment of the friend's behavior as histrionic might contribute to a hostile environment.\n\nBut the author did apologize and affirm respect. The problem might be more on the friend's side for being overly sensitive. However, in many social contexts, expressing doubt about someone's identity, even if couched as a personal belief, can be seen as invalidating. So even if the author didn't mean to be hurtful, the impact is what matters. The fact that the group is reacting negatively suggests that the author's statement crossed a line, making them the asshole. But since they apologized, maybe not entirely? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if the author is genuine in respecting their friend's identity despite not believing in the concept, maybe they're not in the wrong. It's a bit of a gray area. However, the main issue is the public statement and the subsequent avoidance. The author's actions might contribute to the conflict. So perhaps they are partially at fault for expressing disbelief, even if they apologize. But it's hard to say definitively. The answer could be A (yes, the author is wrong) because their disbelief was expressed in a context that caused hurt and led to avoidance, despite the apology. Or B (no) because they tried to make amends and support their friend otherwise.\n\nI think the key is that the author admitted to expressing disbelief in a group setting while stoned, which might be seen as careless, leading to hurt feelings. Even with an apology, the fact that they avoid the group and make judgments about the friend's behavior as histrionic might indicate they're in the wrong. So probably A.\n"
