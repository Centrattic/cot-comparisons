Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not believing in the concept of genderfluidity and causing some tension.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author states they are left-leaning, atheist, and support equal rights. However, they don't personally believe in genderfluidity but keep their opinions to themselves unless discussing. They were stoned when they mentioned their disbelief, which led to their girlfriend's friend (the GF) being upset. The GF accused the author of being an asshole, and there's been ongoing issues with the friend changing names and identities. The author has since avoided the group due to their sensitivity and is facing jokes comparing them to anti-SJWs.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. The author's main issue is their disbelief in genderfluidity but not acting on it, except in a specific instance. They were under the influence when they expressed their disbelief, which led to conflict. They apologized and affirmed respect for their friends regardless of their personal beliefs.\n\nFrom a social and ethical standpoint, respecting someone's identity is crucial, even if you personally don't agree with it. The author's problem might be in not keeping their opinion private. Even though they apologized later, the initial statement could have been hurtful, especially under the influence. The fact that the friend is genderfluid and the GF is trans adds layers of sensitivity here. The author's avoidance of the group due to their over-sensitivity might also be contributing to the conflict.\n\nHowever, the author does mention they don't oppose equal rights and respect others despite their beliefs. The main issue seems to be their public expression of disbelief, which was stoked by the GF. The question is whether expressing a personal belief, even if it's considered incorrect by others, is wrong in this context. The author did apologize, which shows they recognized the impact of their words, but the ongoing tension suggests that their words had lasting effects.\n\nIn many cases, especially in modern discussions around identity and gender, the emphasis is on respecting individuals' self-identification regardless of personal beliefs. So, even if the author truly doesn't believe in genderfluidity, it's considered respectful to acknowledge and respect that identity in others. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for expressing their disbelief in a way that caused harm, even if their intention wasn't malicious. The key point is the impact on the friend's identity and the subsequent conflict.\n"
