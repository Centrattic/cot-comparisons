Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for not believing in their friend's genderfluidity. \n\nFirst, the author identifies as left-leaning and an atheist, emphasizing they support equal rights even if they disagree with certain views. The main issue arises from a friend who is genderfluid, and the author doesn't believe in the concept. The friend's girlfriend accused the author of being dismissive, especially after a group message where the author's name was called out. The author was stoned at the time, made a comment, apologized, and clarified their respect.\n\nNow, the key points here are about respect and personal beliefs. The author is not forcing their beliefs on others, just expressing their own. They did apologize and affirm respect. However, the friend's identity is central to them, so dismissing that can be hurtful. The author is in a minority in their belief but is trying to maintain a respectful stance despite their personal views.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on societal standards of respect and acceptance. Even if someone doesn't personally agree with a person's identity, it's considered respectful to acknowledge and support it. The author did express their belief but then apologized and stated their respect. However, the act of not believing in someone's identity can be seen as invalidating, which might contribute to a hostile environment, especially if the group is sensitive.\n\nBut the author isn't attacking the friend's identity beyond expressing disbelief, and they've made amends. The friend's girlfriend might be overreacting by including the author's name in the group message and making assumptions. The author's avoidance of the group due to perceived hostility is also a factor. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, while personal beliefs are protected, the expectation is to respect others' identities. The author's comment, though made in a context where they were stoned, might have been hurtful, but they took steps to apologize. The key here is whether the author is respecting the friend's identity despite their disbelief. If they are, then they might not be in the wrong. However, the fact that they don't believe in genderfluidity at all could be seen as problematic, regardless of their other actions.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author is in a complex situation. They expressed a personal belief, apologized, and maintained respect. However, their disbelief in a fundamental aspect of their friend's identity might still be hurtful, even if they aren't attacking it directly. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not believing, or if the friend's group is being overly sensitive. In many cases, respecting someone's self-identified gender is considered a social imperative, even if one personally disagrees. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not accepting their friend's identity, despite their own beliefs. But the answer is nuanced because the author isn't attacking but rather expressing disbelief. \n\nWait, but the core issue is whether the author is in the wrong for their disbelief. In most social contexts, respecting someone's identity is expected regardless of personal beliefs. So even if the author doesn't believe in genderfluidity, they should still respect their friend's self-identification. The fact that the author does apologize and maintains respect in other ways might mitigate some blame, but the initial disbelief and the subsequent actions (like avoiding the group) could be seen as contributing to the problem. The friend's group might feel disrespected, even if the author isn't directly attacking them. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not fully respecting their friend's identity.\n"
