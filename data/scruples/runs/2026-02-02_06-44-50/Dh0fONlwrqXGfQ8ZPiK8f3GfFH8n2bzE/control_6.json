Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe author is part of a group with friends where one is in a relationship with someone who identifies as genderfluid. The author doesn't believe in the concept of genderfluidity but keeps it to themselves. However, during a stoned conversation, they expressed their disbelief, leading to the friend's GF accusing them and making them feel hostile towards the group. The author now feels targeted in jokes comparing them to anti-SJW types and wants to know if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author claims not to oppose equal rights, which is a key point. They also mention they only expressed their disbelief once, under the influence, and apologized. The friend's GF took offense, possibly overreacting. But how does that play into the situation?\n\nGenderfluidity is a real and valid identity for many people. The author's disbelief, even if kept private, when voiced publicly\u2014even under the influence\u2014could be hurtful. The friend's GF might have felt that the author's statement undermined their partner's identity, leading to the group's reaction. The author's avoidance of the group due to hostility is a consequence they're feeling, but it's also possible they contributed to it by making a disparaging comment.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's comment was a genuine expression of their disbelief or something more hurtful. Since the author apologized and respects their friends regardless, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, the act of doubting someone else's identity, even if not overtly hostile, can be seen as invalidating. So the author's stance might be considered problematic even if they didn't intend to be.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's GF might have overreacted by singling out the author and making assumptions about their intentions. The group's subsequent treatment of the author as an anti-SJW could be unwarranted, but the initial comment from the author did create tension.\n\nIn terms of social ethics, respecting others' identities is crucial. Even if the author's disbelief is genuine, expressing it in a group setting, especially under the influence, might have been unkind. The author's stance is based on personal belief, but it's essential to acknowledge others' experiences. While the author apologized and respects their friends, the act of voicing disbelief in genderfluidity can be seen as disrespectful.\n\nTherefore, the author's comment, even if not malicious, might be considered the wrong action. However, the friend's GF's response might have escalated things unnecessarily. The balance lies in whether the author's expression of disbelief was a minor transgression or a significant issue. Given that the author apologized and respects the friend's identity, maybe they aren't entirely in the wrong. But the initial statement could still be problematic.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether expressing disbelief in someone's identity, even with an apology, is a transgression. If the community values respecting identities above personal beliefs, then the author is in the wrong. If the reaction from the friend's GF was overly sensitive, then the author isn't. But since genderfluidity is a valid identity, doubting it can be hurtful. So the author's belief, while personal, isn't excusing the impact of their words. Hence, the author might be in the wrong for expressing disbelief, even if they apologized.\n"
