Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is about a friend being genderfluid and the author not buying into the concept. The author mentions that they don't believe in genderfluidity but keep it to themselves unless discussing. Then there's a situation where the friend's GF points out the author's name in a group message, and the author was under the influence when expressing their disbelief. The author apologized later and respects their friends regardless.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the author violated any norms or was disrespectful. The key points are: the author stated they don't believe in genderfluidity, but only once, in context, and was stoned. They apologized and affirmed respect. The friend's partner felt targeted, leading to group tension. The author has avoided the group due to hostility.\n\nThe question here is whether not believing in a gender identity is wrong. But in terms of social interactions, respecting someone's identity is usually expected regardless of personal beliefs. Even if someone doesn't believe in a concept, how they express that matters. The author said they kept their opinion private unless discussing, but in this case, the friend's partner felt called out. The author's statement might have been hurtful, even if they apologized. However, they did apologize and showed respect. But the main issue is whether the belief itself is wrong. Not believing in genderfluidity is a personal belief, but the way it's expressed affects others. Since the author caused hurt feelings, maybe they are at fault for expressing that belief in a way that upset their friend's partner. However, if they just hold the belief without acting on it, it's not inherently wrong. The problem might be the context (stoned) and the fact that the group is sensitive. The author is also avoiding the group due to feeling hostility, which might be the other side's overreaction. \n\nIn terms of social responsibility, even if you don't believe in someone's identity, you're expected to respect it. The author's belief isn't the issue, but their actions (expressing disbelief in a context that caused harm) might be. However, they apologized. The key is whether the author was wrong for holding and expressing that belief, even if they apologized. If the expression was a one-time thing under influence and followed by an apology, maybe not wrong. But if the community is expected to accept all gender identities, then the author's belief could be seen as harmful, even if kept private. It's a bit of a nuanced situation. The answer might depend on whether the belief is considered harmful. Since the question is about being the asshole, if the author's actions (expression and subsequent avoidance) caused issues, maybe they are at fault. But if they tried to apologize and respect, maybe not. I think it's a judgment call, but leaning towards A (author is in the wrong) because respecting others' identities is important in modern social norms, and even if they believe differently, their expression and the impact on the friend's partner matters. However, if the author is just holding a belief without being harmful, they're not in the wrong. But since they caused hurt, maybe A is the answer.\n"
