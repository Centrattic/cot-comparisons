Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether the author is the asshole (AITA) for not buying their friend's genderfluidity. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is described as being left-leaning, atheist, and supportive of equal rights even if they disagree on certain issues. They mention not believing in genderfluidity but keeping it to themselves except during discussions, which happened once when they were stoned. After that, the friend's girlfriend called out the author in a group message, and the author's friend has been changing names and identities, which the author thinks is histrionic. The author has since avoided the group because of the hostility from the friends who are into Tumblr's oversensitivity. The author apologizes and says they respect their friends regardless of their beliefs but now faces jokes comparing them to anti-SJWs.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author expressed a personal belief (disbelief in genderfluidity) in a context where it might have been inappropriate, especially since they were under the influence. They then faced backlash from their friend group, leading to them avoiding the group. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom a social perspective, even if someone has personal beliefs, it's important to respect others' identities publicly. The author admitted to not believing in genderfluidity but kept it to themselves except when discussing. However, the fact that they were under the influence might have affected their judgment. The friend's partner took offense and mentioned the author specifically, which could have led to tension. The author did apologize and affirmed respect, but the friend group's reaction seems harsh, using the author as an example in jokes. \n\nBut the main issue is whether the author was wrong to express their disbelief. In modern social contexts, especially in progressive circles, questioning someone's gender identity can be seen as transphobic, even if done privately. The author did apologize, but the fact that they publicly stated their disbelief (even if once) might have caused harm, especially if the friend is genuinely genderfluid. However, the author's friend seems to be going through changes, which might indicate they are exploring their identity rather than being firm in their genderfluidity. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, the author is honest about their beliefs and respects their friends. On the other hand, questioning someone's identity can be hurtful, especially if that person is in a vulnerable state. The author might not be in the wrong because they didn't force their opinion on others and apologized, but they could be seen as insensitive for expressing doubt in a situation where the friend is struggling with their identity. The friend group's reaction, while perhaps over the top, is a response to the author's statement. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the answer hinges on whether the author's statement caused harm. Since the friend is changing names and identities, maybe their genderfluidity is genuine or in flux. The author's disbelief might have contributed to the friend feeling unsupported. However, the author's intent was to keep their beliefs private except during discussions. The key is that the author did express disbelief, which led to conflict, even if they later apologized. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they apologized and respect their friends, but they did express a view that could be hurtful. However, considering the friend's situation, the author's disbelief might be seen as dismissive. So, the answer could be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they expressed a belief that caused tension and hurt feelings despite their apology.\n"
