Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is about the author not buying into their friend's genderfluidity. The key points are:\n\nThe author identifies as very left, atheist, and supports equal rights even when they disagree. They mention they don't believe in the concept of genderfluidity but keep it to themselves unless discussing. The situation arose when the author was stoned and made a comment, leading the friend's GF to message the group, specifically calling out the author. The friend in question is changing names, using different pronouns, and the author thinks it's histrionic. The author apologized and respects the friends but feels targeted with jokes comparing them to anti-SJW people.\n\nFirst, the author did say they don't believe in genderfluidity, even if it was under the influence. The friend's partner felt targeted, which led to the group's reaction. The author claims they apologized and respect their friends, but the issue is whether not believing in someone's identity, even if kept private, is wrong.\n\nIn terms of social standards, especially within progressive circles, respecting someone's identity is often paramount. Even if one doesn't personally agree with the concept, respecting the individual's self-identification is key. The author's public statement, even if made under the influence, might have contributed to a hostile environment. The fact that the friend is changing names and identities might be part of their journey, and the author's skepticism could be seen as invalidating their experience.\n\nBut the author does mention they apologized and support equal rights, so maybe they aren't entirely at fault. However, the act of publicly stating disbelief, even once, can be hurtful and contribute to a toxic environment, especially when the friend's partner called them out. The key is whether the author's actions crossed the line into being dismissive of someone's identity.\n\nConsidering the context, the author might be seen as in the wrong because respecting someone's identity is often considered more important than personal beliefs in these situations. The author's skepticism led to conflict and they were called out, which suggests that their stance was problematic within the group's dynamics. So, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
