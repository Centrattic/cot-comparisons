Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated. The user is asking whether the author is the asshole (AITA) for not buying into their friend's genderfluidity. \n\nFirst, the author identifies as very left-leaning, supports equal rights, and is an atheist. They mention they don't oppose equal rights even if they disagree. The friend in question is genderfluid, and the author doesn't believe in the concept but keeps it to themselves unless discussing. \n\nThe friend's girlfriend (GF) sent a group message asking everyone to be supportive, specifically mentioning the author. The GF also privately speculated that the friend is \"trying out being trans.\" The author points out that the friend slips up on their name and identity, hasn't changed appearance or habits, and has changed their name four times. The author thinks the friend is being histrionic and has avoided the group due to hostility. \n\nThe author said once, while stoned, that they don't believe in genderfluidity. They apologized and affirmed respect for their friends. Now they're being compared to anti-SJW types.\n\nSo the main issues here are: 1) the author's belief (or disbelief) in genderfluidity, 2) their public expression of that belief, even under the influence, and 3) the subsequent avoidance of the group. \n\nThe author's problem is that even though they claim to respect their friends regardless of personal beliefs, saying they \"don't believe in genderfluidity\" is problematic. Gender identity is a personal experience, and dismissing it as not real can be hurtful. The fact that the friend's GF felt compelled to call out the author suggests that the comment was offensive. \n\nThe author apologized, but the damage might already be done, especially if the friend is still exploring their identity. The author's skepticism combined with the friend's name changes and inconsistencies might lead to doubts, but that's not a reason to dismiss the friend's identity. People can express their identity in various ways, and changing names doesn't invalidate their experience. \n\nThe author's avoidance of the group due to \"hostility\" could be a result of their own actions. They might have created tension by expressing disbelief, leading to the group's over-sensitivity. The author's comparison to anti-SJW types is a consequence of their own stance, even if they think they're being reasonable. \n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, respecting someone's identity, even if you don't understand or agree with it, is crucial. The author might not be malicious, but their words and actions have caused strain in the friendship. The key is whether the author's disbelief and the way they expressed it were harmful. Since the friend's GF felt it necessary to address it and the group dynamics have soured, the author is likely in the wrong. \n\nAnswer: A (Yes, the author is in the wrong)\n"
