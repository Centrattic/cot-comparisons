Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nThe author is part of a group of friends. One of their friends is in a long-distance relationship with someone who is MTF (male-to-female) and now identifies as genderfluid. The author doesn't personally believe in genderfluidity but keeps it to themselves unless discussing. There was an incident where the author, while stoned, expressed their disbelief, and the friend's GF took offense, sending a message to the group. The friend in question has changed names multiple times and sometimes uses their birth name, leading the author to think they're being histrionic. The author has since avoided the group due to hostility, feeling the group is too sensitive. They apologized after the argument and respect their friends, but now face jokes comparing them to anti-SJW types.\n\nFirst, the author's disbelief in genderfluidity but choosing not to voice it except when discussing is a personal stance. However, when they did express it (while under the influence), it caused offense. Even though they apologized, the fact that they made a statement that hurt someone's feelings is problematic. The key here is whether the author's statement was harmful or not. Believing that someone's identity as genderfluid is invalid can be seen as dismissive and invalidating. In many communities, especially those that value diversity and inclusion, such remarks can be hurtful, even if the speaker apologizes later.\n\nThe author mentions they are left-leaning and an atheist, which might suggest they support equal rights. However, their personal belief conflicting with their friend's identity creates a conflict. The issue is that respecting someone's identity is different from agreeing with or believing in it. Even if the author doesn't believe in genderfluidity, they can still respect their friend's right to identify that way. The fact that the friend has changed names and sometimes uses their birth name could be part of their self-discovery, which the author might not understand but should still approach with empathy.\n\nThe author's avoidance of the group after the incident might be due to feeling hostility, but if the group is reacting to the author's initial comment, it's possible that the group felt their friend's identity wasn't respected. The jokes comparing the author to anti-SJW types suggest that the group perceives the author as part of a problematic group, which could be a result of the initial comment, even if the author didn't intend it.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's statement was a personal belief expressed in a context where it was not appropriate, especially when it caused hurt to a friend. The fact that they were stoned is a mitigating factor but doesn't excuse the harm caused. The author's actions led to tension in the group, which might be seen as their fault. However, the author did apologize and respects their friends regardless of their beliefs. \n\nBut considering that the friend's identity is a personal and sensitive matter, the author's disbelief, even if not voiced often, when expressed in that context, could be seen as dismissive. The key question is whether the author is wrong for holding that belief and expressing it in a way that hurt someone. Since the author acknowledges the hurt and apologized, maybe the main issue is the initial statement leading to the group's reaction. However, the author's belief itself isn't inherently wrong, but the way it was expressed and the impact on the friend's feelings is.\n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong, the author might not be \"in the wrong\" for their beliefs, but their actions (expressing disbelief in a hurtful way) could make them responsible for the conflict. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer hinges on respecting someone's identity versus personal belief, the author might not be in the wrong for their belief but could be in the wrong for the way they expressed it. But the problem is whether the belief itself makes them wrong. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, respecting others' identities is considered important, even if you don't believe in them. So, the author's disbelief isn't necessarily wrong, but not respecting the friend's identity by expressing disbelief in a way that causes harm is. However, the user's question is whether the author is in the wrong, which could be a yes if their actions caused harm despite their beliefs. But if the question focuses on the belief itself, then no. However, the scenario is about the impact of the statement, so the answer might lean towards yes (A) because the author's statement caused harm, even if they didn't intend it. Alternatively, some might argue that the author isn't in the wrong for having different beliefs, and the group reaction is over-sensitive. \n\nGiven the context and the potential harm caused by the author's statement, even if under the influence, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because their expression of disbelief led to conflict and hurt feelings, despite their apology.\n"
