Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not buying into a friend's genderfluidity. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is described as left-leaning and an atheist, so they probably support equal rights but have personal disagreements. They mention not believing in the concept of genderfluidity but keeping it to themselves except in discussions. Then there's a situation where the friend's partner called out the author in a group message for being an asshole. The author was stoned when they made their comment about not believing in genderfluidity, apologized, and respects their friends regardless.\n\nThe friend is changing names and identities, and the author thinks they're being histrionic. The author avoids the group because of the hostility and mentions the group follows over-sensitive Tumblr norms. The author says they only once said they don't believe in genderfluidity, which was in context and under the influence, then apologized.\n\nNow, the key here is whether the author is wrong. The question is about respecting others' identities. Even if the author doesn't believe in a concept like genderfluidity, respecting someone's self-identification is usually considered important in modern society. The fact that the author made a comment, even if it was under the influence, and then apologized might mitigate some blame, but the ongoing avoidance and the group's reaction could be seen as problematic.\n\nThe author's friend changed names and identities multiple times, and the author's comment about not believing in it could be hurtful. The partner's message to the group about being supportive suggests that the friend is sensitive about this. The author's public stance, even if they personally apologize, might still be seen as invalidating the friend's experience. So, even if the author respects their friend's rights, not believing in the concept itself can be disrespectful. The author is choosing to distance themselves, which could be seen as not supporting their friend, hence being in the wrong.\n\nBut then again, the author says they respect the friends regardless. However, the act of not buying into someone's identity, even if they say they respect the person, can still be harmful. The line between personal belief and respecting someone's self-identity is thin. So, likely, the author is in the wrong because they're not supporting their friend's self-identified genderfluidity, which is a core part of their identity. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
