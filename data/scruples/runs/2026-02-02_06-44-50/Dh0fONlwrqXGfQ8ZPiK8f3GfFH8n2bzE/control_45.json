Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author not believing in genderfluidity and a friend's partner getting upset about it. The author says they're as left as they come but don't believe in the concept. They had a discussion while stoned, and the partner accused them of being a problem. The author apologized and said they respect their friends regardless.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions they don't oppose equal rights but disagree with the concept. However, in a discussion, they expressed this disbelief. The friend's partner was upset and called out the author specifically. The author changed their name multiple times and seems to be in a state where their identity is fluid. The author is now avoiding the group because they feel hostility from the friends who are more into the \"over-sensitivity\" of Tumblr.\n\nNow, the key points: The author expressed a personal belief that some might find offensive, even if they later apologized. But the question is whether that makes them the asshole. The partner felt directly targeted, which caused conflict. Even though the author apologized, the act of stating disbelief in someone's identity (especially when it's part of their self-perception) can be hurtful. The author's avoidance might also contribute to tension.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, even if someone's beliefs are their own, expressing them in a way that disrespects someone else's identity (even if unintentionally) can be problematic. The partner felt the need to call out the author, which suggests that the comment was hurtful. However, the author did apologize and affirm respect. But the ongoing conflict and the fact that the author doesn't seem to accept genderfluidity as valid might still make them the asshole. The partner is defending their friend's identity, and the author's disbelief is seen as invalidating. So, the answer might lean towards Yes (A), but I need to check if the author's position is within their right to hold, even if it's not popular. However, in social contexts, respecting others' identities is often expected, even if one disagrees. So, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting that aspect of their friend's life, leading to the conflict. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
