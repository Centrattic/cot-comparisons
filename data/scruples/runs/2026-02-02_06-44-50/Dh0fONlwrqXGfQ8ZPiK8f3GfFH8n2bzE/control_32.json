Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is a self-described left-leaning atheist who supports equal rights. They mention they don't oppose equal rights even if they disagree with certain concepts. The main issue here is their stance on genderfluidity. The author doesn't believe in the concept but usually keeps it to themselves unless discussing it. \n\nThe situation involves a friend who identifies as genderfluid. The friend's partner is concerned about the author's attitude, especially after a private message from the partner suggesting the author might be against genderfluidity. The author was stoned when they expressed their disbelief and later apologized. The friend has had identity issues, changing names and sometimes using their birth name or male pronouns. The author avoids the group because they feel hostile towards their overly sensitive approach, comparing them to Tumblr's culture. The author is being teased for being an \"SJW\" (Social Justice Warrior), hence the AITA question.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the author's belief (or disbelief) in genderfluidity, the context in which they expressed it (stoned, apologized, and kept it to themselves otherwise), and the impact on their friend and group dynamics.\n\nThe author does mention they respect their friends regardless of personal beliefs. They also apologized for hurting feelings. However, the friend's partner is upset, and the author is being accused of not supporting their friend's identity. The author's actions led to avoidance of the group, which might be seen as dismissive or disrespectful, even if unintended.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, respecting someone's identity is generally considered important, even if one doesn't personally believe in the concept. The author's public stance in the group, even if under the influence, might have caused hurt feelings. While the author apologized, the fact that they don't support the concept and distance themselves could be seen as not being fully supportive, which is a valid perspective in many social circles, especially progressive ones.\n\nHowever, the author also states they support equal rights and don't oppose them, which is a key point. They might be in a conflict between personal beliefs and social expectations. The main issue is whether not believing in genderfluidity makes the author wrong, especially if it affects their friend's feelings and relationships.\n\nIn many modern contexts, respecting someone's self-identified gender is expected, regardless of personal beliefs. So, even if the author doesn't personally endorse genderfluidity, not respecting their friend's identity could be seen as harmful, thus making the author in the wrong. The fact that their friend is struggling with identity and changing names might indicate that support is crucial here. The author's avoidance due to disagreements might be seen as not being a supportive friend, hence them being in the wrong.\n"
