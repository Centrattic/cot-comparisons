Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the provided scenario. The author is someone who identifies as left-leaning and atheist, supporting equal rights. However, they personally don't believe in genderfluidity and have expressed this once while stoned. The friend in question is genderfluid, changing names and sometimes using their birth name or male pronouns. The author's friend's partner accused them in a group message, and the friend's behavior makes the author feel hostile.\n\nFirst, the key points are:\n1. The author's personal belief doesn't align with genderfluidity but keeps it to themselves unless discussing it.\n2. The discussion happened when they were stoned, leading to an apology and affirmation of respect.\n3. The friend is perceived as being histrionic and has changed names multiple times without altering appearance or habits.\n4. The author avoids the group due to feeling hostility and the group's alignment with Tumblr's sensitivity.\n5. The author is being mocked for being less progressive compared to anti-SJW types.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author did express their disbelief once, under the influence, and apologized. They claim to respect their friends regardless of their personal beliefs. However, the friend's partner directly called out the author, suggesting they might be an issue. The author's actions of avoiding the group might be seen as discriminatory, even if it's due to discomfort with the friend's fluidity.\n\nBut the main issue is the initial statement. Even if the author apologized, making a statement against a friend's gender identity, even if personal, can be hurtful. The friend's partner is part of the group that's sensitive to such issues, which are common in progressive circles. The author's belief, while personal, might be seen as invalidating the friend's identity, which could lead to being ostracized. However, the author is also asserting their right to hold personal beliefs while supporting equal rights. The line between personal belief and respect for others' identities is thin here. \n\nThe author's actions of avoiding the group could be seen as a self-imposed consequence of their statement. But in a community that values such identities highly, the author's stance might be considered transphobic, even if they don't act on it. The key here is whether not believing in a gender identity is equivalent to being an asshole. The answer would likely lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because expressing disbelief in a friend's identity, even if done once and under influence, can be harmful and is seen as invalidating in many communities. The author's subsequent avoidance might be a result of feeling backlash, but the initial statement is the main issue.\n"
