Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not buying into their friend's genderfluidity, and there's some tension because of it.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they're pretty left-leaning and support equal rights, even if they disagree with certain beliefs. They say they don't really believe in genderfluidity but keep their thoughts to themselves unless discussing. Then, there's a situation where they were stoned and expressed their disbelief, leading to their friend's girlfriend calling them out and making them feel hostile towards the group. The author now faces jokes comparing them to anti-SJW types.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author doesn't believe in genderfluidity but respects their friends, had an argument while under the influence, and is now being judged by the group. The question is whether the author is in the wrong here.\n\nOn one hand, the author is honest about their beliefs and has apologized. They claim to respect their friends regardless. On the other hand, questioning someone's gender identity can be hurtful and is considered insensitive, especially if it's a core part of that person's identity. The author's friend might feel invalidated, which could explain the hostility. The author's admission of being under the influence and then apologizing might mitigate some of the blame, but the fact that they continue to avoid the group and hold onto their disbelief could still be problematic.\n\nIn many cases, even if someone's beliefs are personal, it's considered respectful to acknowledge others' identities, even if you don't personally agree. The author's friends might feel that by not buying into the genderfluidity, it's dismissive of their friend's identity. Even if the author respects them, not accepting their identity can still be seen as harmful. So, the author might be in the wrong because their disbelief, even if kept private, is causing hurt and division. The fact that the friend is changing names and identities could indicate that the issue is more complex than the author acknowledges. The author's avoidance and the group's reaction might stem from feeling disrespected, which the author's actions could contribute to.\n\nBut the author did apologize and claims to respect their friends. However, the ongoing conflict suggests that the apology wasn't enough. Maybe the problem is that the author's disbelief is a part of a broader attitude that's seen as invalidating. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're not accepting a friend's identity, which is a personal belief but can be hurtful. Alternatively, if the author is just expressing their view without attacking the person, maybe not. But in this context, questioning someone's gender identity is often considered disrespectful. So I think the answer is A.\n"
