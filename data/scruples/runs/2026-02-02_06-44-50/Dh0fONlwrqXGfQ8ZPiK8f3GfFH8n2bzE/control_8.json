Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not believing in genderfluidity but keeping it to themselves except when discussing, which happened when they were stoned. The friend's girlfriend called out the author in a group message, leading to some tension. The author avoids the group now because they feel hostility and the friends are being overly sensitive, comparing them to anti-SJW types.\n\nFirst, the author's main issue is their disbelief in genderfluidity. The key here is whether it's acceptable to hold personal beliefs while still respecting others' identities. Even if someone doesn't believe in a concept, they should respect others' self-identification. The author did express their disbelief once, under the influence, and then apologized. The friend's GF reacted strongly, which might have caused the author to feel targeted. However, the author's avoidance and the subsequent jokes about anti-SJW types might be problematic.\n\nThe author says they don't oppose equal rights despite disagreeing. That's a positive point. But the fact that they made a comment under the influence and it was called out might have led to the current situation. The friend changing names and identities could be confusing, but the author's judgment of the situation as \"histrionic\" might be dismissive.\n\nThe core question is whether holding a personal belief without acting on it is wrong. Since the author didn't enforce their view, just expressed it once and apologized, maybe they're not in the wrong. But the ongoing avoidance and making jokes about the group's sensitivity might make them the problem. It's a balance between personal beliefs and respecting others' feelings. The answer might hinge on whether the author's actions (apart from the initial comment) were hostile or dismissive.\n"
