Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about the author not buying into their friend's genderfluidity. The author is described as being very left-leaning and an atheist, so they probably support equal rights, but personally disagree with certain concepts like genderfluidity. \n\nFirst, the main issue seems to be the author's public disagreement or skepticism. The friend's partner sent a message to the group specifically calling out the author, implying they might be an asshole. The author mentions they only once expressed their disbelief, which was while they were stoned. They also apologized and affirmed respect for their friends regardless of their beliefs.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the author's private beliefs vs. their actions. Even though they don't believe in genderfluidity, they keep it to themselves unless discussing, which they did once under the influence. Then they apologized. The problem arises when the friend's partner is upset and the group is making jokes comparing the author to anti-SJWs. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The author's stance might be seen as invalidating someone's identity, which can be hurtful. However, the author is saying they respect the person regardless of their beliefs. The fact that they only mentioned their disbelief once and then apologized might mitigate some of the wrongdoing. But expressing disbelief in someone's identity, even if done once, can be seen as offensive, especially if the person is part of the group that's marginalized. \n\nAlso, the author is avoiding the group because of the hostility they feel, which could imply that the group is being overly sensitive. However, the partner's direct call-out and the subsequent jokes from others suggest that the group is taking the issue seriously. The author's personal beliefs vs. respecting someone's identity are at odds here.\n\nFrom a social perspective, respecting people's identities is crucial, even if you personally disagree. The author's public mention of their disbelief, even under the influence, could be seen as contributing to a hostile environment. Even if they apologized, the fact remains that they expressed a view that could harm the friend's feelings or self-perception. \n\nBut the author also states they don't oppose equal rights, so they're not bigoted. The conflict is between personal belief and social acceptance. The community might expect the author to respect the friend's identity regardless of belief, to maintain a supportive environment. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intent wasn't malicious (since they apologized and respect the person), the action of expressing disbelief in the friend's identity, even once, might be considered wrong because it can be hurtful and invalidating. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
