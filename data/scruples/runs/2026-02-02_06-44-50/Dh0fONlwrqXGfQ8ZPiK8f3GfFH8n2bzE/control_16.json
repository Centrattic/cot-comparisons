Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not buying into their friend's genderfluidity and some resulting conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author identifies as left-leaning and an atheist, supports equal rights. They mention not believing in genderfluidity but keeping it to themselves unless discussing. The friend in question is in a relationship with an MTF (male-to-female) person and the friend has become genderfluid, changing names, etc. The author was stoned when they mentioned not believing in genderfluidity, the friend's GF accused them, leading the author to avoid the group, feeling hostile towards their \"Tumblr\" sensitivity. The author apologized for hurting feelings but still feels targeted by jokes about anti-SJW.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nThe author's stance is that they don't believe in genderfluidity but keep it private unless discussing. However, they made a public comment (in a group message) under the influence, which was called out. The friend's partner thought the author was insinuating the friend was pretending to be trans. The author then distances themselves, leading to conflict.\n\nFrom a social perspective, even if the author personally doesn't agree with genderfluidity, publicly expressing doubt in a group where the friend is trying to share their identity can be hurtful. The friend's partner took it as an attack. The author's avoidance might be seen as isolating the friend further. The author did apologize, but their continued avoidance and the fact that they were under the influence might reduce blame? However, the act of not believing in someone's identity, even if kept private, can be hurtful when expressed, especially if it affects the friend's social interactions.\n\nBut the author claims they respect their friends regardless. The problem is the public statement and the subsequent avoidance. The friend's partner felt attacked, leading to the group being hostile towards the author? Or the author feels the group is hostile. The author is caught between their personal beliefs and social dynamics.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's public statement, even if under the influence, might be seen as invalidating the friend's identity. Even if the author is in a left-leaning community, challenging someone's identity can be problematic. The author's decision to not participate in the group might be seen as justified if they feel hostile, but perhaps the initial statement was the issue.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether expressing disbelief in someone's gender identity is wrong, regardless of personal beliefs. Many would argue that respecting someone's self-identified gender is important, even if one doesn't personally agree. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not supporting their friend's identity publicly, even if they keep it to themselves otherwise. The public expression of doubt, especially under the influence, might have been the catalyst for the conflict, making the author at fault.\n"
