Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking about a situation where someone is questioning their stance on genderfluidity and whether they're being an asshole (AITA) for not believing in it. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is left-leaning, atheist, and supports equal rights but doesn't personally believe in genderfluidity. They had a situation where a friend in a relationship became genderfluid, and the partner was concerned. The author was stoned when they expressed their disbelief, leading to some tension. The friend changed names multiple times and sometimes uses their birth name or refers to themselves as male. The author thinks the friend is being histrionic and avoids the group because they find the group's approach too sensitive (like Tumblr's culture). They apologized for their comment and respect their friends, though they disagree.\n\nNow, the main question: Is the author in the wrong? The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nIn many cases, respecting someone's identity is considered important, regardless of personal beliefs. Even if someone doesn't personally accept certain identities, they're generally expected to respect others' self-identification. The author did say they don't believe in genderfluidity, which might be offensive to the friend. However, the author mentions they apologized and said they respect their friends regardless. \n\nBut the problem here is that the friend's partner was upset, and others are making jokes comparing the author to anti-SJW types. The author's comment was under the influence, but they apologized. However, the ongoing avoidance of the group might be seen as dismissive or disrespectful, even if the author claims they respect them. \n\nIn terms of social norms, even if you don't personally agree with someone's identity, it's usually considered respectful to acknowledge their identity to avoid causing harm. The fact that the author's friend is struggling with their identity and the partner is concerned means that the author's skepticism might be contributing to a hostile environment. The author's actions (avoiding the group) could be seen as reinforcing the group's over-sensitivity, even if that's not their intention.\n\nOn the other hand, the author claims they are trying to be respectful despite their beliefs and only made the comment once. They apologized, which shows some accountability. The question is whether their initial statement was wrong regardless of their intentions. \n\nIn terms of social justice perspectives, the prevailing view is that gender identity is self-determined, and questioning it can be harmful. Even if the author's comment was a one-time thing and under the influence, it's possible that they are in the wrong for expressing disbelief, especially if it caused hurt feelings. The partner's reaction suggests that the comment was damaging. \n\nHowever, the answer also depends on whether the author's statement was a personal belief expressed in context, and if they are making an effort to respect others despite that. If the author is not actively opposing or mocking, just having a personal belief, it's a gray area. \n\nBut given the partner's concern and the friend's identity struggles, the author's disbelief might be seen as invalidating the friend's experience. So, even if the author isn't overtly hostile, their stance could be harmful. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because respecting others' identities is generally expected, even if you personally disagree. But I need to check if the author's actions went beyond expressing a belief and into harmful behavior. They did apologize, which is a sign of taking responsibility, but the ongoing avoidance might be seen as isolating the group, which could be problematic. \n\nAlternatively, if the group is being overly sensitive, the author might be justified in avoiding them. But the key point is whether the author's initial statement was wrong. Many communities would say that respecting someone's identity is non-negotiable, even if you don't personally accept it. So the author expressing disbelief, even once, might be considered wrong regardless of context. Hence, the answer is A.\n"
