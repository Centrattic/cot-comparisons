Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is someone who's usually very left-leaning, supports equal rights, and is an atheist. They were introduced to a group of friends, including a friend in a long-distance relationship with an MTF (male-to-female) trans person. Recently, the friend has identified as genderfluid. The author doesn't believe in the concept of genderfluidity but usually keeps their thoughts to themselves unless discussing it. \n\nOne time, while stoned, the author mentioned their disbelief in genderfluidity. The friend's GF then sent a message to the group specifically calling out the author, and in private, speculated that the friend is trying to be trans. The author's friend often slips up on their name and identity, hasn't changed appearance or habits, and has changed their name multiple times, sometimes using their birth name or identifying as male. \n\nThe author feels the friend is being histrionic and has avoided the group because of the hostility they feel. They mention the group follows an oversensitive, coddling Tumblr ethos. The author apologized for causing hurt feelings and affirmed their respect, but now others are making jokes comparing them to anti-SJW types.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Answer A (Yes) or B (No).\n\nLet's break it down. The author's main issue is with not believing in genderfluidity. Even though they're usually supportive of equal rights, they made a comment under the influence. The key points here are:\n\n1. The author expressed disbelief in genderfluidity, even though they typically keep such opinions private. They were under the influence and later apologized.\n2. The friend's partner called them out publicly and privately speculated they were trying to invalidate the friend's identity.\n3. The author now feels targeted and is avoiding the group, perceiving hostility from the group's oversensitivity.\n\nFrom a social perspective, gender identity is a sensitive topic. Even if someone has good intentions, questioning someone's identity, especially when they've publicly come out, can be hurtful. The author's comment, even if made in a private discussion and under the influence, might be seen as invalidating their friend's identity. The friend changing names and identities frequently could be part of their personal journey, and the author's skepticism might not consider the individual's experience.\n\nHowever, the author did apologize and stated they respect their friends regardless of their beliefs. The issue is whether their comment was a one-time slip or something more harmful. The friend's partner's reaction and the subsequent group dynamic might have escalated the situation. The author feels they're being unfairly compared to anti-SJW types, which is a common label used to dismiss people who critique certain social justice aspects.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the comment was a genuine mistake while stoned, and they apologized, maybe they're not entirely at fault. But if their disbelief in genderfluidity is leading to invalidating someone's identity, even if indirectly, that's problematic. The line between personal belief and respecting others' identities is crucial here. In many social contexts, respecting someone's self-identified gender is considered a baseline, regardless of one's personal beliefs. So, even if the author's intention was not to be harmful, their words might have been hurtful, and the fact that they didn't support their friend's identity could be seen as being in the wrong.\n\nBut the author also mentions they support equal rights and don't oppose them. The key is whether not buying into genderfluidity equals being an asshole. If the author is respectful and doesn't push their beliefs, maybe it's not their fault. However, the fact that their friend's partner called them out and the group is now targeting them suggests that the community's standards are that expressing such disbelief is harmful, even if it's a personal belief.\n\nSo, considering the social norms around gender identity and the impact of the author's words, even if they had good intentions, they might be in the wrong for expressing disbelief in a way that hurt their friend. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes).\n"
