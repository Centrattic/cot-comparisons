Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not buying into a friend's genderfluid identity.\n\nFirst, the author is described as left-leaning and an atheist who supports equal rights despite personal disagreements. They mention that they don't believe in the concept of genderfluidity but keep it to themselves unless discussing. However, during a stoned conversation, they voiced their disbelief, which led to conflict. The friend's GF accused the author of being hostile and possibly trying to invalidate the friend's identity. The author then distances themselves from the group, citing the environment as overly sensitive, and faces jokes comparing them to anti-SJW types.\n\nThe key points here are the author's public expression of disbelief, even under the influence, and the subsequent withdrawal from the group. While the author apologized and stated respect, the act of publicly questioning someone's identity can be hurtful, regardless of intent. Genderfluidity is a personal identity, and dismissing it can be seen as invalidating. The author's avoidance might also be seen as contributing to the tension.\n\nConsidering the context, even if the author respects the person overall, the act of refusing to acknowledge someone's identity can be harmful. The group's reaction, while maybe over-sensitive, is about feeling respected. The author's statement that they \"don't believe in the concept\" could be seen as a personal belief that's not being applied to the individual, which is a form of disrespect. So, the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong).\n"
