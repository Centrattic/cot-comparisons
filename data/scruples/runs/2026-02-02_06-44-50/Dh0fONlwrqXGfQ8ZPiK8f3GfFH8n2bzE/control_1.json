Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking for a judgment based on the scenario provided.\n\nFirst, the author admits they don't believe in genderfluidity but keep it to themselves except in discussions. They mention a situation where they were stoned and expressed this disbelief, which led to their friend's girlfriend (GF) calling them out in a group message. The GF thought the author was targeting their friend, who is genderfluid. The author then changed their behavior, apologized, and respected their friends despite their beliefs. However, the group seems to have reacted negatively, comparing the author to anti-SJW types.\n\nNow, considering the context, the author's main issue is their disbelief in genderfluidity. But they did apologize and affirm respect for their friends. The key points here are whether expressing personal beliefs, even if they're unpopular, is wrong when done respectfully and followed by an apology. Also, the fact that the friend is changing names and identities might complicate things, but the author is not directly attacking the person, just their beliefs.\n\nHowever, in social contexts, especially among friends, respecting others' identities is crucial. Even if the author disagrees, how they express that disagreement matters. The fact that they were under the influence and made a comment that hurt someone's feelings could be a point against them. Also, avoiding the group because of their sensitivity might be seen as a reaction, but it's not clear if they were justified in that avoidance.\n\nThe author might be in the wrong for expressing disbelief in a way that upset their friend's partner, even if they later apologized. But they did take responsibility. On the other hand, if they didn't directly attack the person and only discussed it in appropriate contexts, maybe not. The main question is whether holding and expressing such a belief, even if incorrect, is inherently wrong. In many discussions, people are encouraged to respect others' identities regardless of their personal beliefs. So, the author's stance might be considered wrong in terms of social acceptability, even if they apologized. Hence, answer A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No)? Hmm, but the author did apologize and respects their friends despite their beliefs. The comment was under influence and in context. Maybe B is the answer here because the author isn't directly attacking, just expressing disbelief and then making amends. However, the impact on the friend and the group's reaction might still make them the asshole. It's a bit tricky. I think the key is that the author's disbelief leads to hurt feelings and they were called out, but they did apologize. Depending on cultural norms, the author might still be seen as wrong for not accepting the friend's identity. So maybe A is the answer. But I'm not 100% sure.\n"
