Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again to understand the details.\n\nThe author is a left-leaning atheist who doesn't oppose equal rights but personally doesn't believe in genderfluidity. They were part of a group where a friend is genderfluid. The friend's girlfriend accused them of being unsupportive, and the author admitted to not believing in genderfluidity once, under the influence of being stoned. They apologized and clarified they respect their friends. However, they've been avoiding the group because they feel hostility and think the group is too sensitive, like Tumblr. Now they're being called out for being an anti-SJW, and they're asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's belief in genderfluidity is not aligned with their personal views, but they claim they don't oppose equal rights. They made their stance clear once, even if it was when stoned, and apologized. However, the friend's partner felt targeted, and the author now avoids the group due to differing views on sensitivity.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a social perspective, respecting someone's identity, even if you don't agree with it, is important. The author's refusal to acknowledge the friend's gender identity (genderfluid) might be seen as invalidating, especially when the friend is trying to navigate their identity. The fact that the author mentioned their disbelief in a group setting could have caused hurt feelings, and even though they apologized, the ongoing avoidance might be seen as not making amends or engaging with the group despite differences.\n\nOn the other hand, the author claims they don't oppose equal rights and respect their friends regardless. They might feel that their personal beliefs shouldn't be forced upon them, but in social contexts, especially when someone's identity is involved, there's an expectation to respect others' self-identified terms. The author's avoidance could be seen as a form of social withdrawal rather than confrontation, but it might also be considered an inability to accept the friend's identity, leading to the friend feeling unsupported.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, the principle of respect for persons includes respecting their autonomy and identity. Even if the author disagrees, the expectation in inclusive communities is to use the correct pronouns and names as per the individual's preference. The author's public statement about not believing in genderfluidity, even if made when stoned, could be damaging to the friend's sense of acceptance. The fact that the friend's partner was upset suggests that the author's comment had negative consequences.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions the group being overly sensitive, similar to Tumblr's \"over-sensitivity and coddling ethos.\" This might indicate the author is uncomfortable with the level of social sensitivity required, but that doesn't excuse not respecting the friend's identity. Social groups often have norms, and adhering to them is part of maintaining relationships.\n\nThe author's apology was important, but actions speak louder than words. Avoiding the group might be a way to avoid conflict but could be seen as not taking responsibility for the impact of their words. The friend changing names and identities might be part of their journey, and the author's histrionic comment about that could be dismissive.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author claims to respect their friends, their public disbelief in genderfluidity and subsequent avoidance might be seen as invalidating the friend's identity, leading them to be considered the asshole. The key factors are not respecting the friend's identity despite personal agreement and the impact on the friend's self-perception and the group dynamics.\n"
