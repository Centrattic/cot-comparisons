Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend identifying as genderfluid, and the author not buying into that concept. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author states they're not opposed to equal rights and keeps their disbelief private unless discussing it. The friend's partner reached out in a group message, specifically mentioning the author, which caused tension. The author mentions that the friend changes names and pronouns frequently, which they find histrionic. They've since avoided the group due to what they perceive as over-sensitivity.\n\nThe author admits to making a comment about not believing in genderfluidity while stoned, apologized, and respects their friends regardless. However, they face jokes comparing them to anti-SJW people. Now, the question is whether the author is wrong.\n\nLegal and ethical considerations: In many places, respecting someone's gender identity is part of anti-discrimination laws. The author's refusal to acknowledge the friend's genderfluid identity could be seen as disrespectful, even if they're not actively opposing rights. The friend's partner's message in the group might indicate that the friend feels their identity is important, and the author's comment about not believing in the concept could be hurtful despite the apology.\n\nSocial norms and empathy: Even if someone doesn't believe in a particular identity, it's generally expected to respect others' self-identification to avoid causing harm. The author's avoidance and the group's reaction suggest that their skepticism is causing strain in the relationship. The fact that they make jokes about others and compare themselves to anti-SJW people might contribute to a hostile environment, even if they're not the sole cause.\n\nThe author's position is that they don't believe in genderfluidity but don't oppose equal rights. However, the line between personal belief and respectful treatment is thin. Discrimination can occur not just through legal actions but also through social exclusion or disrespect. The author's behavior, even if not illegal, might be socially unacceptable and damaging to relationships.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is likely in the wrong because they are not respecting their friend's identity, which can be harmful, even if they're not malicious. The answer would be A.\n"
