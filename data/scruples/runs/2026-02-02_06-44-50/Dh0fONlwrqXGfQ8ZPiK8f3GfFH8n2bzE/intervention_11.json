Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not buying into their friend's genderfluidity. The author claims they don't believe in the concept but keep it to themselves unless discussing. They had a discussion while stoned, and the friend's GF accused them of being an asshole. The author now feels targeted with jokes comparing them to anti-SJW types.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is part of a group where two friends are in a relationship. One is MTF, the other is genderfluid. The author's stance is that they don't believe in genderfluidity but respect others' rights. The key points are the author's public statement (even if under the influence) and the subsequent actions. \n\nThe author mentions they said they don't believe in genderfluidity once, in context, and apologized. They also state they respect their friends regardless. However, the friend's GF took offense, and the group seems to be applying pressure. The author is avoiding the group due to hostility.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. The question is about belief versus respect. The author doesn't have to believe in someone's gender identity to respect their rights. However, by expressing disbelief, even if they later apologize, it might have caused harm. The friend changing names and identities could be a genuine struggle, and the author's comment might have invalidated their experience. \n\nBut the author claims they don't oppose equal rights. The issue is whether not buying into a concept is inherently wrong. If they're respecting the person's identity despite their personal beliefs, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, publicly stating disbelief, especially when it comes to someone's identity, can be hurtful. The author's avoidance might be a result of feeling targeted, but the group's reaction could be seen as over-sensitive. \n\nIn some contexts, expressing personal disbelief in a concept like genderfluidity, even if done respectfully, can be problematic because it dismisses the individual's lived experience. The author's admission that their friend is being histrionic might also be a judgment that's not theirs to make. \n\nBalancing free speech and the impact on others is tricky. The author might not be in the wrong if they are respecting their friend's identity privately, but the public statement and the resulting conflict might tip the scales. However, the friend's GF's reaction and the group's hostility could be excessive. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author expressed a personal belief in a context that led to conflict, but they did apologize and affirm respect. The wrongness might depend on the intent and the harm caused. If the author's statement caused harm and they didn't fully support their friend's identity, they could be in the wrong. But if they're respecting the person despite their beliefs, maybe not. I'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because even if they respect rights, expressing disbelief can invalidate someone's identity, especially in a social circle where that person is part of the group. The author's avoidance might be their way of distancing from the conflict, but the initial statement was disrespectful. So, answer A (yes, in the wrong).\n"
