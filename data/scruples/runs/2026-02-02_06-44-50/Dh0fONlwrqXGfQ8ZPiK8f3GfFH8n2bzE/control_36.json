Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not buying into their friend's genderfluidity. The scenario is presented as an AITA (Am I the Asshole) post.\n\nFirst, the author identifies as left-leaning, atheist, and supports equal rights. They mention they don't oppose equal rights even if they disagree. The main issue here is their disbelief in the concept of genderfluidity, which they keep to themselves except during discussions. \n\nThen, there's a situation where they made a comment (possibly under the influence) about not believing in genderfluidity. The friend's GF (girlfriend?) then publicly called out the author, implying they might be transphobic. The friend is changing names and identities frequently but hasn't changed appearance or habits. The author thinks the friend is being histrionic and has been avoiding the group because of the hostility. They apologized after the comment and respect their friends regardless. However, they're now being mocked as an anti-SJW.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of ethics and social norms, gender identity is a personal experience, and respecting someone's identity, even if you don't understand or agree, is generally considered respectful. The author's public expression of disbelief, even if they later apologized, could be seen as harmful or invalidating to the friend. Even if the author's intention was to express personal belief, the impact on the friend and the group dynamics matters. The fact that the friend is changing names and identities might indicate a genuine struggle with their identity, which the author is dismissing as histrionic, which is judgmental.\n\nHowever, the author claims they don't oppose equal rights and only expressed their disbelief in a discussion. They also mentioned being under the influence and apologized. The friend's GF might be overreacting, but the author's public stance could contribute to a hostile environment, even if unintended.\n\nIn many modern contexts, even if someone is questioning their identity, the focus is on supporting them rather than doubting their experience. The author's attitude might be seen as undermining the friend's journey, which can be hurtful. The fact that the group is following a \"Tumblr\" ethos suggests a high sensitivity around these issues, so the author's comment is likely to be perceived as negative in that environment.\n\nSo, while the author might not have intended harm, their disbelief expressed publicly and the subsequent avoidance of the group could be seen as being in the wrong. The key point is the impact on the friend and the group's perception, regardless of the author's intentions. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they expressed a belief that can be considered invalidating to someone who is exploring their gender identity, leading to tension and exclusion.\n"
