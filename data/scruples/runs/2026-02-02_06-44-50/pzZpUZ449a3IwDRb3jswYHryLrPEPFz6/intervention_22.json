Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through their situation again.\n\nThe author is 18 years old and obese with a BMI around 40. They live with their mom, who is also obese. The mom cooks big portions and buys a lot of chocolate. The author tried to tell the mom that her portion sizes and the availability of unhealthy food make it hard for them to control their eating. The mom's response is always \"you don't have to eat it,\" which isn't helpful. The author feels like the mom is partly responsible for their weight and tried to get support to lose weight together, but the mom refuses, saying her age makes it not matter. Now the author is doing their own thing and plans to lose weight after moving out in 4 years. They're asking if they're the asshole for thinking their mom is overfeeding them.\n\nHmm. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is trying to take responsibility for their health by addressing the environment. Since they live with their mom, the home environment is a factor. The mom has a role in creating that environment with large portions and unhealthy snacks. The author is asking for support, which is reasonable. The mom isn't providing the support, which can be expected in such situations. The author isn't blaming the mom entirely but acknowledging their own struggle with self-control. However, the mom's responses are dismissive. \n\nBut wait, does the author have the right to criticize their mom's eating habits? The mom's own health isn't the focus here, but the author is pointing out that the mom's actions contribute to their own weight issues. The author is seeking help, which is a valid request. The mom's responses are not helpful, so the author's frustration is understandable.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for thinking their mom is overfeeding them? Maybe not. They're trying to manage their health and have communicated their needs. The mom isn't cooperating, but that doesn't make the author wrong for trying to address it. However, the author should also recognize that their mom's habits might be part of a larger issue, including their own tendencies to overeat. But the author isn't blaming the mom entirely; they're just asking for support. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is 18, which is an adult age in many places, so they have a responsibility to take some control over their own habits. But living with a parent who's unhelpful can make that harder. The author is taking steps on their own, which is good. The question is whether it's fair to blame the mom. The author says they think the mom is partly responsible, which might be a valid perspective given the environment, but the mom isn't the sole cause. \n\nSo, in terms of the AITA aspect, the author is not in the wrong for trying to address the issue and seeking support. The mom's dismissive attitude is part of the problem. The author is taking steps where they can. Therefore, the answer is B (author not in the wrong).\n"
