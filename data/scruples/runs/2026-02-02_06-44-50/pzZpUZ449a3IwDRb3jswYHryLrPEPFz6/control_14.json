Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 18, obese with a BMI around 40, and lives with their mom. The mom is also obese. The author is trying to manage their weight but finds it hard because the mom makes huge portions and buys a lot of chocolate. When the author asks her to cut back, the mom responds with \"you don't have to eat it,\" but the author can't help themselves. The author feels the mom is partly responsible and tried to talk to her, but the mom blames them and won't consider losing weight. The author is now doing what they can on their own and plans to move out in 4 years.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The author is trying to address their health issues, which is a valid concern. They're not forcing their mom to do anything; they're asking for her help. The mom isn't cooperating, which is making the author's task harder. The author's frustration is understandable because they can't control their eating when the environment is filled with temptation. \n\nThe mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" dismisses the author's struggle. It's not the author's fault they have a hard time resisting, especially with their mom's habits. The author isn't blaming the mom entirely but is pointing out that the mom's actions contribute to the problem. The author is seeking support, which is reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom might argue that the author is an adult and should manage their own diet. But at 18, it's still a formative age, and family support is crucial. The author isn't asking for the mom to take over but to make small changes that could help. The mom's refusal to consider her own health and the author's situation seems unhelpful.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to improve their health and are seeking support from their mom, which is a reasonable request. The mom's lack of support and blame are part of the problem here.\n"
