Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is wrong. The author is 18, lives with their mom, and is obese with a BMI around 40. They want to lose weight but feel their mom's big portions and buying a lot of chocolate are making it hard. They've tried talking to her, but she just says \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author is frustrated because they can't control themselves and think the mom is partly responsible. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author is clearly struggling with their health and is trying to take steps to improve it. They're in a situation where their environment (the mom's cooking and shopping habits) is making it harder. The mom, on the other hand, isn't cooperating and is blaming the author for not controlling their eating. \n\nThe author is not the one making the unhealthy food choices; the mom is providing them. The author is trying to communicate their needs but is met with resistance. It's reasonable for the author to feel that they need help modifying their environment to achieve their health goals. The mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" ignores the author's stated inability to control themselves, which is a legitimate issue, especially with a BMI that high. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't at fault for wanting to improve their health. They're taking initiative to address their weight, which is a positive step. The mom's lack of support isn't helping, but the author isn't responsible for the mom's actions. The author's concern about the mom's health is there too, but the mom dismisses it. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is trying to do the right thing by seeking help and taking steps to lose weight. They're not the one creating the problem; they're trying to solve it despite the obstacles. The mom's behavior is enabling the unhealthy habits, but the author isn't in the wrong for pointing that out and seeking support. Therefore, the answer should be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
