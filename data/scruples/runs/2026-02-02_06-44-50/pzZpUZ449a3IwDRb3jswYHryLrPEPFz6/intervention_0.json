Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The author is 18 years old, obese with a BMI around 40, living with their mom who also cooks a lot of food and buys chocolate. The author feels their mom is overfeeding them and not helping with their weight loss. They tried talking to their mom, but she responds with \"You don't have to eat it,\" which the author finds unhelpful. The mom blames the author for their weight and isn't supportive. The author wants to lose weight and feels like their mom isn't helping, planning to move out in a few years.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if others agree. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is in the wrong. The author is trying to address their health issue, which is significant (BMI 40 is morbid obesity). They're asking for support from their mom, who isn't providing it. The mom's response is dismissive. The author is taking steps to manage their own health, which is positive. But maybe the author is being too direct or accusatory towards their mom? The author says they approached their mom kindly and calmly. The mom's behavior (large portions, buying lots of chocolate) could be contributing to the issue. \n\nThe author isn't blaming their mom entirely but is pointing out that their mom's actions make it harder for them to lose weight. The key here is that the author is taking responsibility for their own health but is also seeking assistance from their mom, which is reasonable. The mom isn't supportive and isn't helping, which is a problem. The author isn't in a position to force their mom to change, but they're trying to communicate their needs. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is often on whether the person's actions were unreasonable. The author is trying to address their health, which is a valid concern. The mom's response isn't helpful, but the author is not in the wrong for wanting support. They are taking steps to improve their situation despite the challenges. The author isn't blaming their mom in a harmful way but is seeking help. So the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
