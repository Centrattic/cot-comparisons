Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking their mom is overfeeding them. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is 18 years old, lives with their mom, and is obese with a BMI around 40. They mention that the mom also has obesity. The author has tried to communicate their struggles with portion sizes and unhealthy snacks, but the mom's response is always \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels they need help from their mom to manage their weight, but the mom isn't providing support and instead blames them. The author is planning to move out and take control of their diet then.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is at fault. The author is trying to address their health by cutting down on food, which is a responsible step. They've communicated their issues to their mom, who isn't supportive. The mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" implies a lack of understanding of the author's lack of willpower, which is a common issue with overeating. However, the author is still living with their mom and the environment provided by the mom is contributing to the problem. \n\nBut the author isn't asking for the mom to take responsibility for their actions directly. They're asking for support, which the mom isn't giving. The author's intention is to take steps to improve their health. While living with someone else, especially a parent, can be challenging when there are differing health goals, the author isn't making the mom's choices for her. They're trying to set boundaries to manage their own health. \n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The author might be placing some responsibility on the mom for their weight, which is a bit of a gray area. While the mom's habits do contribute, the author's own choices also play a role. But in this case, the author is clearly making an effort and seeking help, which is reasonable. The mom's lack of support is a barrier. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address the issue and seeking support. They're taking responsibility for their health, even though they're still in a situation where external factors (the mom's cooking and buying habits) are challenging. The key here is the author's intent to improve and their communication attempts, which are valid. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
