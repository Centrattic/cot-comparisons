Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author (who is 18) living with their mother, who is also obese. The author is struggling with their weight and feels that their mother's large portions and indulgence in unhealthy food are contributing to their obesity. The mother responds to the author's concerns by saying \"you don't have to eat it,\" which the author finds unhelpful. The author feels their mother is partly responsible for their weight and is frustrated because the mother isn't supportive in helping them lose weight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is an adult, but still living with their mother. The mother's behavior might be influenced by her own habits and possibly her own struggles with weight. The author is trying to take responsibility by wanting to make dietary changes, but feels hindered by the environment their mother creates. The mother's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" might be well-intentioned but not helpful because it doesn't address the author's lack of self-control in the presence of large portions and unhealthy foods.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. They are trying to make healthier choices but feel that their mother isn't cooperating, which makes it harder. The mother's refusal to consider changing her habits, even when offered the idea of losing weight together, might be contributing to the problem. However, the mother might also feel that she's being blamed unfairly. It's possible that the mother feels defensive because she's also dealing with her own weight issues and might not know how to support her son effectively.\n\nNow, determining if the author is in the wrong. The author is expressing their concerns calmly and trying to seek help, which is reasonable. They are not shaming their mother but asking for support. The mother's responses, while perhaps not malicious, are dismissive and not helpful. The author's actions in trying to make changes on their own are positive steps. However, the author might be placing some responsibility on the mother for their weight, which can be a sensitive topic. It's possible that the author's frustration is justified given the mother's lack of support, but maybe the author could approach the situation differently, such as setting boundaries when living together or seeking external support.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, the key points are about taking personal responsibility for their health while also seeking a supportive environment. Since the author is making efforts to change their habits and is not blaming the mother in a hostile way, it's more about the mother's lack of support. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The mother's behavior is contributing to the problem, but the author's actions are about self-improvement. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
