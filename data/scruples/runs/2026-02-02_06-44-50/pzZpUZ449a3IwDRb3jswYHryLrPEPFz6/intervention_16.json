Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is an 18-year-old living with their mom, who is also obese. The author feels that their mom is overfeeding them with huge portions and buying a lot of chocolate, which makes it hard for them to control their eating. They tried to talk to their mom about it, but she responds with \"you don't have to eat it,\" and when the author says they need help, the mom blames them and doesn't take responsibility.\n\nThe author is wondering if they're at fault here. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. I need to decide if the answer should be A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nFirst, let's consider the author's perspective. They're dealing with obesity and trying to address it by changing their diet. They live with their mom, who is also obese and makes large portions and buys unhealthy snacks. The author is struggling with self-control and has communicated their issues to their mom, but the mom isn't supportive. The author is trying to take responsibility by saying they'll work on it themselves once they move out. \n\nNow, from the mom's side, she might not see her actions as contributing to the problem. She might believe that the author has control over their eating habits. The mom's responses like \"you don't have to eat it\" suggest she's not acknowledging her role in making unhealthy food accessible. But as a parent, even if the child is an adult, she might still be in a position where her actions affect the child's ability to manage their health.\n\nThe author isn't blaming their mom directly but is pointing out that the mom's actions (overfeeding, buying unhealthy food) are part of the problem. The mom isn't cooperating, which makes it harder for the author to lose weight. The author is asking for support, which the mom isn't giving. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is trying to take steps to improve their health, which is a positive action. The mom's response is dismissive and not helpful. The author isn't in a position to control the food environment if they're still living at home, so asking for help is reasonable. The author isn't wrong for seeking support or pointing out the mom's unintentional contributions to their weight issue. \n\nThe key factors here are the author's effort to address the problem, the lack of support from the mom, and the author's intention to take action once they move out. Since the author is not at fault for wanting to improve their health and seeking help, the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
