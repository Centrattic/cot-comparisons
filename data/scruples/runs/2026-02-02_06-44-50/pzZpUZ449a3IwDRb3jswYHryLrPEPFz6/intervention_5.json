Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is an 18-year-old living with their mother, who's also obese. The main issue is that the mother makes large portions and buys a lot of unhealthy food, like chocolate. The author feels that this is contributing to their own obesity and has tried to talk to their mom about it, but she responds with \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author is asking if they're in the wrong for thinking their mom is overfeeding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is an adult, but still living at home. They have a BMI of 40, which is morbidly obese. They mention that they can't control themselves when food is available, which is a common issue with overeating. The mother, also obese, seems to not take their concerns seriously and blames the author for being unable to resist the food.\n\nThe key point is whether the author is in the wrong for holding their mother responsible. The mother's actions (big portions, buying unhealthy snacks) are contributing to an environment that makes it hard for the author to eat healthily. The author is trying to take steps to lose weight but feels unsupported. \n\nHowever, personal responsibility is a factor. Even though the mother's behavior is enabling, the author is an adult and has some responsibility in their own eating habits. But given that they have a hard time resisting, especially with a mother who's not helping, it's understandable that they feel the mother is part of the problem. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the mother isn't doing anything illegal, but she's not helping her child's health. The author's actions in speaking up are reasonable. They're not blaming the mother entirely but are pointing out that her actions make it harder for them. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because the author is seeking help and recognizing an environmental factor that's contributing to their weight, which is a valid concern. They're taking steps to improve but need support. The mother's response is dismissive, which isn't helpful, but the author isn't at fault for wanting a supportive environment.\n"
