Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for thinking their mom is overfeeding them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 18, obese with a BMI around 40, lives with their mom who is also obese. The mom cooks large portions and buys a lot of chocolate. The author has told their mom they can't help themselves with the food, but the mom responds with \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels that the mom is partly responsible for their weight and tried to talk to her, but she blamed them. Now the author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author is struggling with obesity, living with a parent who provides large portions and sweets, and feels unsupported. The mom's response is dismissive. The author is trying to take steps to lose weight but feels hindered by the environment.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to assess both sides. \n\nThe author's perspective: They're trying to address a health issue, which is serious. They're not in control of their eating habits in this environment. They've communicated their needs to their mom but aren't getting the support. They're not blaming the mom entirely but acknowledging their own struggle with self-control. \n\nThe mom's actions: She's providing food, which is her role, but in quantities and types that the author finds unhealthy. Her response is a common one where she implies the problem is the author's lack of willpower. However, she's not taking their concerns seriously, which can hinder the author's efforts.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for holding their mom accountable? Well, they\u2019re acknowledging their own part in not resisting, but the mom's environment is contributing. It's not the author's fault they have a hard time with self-control. They're seeking help, and the mom isn't supporting them, which is a valid concern. \n\nThe author isn't blaming the mom for their entire obesity but is pointing out that the mom's habits are making it harder. The mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" is dismissive and doesn't address the actual issue of the author's inability to control their eating when food is accessible. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is trying to take steps (like planning to move out) to create a healthier environment. They're not shaming the mom's weight but focusing on their own health. So, the author's actions seem reasonable. \n\nHowever, the user thinks the author is wrong. Maybe they see the author as overstepping by blaming the mom. But the author is expressing their needs, which is understandable. The mom might not realize the impact of her actions, but the author isn't at fault for that. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. They\u2019re seeking support and acknowledging their own challenges but are in a situation where they need help. The mom isn't providing it, but the author isn't responsible for the mom's lack of support. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
