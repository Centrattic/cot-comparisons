Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is obese, lives with their mom, and feels like their mom is overfeeding them. The mom makes big portions and buys a lot of chocolate, and when the author tries to tell her that this isn't helping, the mom responds with \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels responsible for their own weight but wants help from their mom, who's not providing it. The user thinks the author might be in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They have a BMI around 40, which is classified as severely obese. They mention health issues and a desire to lose weight. They live with their mom, who also has weight issues, and they feel that the mom's cooking and buying habits are contributing to their problem. The mom isn't supportive, brushing off their concerns and not helping them. The author is trying to take steps to lose weight but feels stuck because of their environment.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom might not be intentionally overfeeding them. She might not realize the impact of her actions or have her own struggles with weight. The phrase \"you don't have to eat it\" could be a way of giving autonomy, though it's not helpful here. The mom might also feel defensive if her child is blaming her for their weight, which could lead to conflict.\n\nThe key here is personal responsibility versus environmental factors. While the author's mom's habits might make it harder, the author is an adult (18 years old) and has the responsibility to make their own choices. They can choose not to eat the food offered, even if it's tempting. However, the author is struggling with self-control, which is understandable. The mom might not be providing the ideal environment, but the author's weight is ultimately their own responsibility.\n\nBut then again, the author is trying to communicate their needs and is not getting support. The mom could be more proactive in adjusting portions or offering healthier options. The author's frustration is valid because they need support to make healthy choices, and the mom isn't providing that. But does that make the author in the wrong for holding their mom accountable?\n\nAlso, the author is still living at home, so they might not be in a position to control their environment entirely. The mom's habits are creating a challenging environment for the author. However, the author is an adult and might be expected to take steps to manage their own health, such as eating separately or preparing their own meals.\n\nIn terms of AITA, the question is whether the author is wrong for blaming their mom. The author is seeking support and has tried to communicate, but the mom isn't cooperating. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting help. The mom might not be providing the support the author needs, but the author is also responsible for their own choices. The answer might depend on cultural norms or family dynamics, but the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address the issue. However, the author might be taking responsibility away from themselves by blaming the mom instead of focusing on their own actions. But given the environmental factors, it's a tricky situation.\n\nSo, putting it together: the author isn't in the wrong for feeling that their mom's habits are making it harder to lose weight, especially if they've communicated their needs. The mom isn't helping, which is a problem. However, the author still has control over their own eating choices. The author is taking steps to manage their weight despite the environment. So the answer is probably B (not in the wrong), but maybe there's a nuance. Alternatively, maybe the author should take more personal responsibility, making them in the wrong. But considering the mom's lack of support, the author isn't entirely at fault. The mom is part of the issue, so the author isn't in the wrong for pointing that out.\n"
