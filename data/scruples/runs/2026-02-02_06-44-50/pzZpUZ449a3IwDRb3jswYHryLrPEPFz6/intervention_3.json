Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author is 18 years old, lives with their mom, and is obese with a BMI around 40. They mention that their mom also cooks large portions and buys a lot of chocolate, even though the author has told her it's hard to resist. The mom's response is \"you don't have to eat it,\" but the author can't help themselves. The author then blames the mom for contributing to their weight issue and feels she's not helping them lose weight. The mom is also obese and dismisses the idea of losing weight because of her age. The author is now trying to do things on their own and plans to move out in four years, hoping to lose weight then.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. Let me analyze both sides.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: They're struggling with obesity and feel their mom isn't helping by making large portions and buying unhealthy snacks. They've tried to communicate their need for support but feel dismissed. They want to take responsibility but need environmental support. They're in a situation where their home environment is making it hard to eat healthily, and they're trying to address this with their mom. The author isn't blaming the mom directly but is pointing out that the mom's actions (or inactions) are contributing to their problem. They're seeking help, which they're not getting, so they feel justified in their stance.\n\nFrom the mom's side: She's allowing the author to have the food but is saying it's their choice whether to eat it. She might not see the issue with portion sizes or the presence of unhealthy snacks. She's also in denial about her own weight and doesn't want to consider changing her habits. Her response of \"you don't have to eat it\" implies a lack of understanding of the author's struggle with self-control. However, as a parent, she might not realize the impact of her actions on the child's health.\n\nNow, considering responsibility. The author is an adult (18) but still living with their mom. The author has a right to request a supportive environment for their health goals. However, the author is also responsible for their own choices. The mom might be enabling the problem by not adjusting her cooking and shopping habits, but the author is not a child anymore and could take steps to manage their own food intake, like preparing their own meals or not eating the portions made. However, the author mentions they can't help themselves, which suggests a lack of willpower or possible addiction to food, which complicates things.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for blaming their mom? Well, if the mom's actions are contributing to the problem, then the author isn't necessarily wrong to point that out. But if the author is also not taking active steps beyond just telling their mom, maybe they're not doing enough themselves. However, the author is making an effort to eat healthier now and plans to move out. The mom's dismissal of the issue could be part of the problem.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both have roles. The author is responsible for their own eating habits, but the environment created by the mom is making it harder. The mom isn't providing the support the author needs. However, the author could still take initiative to create a healthier environment for themselves, like not eating the portions made or finding alternatives. But the author's struggle with self-control complicates this. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I think not. The author is seeking help and has tried to communicate. The mom's refusal to acknowledge the issue is part of the problem. The author isn't to blame for the situation they're in, given their mom's role in the environment. Therefore, the answer would be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
