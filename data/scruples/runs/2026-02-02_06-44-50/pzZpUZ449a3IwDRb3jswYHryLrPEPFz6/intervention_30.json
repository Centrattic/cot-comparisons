Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking their mom is overfeeding them. The situation is that the author is obese with a BMI around 40, lives with their mom, and the mom cooks large portions and buys a lot of sweets. The author has tried to talk to their mom about this, but the mom responds by saying they don't have to eat it. The author feels the mom is partly responsible for their weight and has tried to get her help, but she's not supportive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is 18 and living at home. They're trying to manage their weight but struggle with self-control. The mom's response is to say they don't have to eat the food, which might not be helpful. The author is blaming the mom for contributing to their weight gain through the portions and the availability of unhealthy food.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, while the mom's actions (large portions, buying sweets) might make it easier for the author to overeat, the author is an adult. At 18, they're of age to make their own choices. However, the mom's behavior could be enabling if she's not considering the impact of her actions. But the author is asking if they're in the wrong for thinking the mom is overfeeding them.\n\nFrom a health perspective, it's reasonable for the author to want healthier habits. However, the mom's response is dismissive. The author's frustration is valid, but they also have agency. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding the mom responsible. The author's age is a factor\u201418 is young, and moving out might take a few years, but they still have some autonomy. \n\nThe mom's behavior isn't ideal, but the author's responsibility for their own health is also important. There's a balance here. The author might be right to seek support, but expecting the mom to change her habits because of their own health goals could be seen as placing undue responsibility on her. The mom isn't forcing them to eat; she's providing the food. So the author's choice to eat it is their own. However, the mom's actions make it harder for the author to manage their weight. \n\nIt's possible the author is not in the wrong for expressing their concerns, but the line between seeking help and blaming the mom might be thin. The key is whether the author is taking responsibility for their own actions. If they're acknowledging their self-control issues but also asking for support, that's reasonable. However, the mom isn't a doctor or a nutritionist, so expecting her to adjust her cooking for the author's health goals might be a stretch, especially if the author is an adult. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to address their weight and discussing it with their mom, but they might be overstepping by holding the mom responsible for their weight when the core issue is their own eating habits. The mom's response is unhelpful, but the author's autonomy and responsibility should be considered. So the answer is B (author not in the wrong) because their intention is to improve their health, and seeking support from family is reasonable, even if the mom isn't providing the needed support.\n"
