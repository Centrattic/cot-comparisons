Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's mother making large portions and buying a lot of chocolate, which the author can't resist eating. The author is obese (BMI ~40) and is trying to lose weight, but finds it hard to control themselves, especially with the mother's habits.\n\nThe author has tried talking to their mom about reducing portions and not buying so much chocolate, but the mom's response is \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels the mom is partly responsible for their weight and tried to get her to help with their weight loss, but the mom brushes them off. The author is now wondering if they're in the wrong for thinking the mom is overfeeding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the author's responsibility for their own eating habits versus the mother's role. The author mentions they have a hard time resisting the food their mom provides. But at 18, they are an adult, so there's a question of personal responsibility. However, living at home might make it harder to control their environment.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother's approach of not adjusting portion sizes or the availability of unhealthy snacks could be contributing to the problem. But does that make her \"overfeeding\" them? The term \"overfeeding\" implies that the mother is intentionally causing weight gain, which might be a stretch. The mother's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" suggests she believes the choice is up to the author.\n\nThe author is seeking help but feels the mother isn't providing it. But the author is also an adult, so they have the autonomy to make their own choices. They could take steps like preparing their own meals, eating elsewhere, or managing their own snacks. However, the author's struggle with self-control is a real issue, and the environment plays a role. But does that mean the mother is wrong for not changing her habits?\n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but they might be placing too much responsibility on their mother. The mother's behavior might not be malicious, but the author needs to take more agency in managing their own habits. However, the mother could be more supportive. The question is whether the author is wrong for thinking the mother is overfeeding them. Since the mother isn't forcing the author to eat, but the author's environment contributes, it's a shared dynamic. But the author's own choices are a factor. So maybe the answer is B (author not in the wrong) because the environment is a contributing factor, and the author is seeking to change that. However, there's also a personal responsibility aspect. Hmm.\n"
