Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong (AITA) for thinking their mom is overfeeding them. The author is obese with a BMI around 40, lives with their mom, and mentions that they struggle with self-control around food. The mom makes large portions and buys a lot of sweet treats, but when asked to cut back, she responds with \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels that the mom isn't helping despite their efforts to address the issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is an adult (18 years old) living with their mother. They have tried to communicate their needs, but the mother isn't cooperating. The key point is whether the author is at fault for holding the mother responsible for their weight. \n\nWeight management is a personal responsibility, but in a shared living environment, the mother's habits can certainly make it harder. The author isn't saying the mother is solely to blame but is asking for support. The mother's response dismisses the author's struggle, which might be unhelpful. \n\nHowever, the author is an adult and ultimately responsible for their own choices. While the mother's actions contribute to the environment, the author has the agency to make different choices. The question is whether it's fair to hold the mother accountable for the author's weight. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is on whether the person is in the wrong for their actions or statements. The author is expressing frustration and seeking support, not blame-shifting. They acknowledge their own self-control issues but are asking for help, which is reasonable. The mother's refusal to assist might be the bigger issue here.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They're seeking help and have communicated their needs. The mother's lack of support is a problem, but the author isn't at fault for wanting assistance. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
