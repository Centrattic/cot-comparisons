Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author feeling that their mother is overfeeding them, contributing to their obesity. The author is 18, living with their mom, who also has a weight issue. The author tries to control their eating but struggles, especially when the mom makes big portions and buys a lot of chocolate. The mom's response is \"you don't have to eat it,\" which the author finds unhelpful. The author tried to discuss this with the mom, but the mom blames them and refuses to consider dieting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is an adult (18), living with their parent. They're trying to manage their weight, which is a personal health issue. The mother's behavior, like making large portions and buying unhealthy foods, might be contributing factors. However, the author is responsible for their own choices. The mother might be enabling the behavior by not supporting the author's efforts.\n\nThe author's argument is that the mom isn't helping, and they feel the mom's actions are part of the problem. But is it the author's fault for not being able to control their eating? Or is the mom being unhelpful?\n\nIn terms of responsibility, while the mother's habits might influence the environment, the author as an adult has autonomy. The mother might not be obligated to change her cooking habits unless the author can set boundaries. However, the author is asking the mother for help, which is reasonable. The mother's refusal could be seen as not supporting the author's health goals.\n\nBut the author's approach in blaming the mother might not be the healthiest. They could take more personal responsibility. However, given that the mother isn't supportive, the author isn't entirely wrong to feel frustrated. The key is whether the author is in the wrong for holding the mother accountable. The mother's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" is dismissive, which isn't helpful. \n\nHealth-wise, the author's BMI is around 40, which is a serious health risk. The author is trying to address it, which is commendable. The mother's lack of support is a barrier. But does that make the author wrong for expressing frustration? Probably not. The author is seeking help and support, which is reasonable. The mother's refusal is the issue here, not the author's desire for assistance.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting the mother to adjust her habits to help with their weight loss. The mother is responsible for her own actions, but the author is also trying to take steps. The author's frustration is valid because they're not getting the support they need. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
