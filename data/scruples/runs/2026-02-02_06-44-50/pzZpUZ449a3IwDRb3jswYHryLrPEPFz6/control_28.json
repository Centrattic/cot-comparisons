Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is 18 years old, lives with their mom, and is obese with a BMI around 40. They mention that their mom also has a large portion size and buys a lot of chocolate, which they can't resist. The author has tried talking to their mom about reducing portion sizes and not buying so much chocolate, but the mom's response is always \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels that the mom is partly responsible for their weight and has even tried suggesting they both lose weight, but the mom dismisses it by saying her age doesn't matter. The author is now trying to manage on their own and plans to move out in four years.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is wrong. From the author's perspective, they are trying to take control of their health but feel unsupported by their mother, who is contributing to the problem by providing unhealthy portions and snacks. The mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" seems dismissive and not helpful, especially since the author has admitted they struggle with self-control. The author is seeking support, which is reasonable, especially in a household where the parent is also obese, possibly indicating a family environment that doesn't prioritize healthy eating habits.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom's response might be coming from a place of not wanting to restrict her child's autonomy. However, in this case, the author has explicitly asked for help because they can't control their eating habits on their own. The mom's repeated dismissal could be seen as not taking the author's health concerns seriously. The author isn't blaming the mom entirely but is pointing out that the environment contributes to their overeating. It's a common issue where the home environment plays a role in eating behaviors, especially when there's a lack of support for healthier choices.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their needs and pointing out that their mom's habits are making it harder for them to manage their weight. The mom isn't providing the support the author needs, which is a valid issue. The author's intention is to improve their health, and seeking help from someone they live with is reasonable. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
