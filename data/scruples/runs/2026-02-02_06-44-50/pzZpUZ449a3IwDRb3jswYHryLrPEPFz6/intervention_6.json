Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author, an 18-year-old, feeling that their mom is overfeeding them, contributing to their obesity. The author has a BMI of around 40 and is concerned about their health.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is still living with their mom, and the mom is also obese. The author feels that the mom's large portions and buying a lot of unhealthy food (like chocolate) are making it hard for them to control their eating. They've tried talking to their mom, who responds with \"you don't have to eat it,\" which the author points out doesn't help because they struggle with self-control.\n\nThe author is blaming the mom for their weight issue, but the mom blames them for not eating. The author feels unsupported and wants help but isn't getting it. Now, the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Well, the author is trying to address their health concern, which is valid. They are taking steps to lose weight and have communicated their feelings to their mom. The mom's response is dismissive, which isn't helpful. However, does the author have the right to blame the mom for their own eating habits? Even though the mom's actions make it harder, the author is an adult (18 years old) and responsible for their own choices. The mom might not be intentionally causing harm, but she's not supporting the author's goals. But the author is not entirely in the wrong because they are seeking help. The key here is that while personal responsibility plays a role, the author is at a vulnerable age and might need more support. The mom's response is ineffective, but the author isn't wrong for wanting that support. So the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
