Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who is 18 and obese, lives with their mother, who also has a significant weight issue. The author is struggling with overeating, especially when their mom makes large portions and buys a lot of chocolate. They've tried to communicate that they can't control themselves and that the mom's habits are contributing to their weight, but the mom responds with \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels unsupported and is considering moving out to take control of their diet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is taking responsibility for their own health by trying to eat better, but they're in an environment that's making it hard. The mother isn't providing the support they need, even when asked. The author isn't blaming the mom for their entire weight issue but is pointing out that the mom's actions are making it harder to control their eating. The mom's response is dismissive, which is a common issue in family dynamics where health habits are concerned.\n\nNow, looking at the question: is the author in the wrong? Well, the author is seeking help and has tried to communicate their needs calmly. They're not demanding the mom to fix everything but want some support. The mom's refusal to help and her dismissive attitude might be the issue here. The author isn't doing anything wrong by wanting to improve their health and asking for assistance. Even if the mom isn't directly causing the author's obesity, the environment definitely plays a role, and the author is justified in wanting that to change for their benefit.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), because the author is not in the wrong. They're trying to address a real problem and their needs are valid. The mom is not supporting them as requested, which is the crux of the issue here.\n"
