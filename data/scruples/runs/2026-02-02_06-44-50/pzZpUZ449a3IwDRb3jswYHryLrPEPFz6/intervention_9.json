Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is that they live with their mom, who cooks big portions and buys a lot of chocolate. The author is obese and feels their mom is contributing to their weight by overfeeding them. They tried to talk to their mom, but she just says \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author is frustrated because they can't control themselves and think the mom is partly responsible. The mom blames them and doesn't want to change her habits.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is unsure.\n\nFirst, considering the author's perspective: They're trying to manage their weight, which is a health issue. They're living with a parent who's not supportive of their goals. The author is seeking help and trying to communicate their needs. It's reasonable for someone to want to improve their health, especially with a BMI over 40, which is severely obese. The mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" might be dismissive and not helpful, given the author's struggle with self-control. So the author is not entirely at fault here.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is an adult (18 years old) and responsible for their own choices. While the mom's behavior might make it harder, the author still has the autonomy to make decisions. However, self-control issues can be a real problem, and it's not entirely their fault if they have a hard time resisting. Also, the mom's refusal to support or make changes could be seen as not helpful. But is the author in the wrong for attributing part of the problem to their mom? They're not blaming her entirely, just acknowledging her role in the situation.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is taking steps on their own now and planning to move out. They're not shifting all the blame but are seeking support. The mom's response is unhelpful, but the author's frustration is understandable. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way. They're trying to address their health and are honest about the challenges they face.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). They're seeking help and acknowledging their mom's role without entirely blaming her. The mom's lack of support is a significant factor here.\n"
