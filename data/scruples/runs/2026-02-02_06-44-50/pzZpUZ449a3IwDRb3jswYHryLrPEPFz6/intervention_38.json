Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The author is 18, living with their mom, and has a BMI around 40, which is in the obese category. They're trying to lose weight but find it hard because their mom prepares large portions and buys a lot of chocolate. The author has communicated their struggle to their mom, but the mom's response is to say \"you don't have to eat it,\" and when the author suggests they both lose weight, the mom dismisses it by mentioning her age. The author is wondering if they're in the wrong for feeling that their mom is overfeeding them and contributing to their obesity.\n\nFirst, the author's actions. They've tried to talk to their mom kindly and calmly, explaining their difficulty in controlling their eating. They're not just blaming the mom without trying to communicate. The mom's responses are dismissive and not helpful. The author isn't saying the mom is the sole cause but is pointing out that the environment (big portions and access to high-calorie snacks) makes it harder. The mom's refusal to adjust portions or support the author's efforts could be seen as not being supportive, especially since the author is trying to make changes.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, having a home environment that's not supportive can hinder someone's efforts to lose weight. The author isn't in the wrong for needing that support. The mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" assumes a level of self-control that the author is struggling with. It's similar to someone trying to quit smoking and the environment offering easy access to cigarettes. The author is asking for a supportive environment, which is reasonable.\n\nHowever, the author is also an adult (18) and could be taking more personal responsibility. But given that they're still living at home and the mom's role in providing meals, it's a shared responsibility dynamic. The mom's age argument is a bit weak if the author is also concerned about their health. The author's plan to move out and manage their diet then is a step, but they're not entirely at fault for seeking help in their current situation.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They've communicated their needs, are trying to make changes, and the mom isn't providing the necessary support. The author's frustration is valid. The answer should be B.\n"
