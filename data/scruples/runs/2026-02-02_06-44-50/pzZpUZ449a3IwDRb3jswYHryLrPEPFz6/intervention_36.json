Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author living with their mom, who makes big portions and buys a lot of chocolate, which the author can't resist. The author is obese, has a BMI of around 40, and wants to lose weight. They've tried to talk to their mom about the portions and the chocolate, but she tells them they don't have to eat it. The author feels that the mom is partly responsible for their weight and tried to get her to help, but she blames them instead. The author is considering moving out to lose weight.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious for another opinion. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is 18 and living with their mom. The author's mom makes large portions and buys a lot of chocolate, which the author can't control themselves around. The author has communicated their issues to their mom, who isn't supportive and instead blames the author for not controlling their eating. The author is trying to take steps on their own but feels the environment isn't helping.\n\nThe author's request is about whether they're in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLooking at the situation, the author is seeking help to manage their weight, which is a health issue. They've tried to approach their mom about the portion sizes and the availability of unhealthy food. The mom's response is dismissive, telling them not to eat if they don't want to, which doesn't address the author's self-control issues. \n\nThe author's actions here are about trying to improve their health by addressing environmental factors that make it hard. They're not blaming the mom entirely but are pointing out that the environment isn't helping. The mom's behavior is contributing to the problem, making it harder for the author to control their eating. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for feeling that the mom's actions are contributing to their weight? Well, the author is taking responsibility by trying to lose weight but is asking for support. The mom's refusal to adjust portions or limit unhealthy food could be seen as not providing a supportive environment. However, the author is not forcing the mom to change; they're suggesting changes that would help them. \n\nThe author isn't forcing their mom to cook or buy the chocolate. They're advocating for their health needs in a shared living situation. The mom, on the other hand, isn't willing to accommodate these needs, which is a common issue in such family dynamics. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's weight is a personal health issue, but environmental factors can influence it. The mom's actions are creating an environment that makes it harder for the author to control their eating. The author is not in the wrong for pointing out this influence and seeking support. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't at fault here. They're trying to improve their health and have communicated their needs, which is reasonable. The mom's response is the issue, but the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their needs and feeling that support is necessary.\n"
