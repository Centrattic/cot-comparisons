Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author, who is 18 and obese, living with their mother. The mother also has weight issues and makes large portions of food. The author is trying to control their weight but struggles because the mother doesn't listen when they ask for smaller portions or to avoid buying certain foods. The mother's response is always \"you don't have to eat it,\" even though the author can't help themselves. The author tried to get the mother to help them both lose weight but she dismissed it, saying her age makes it irrelevant. Now the author is managing on their own and plans to move out to tackle the issue.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author is trying to manage their health, which is a valid concern. Obesity is a serious health issue, and taking steps to address it is responsible. The author is communicating their needs to their mother, which is appropriate. However, the mother isn't cooperating, which is frustrating for the author. \n\nThe key points are: the author is seeking help from their mother to create a supportive environment for their health goals. The mother isn't providing that support and instead is making it harder by making large portions and buying unhealthy foods. The author isn't forcing the mother to do anything; they're just asking for assistance. The mother's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" ignores the author's self-control issues. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to take control of their health and asking for support. The mother is the one not accommodating the author's needs. The author's frustration is understandable, especially since they're trying to address a serious problem. They aren't blaming the mother entirely but are trying to find a solution. The answer here would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they're taking responsibility for their health and asking for reasonable help, which the mother isn't providing.\n"
