Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for thinking their mom is overfeeding them. The scenario involves the author living with their mother, both being obese, and the mother making large portions and buying a lot of chocolate. The author struggles with self-control and has tried to talk to their mom, who responds with \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels the mother is partly responsible for their weight and is frustrated because the mother doesn't support their weight loss efforts.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is 18, obese, and living with their mother. They have a problem with overeating, especially when there's a lot of food available. The mother, who is also obese, doesn't reduce portions or the amount of unhealthy food, despite the author's requests. The author feels the mother is contributing to their obesity, but the mother blames the author for not controlling themselves.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding the mother responsible. To determine this, I should evaluate both sides. On one hand, the mother's actions (large portions, buying lots of chocolate) might make it harder for the author to control their eating. The author's argument is that the mother's behavior is enabling their overeating. On the other hand, the mother might argue that the author is an adult and responsible for their own choices. The mother's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" suggests she believes the author has control over their eating habits, even if they admit they struggle with self-control.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, while the mother's actions could create an environment that's not conducive to weight loss, the author is an adult and has agency. However, the author is in a vulnerable position, possibly lacking the self-control they need, and the mother's behavior might be a contributing factor. It's a complex situation where both parties have their perspectives.\n\nBut the core issue is whether the author is in the wrong for thinking the mother is overfeeding them. The author isn't directly blaming the mother for their entire weight problem but is acknowledging that the mother's actions make it harder for them to manage their eating. The mother's response is dismissive, not supportive, which could hinder the author's efforts.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's common for families to have differing views on health and eating habits. The mother might not see her actions as problematic, especially if she's also struggling with her weight. However, the author's concern is valid because environmental factors do play a role in eating behaviors. The key is that the author is seeking support, which the mother isn't providing, leading to frustration.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They are trying to address a legitimate issue with their health and environment. The mother's lack of support is a problem, but the author's desire for a more supportive environment is reasonable. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
