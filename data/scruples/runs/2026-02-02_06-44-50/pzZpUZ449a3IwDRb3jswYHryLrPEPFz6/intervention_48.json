Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The author is 18, obese with a BMI around 40, lives with their mother who's also obese. The mom cooks big portions and buys a lot of chocolate. The author tries to tell the mom that her overfeeding is contributing to their weight issues, but the mom responds with \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels like the mom isn't helping and is even being blamed for not controlling themselves.\n\nHmm. The author's main issue is that they can't control their eating when the mom provides so much food, especially unhealthy stuff. The mom isn't taking their concerns seriously. The author is trying to lose weight and feels unsupported. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they're trying to address a health issue. They're not the one making the mom cook or buy the chocolate. The mom's response is dismissive. The author is taking responsibility by saying they want to lose weight but need help. The mom isn't cooperating. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. They're seeking support in a healthy way. The mom is the one not providing that support. The author's actions seem reasonable given their situation. They want to change their lifestyle but are facing obstacles from their environment. So I think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. The mom is the one who needs to adjust her behavior to support her child's health goals.\n"
