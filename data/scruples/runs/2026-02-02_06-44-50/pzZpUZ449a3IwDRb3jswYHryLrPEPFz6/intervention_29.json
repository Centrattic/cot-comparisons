Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is about the author, who is 18 and obese, living with their mom. The mom cooks huge portions and buys a lot of chocolate, and the author feels the mom is overfeeding them. The author tried to talk to the mom, but the mom blames them and says \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels the mom is partly responsible for their weight and is frustrated because the mom isn't helping them lose weight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is an adult, even though they're still in their teens. At 18, they are legally an adult, so they have some responsibility for their own choices. However, they live with their mom, and the mom's habits might be making it harder for them to control their eating. The author has mentioned their inability to resist eating the portions their mom makes, which suggests a lack of self-control or maybe even a compulsion they're struggling with.\n\nThe mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" is a classic parental response that might not be helpful. It could be seen as dismissive, not addressing the underlying issue that the author has trouble resisting the food. The mom's refusal to help and her own obesity might indicate that she's in denial about her role or doesn't see the problem. However, she's also an adult, and her eating habits are her own choice, but she might not realize how her actions affect her child.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. They want support to lose weight, but the mom isn't providing it. The author is taking steps on their own now, which is positive. The question is whether the author is at fault for thinking the mom is overfeeding them. \n\nOn one hand, the author is an adult and should have some autonomy. They could make their own meals or choose what to eat from the portions provided. But if the environment is contributing to their overeating, it's fair to ask for support. The author's problem is a personal health issue, and the mom's cooking habits are part of that environment. The mom might not be doing it intentionally, but the impact is there.\n\nBut the author's age might play a role. Even though they're 18, they might still be in a phase where they're learning adult responsibilities. Their self-control is being tested, and they're asking for help. The mom's response of blaming the author could be seen as not supportive. However, the author might need to take more responsibility for their own choices, like eating what they want even if it's there. \n\nSo, who is in the wrong? The author's situation is complex. They are trying to address their obesity, which is a significant health issue. The mom's actions are creating an environment that's making it harder for the author to manage their diet. The author is not wrong for seeking support; in fact, they're trying to be proactive. The mom's dismissal is unhelpful, but the author's situation is a personal health journey. They might not be in the wrong for wanting help, but they do have some responsibility for their own eating habits. However, the main issue is the mom's lack of support. The author is not wrong for feeling this way; the problem lies in the mom's response and lack of assistance. So, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
