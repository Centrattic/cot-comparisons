Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the question (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, their mother, and issues around overeating and obesity. \n\nFirst, the author is 18, living with their mom, and has a BMI of around 40, which is in the obese range. They mention that their mom is also obese and cooks large portions, including unhealthy foods like chocolate. The author has tried to communicate their struggles with overeating and asked their mom to reduce portion sizes or buy less tempting food. The mom's response is to tell the author they don't have to eat it, even though the author admits they can't control themselves.\n\nThe key points here are the author's health concerns and their attempts to get support from their mom. The mom isn't providing the help they need and instead blames them. The author is trying to take steps on their own but feels they'll only be able to make progress once they move out. \n\nNow, considering responsibility: The author is taking initiative to address their health, which is a positive step. They are being honest about their inability to control eating when unhealthy food is present in large quantities. The mom's response is dismissive, not helpful, and doesn't acknowledge the author's request for support. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking help or pointing out how their mom's actions (or lack thereof) are impacting their ability to manage their weight. The mother's refusal to adjust her cooking and buying habits makes her at least partially responsible for not supporting her son's efforts. The author's frustration is valid given the situation. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they are taking responsibility for their health and have reasonable requests for support, which the mother isn't providing. The author isn't at fault for wanting to improve their situation or for pointing out the mother's role in making it difficult.\n"
