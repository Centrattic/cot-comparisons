Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about their mom's cooking leading to their obesity, and the author feels their mom is overfeeding them. The author is 18, living with their mom, and has a BMI of around 40. They've tried to talk to their mom about portion sizes and buying chocolate, but the mom keeps saying \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels their mom is partly responsible and wants help, but the mom blames them and refuses to join in any weight loss efforts.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The author's argument is that their mom's behavior contributes to their obesity. The mom's response is to blame the author for not having self-control. The author is trying to address their health issue by asking for support from their mom. \n\nFrom a health perspective, the author has a valid concern. Obesity can lead to serious health issues, and seeking support from family is reasonable. The mom's response, which is to not take responsibility and instead deflect blame, might not be helpful. The author is trying to take steps to improve their health, which is positive. However, the author is still living with their mom and might not have control over the environment. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the author is trying to communicate their needs and is taking responsibility by saying they can't help themselves. The mom's actions are contributing to the problem, but the author is acknowledging their own role by saying they can't control themselves. The question is whether the author is wrong for feeling that their mom is overfeeding them. \n\nThe author's actions (talking to the mom kindly, trying to get help) seem reasonable. The mom's behavior is the problem here. The author isn't forcing the mom to cook large portions or buy chocolate; they are expressing their needs. The author's desire to take control of their health once they move out is proactive. \n\nSo, based on this analysis, the author is not in the wrong. They are seeking support and taking steps to address their health. The mom's response is the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
