Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author living with their mother, who cooks large portions and buys a lot of chocolate. The author is obese and trying to lose weight but finds it hard to resist the food. They've told their mom about the issue, but the mom responds with \"you don't have to eat it,\" and when the author suggests they both lose weight, the mom dismisses it because of her age.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is trying to manage their weight and is in a difficult situation where their environment (the mother's cooking and habits) is making it harder. They're seeking support but aren't getting it. On the other hand, the mother might not see her actions as contributing to the problem, thinking that the responsibility lies solely with the author to control their eating.\n\nFrom a health standpoint, having a supportive environment is crucial. If the mother isn't providing that support, it's a barrier for the author. However, does the author have any responsibility here? Well, they are an adult (18 years old) and could take steps to manage their own eating habits, like preparing their own meals or eating separately. But living with a parent who doesn't support healthy habits can be really challenging. The mother's refusal to acknowledge her role might be part of the issue here. \n\nThe author isn't blaming the mother unfairly; they're asking for help, which the mother isn't offering. The mother's responses are dismissive and not helpful. The author's frustration seems valid because they're trying to make positive changes but are being hindered by their environment. \n\nI think the key here is that the author is in a position where they need support but aren't getting it. The mother's behavior is enabling overeating, and the author isn't in the wrong for wanting that support. They are taking steps on their own, but the situation is tough. So the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
