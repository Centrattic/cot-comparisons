Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is 18 years old, lives with their mom, and is obese with a BMI around 40. They're trying to lose weight but struggle with their mom's cooking. The mom makes big portions and buys a lot of chocolate, and when the author tells her this is a problem, the mom responds with \"Well you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels the mom isn't helping and is even blaming them for their weight. The author is asking if they're at fault (AITA).\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the situation. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is an adult (18) but still living with their mom. They have a health issue (obesity) and are trying to address it. The mom is also obese. The problem is that the mom's cooking habits\u2014large portions and unhealthy snacks\u2014are making it harder for the author to manage their weight. The author has communicated this to the mom, but the mom isn't supportive, telling the author they don't have to eat it, which isn't helpful given the author's self-control issues.\n\nThe author is trying to take steps themselves but feels they need help. The mom, instead of supporting, is being dismissive. The author feels the mom is partly responsible. The key points here are the author's attempts to communicate their needs and the mom's lack of support.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't the one making the large portions or buying the chocolate. The mom's actions are creating an environment that's challenging for the author's health goals. The author is trying to take initiative but is hindered by the mom's behavior. The mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" ignores the author's lack of willpower in that situation. So, the mom isn't helping, but the author is trying to take responsibility for their own health.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? They're trying to address a health issue and have asked for help. The mom is not cooperating. The author isn't causing the problem; they're dealing with a situation created by the mom. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The question is whether the author is at fault for thinking the mom is overfeeding them. Since the author is trying to manage their health and the mom's habits are an obstacle, the author's concern is valid. The mom's refusal to support the author's efforts is the main issue here. Therefore, the author isn't wrong for wanting help to address a problem caused by the mom's actions. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
