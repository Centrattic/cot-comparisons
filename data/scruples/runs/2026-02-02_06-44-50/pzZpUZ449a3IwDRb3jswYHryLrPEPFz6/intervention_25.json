Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is 18, lives with their mom, and is obese with a BMI around 40. They're trying to lose weight by controlling their diet but find it hard because their mom makes big portions and buys a lot of chocolate. The mom's response is always that they don't have to eat it. The author tells their mom they think she's partly responsible for their weight, but the mom blames them instead. The author wonders if they're in the wrong for thinking this.\n\nHmm. The key here is whether the author is in the wrong for holding their mom accountable. On one hand, the mom is cooking and buying food that contributes to the author's overeating. The author can't control their own eating when faced with those triggers. So it's reasonable for the author to ask their mom to help, like smaller portions or less chocolate. On the other hand, the author is an adult (18 years old), and while they still live with their mom, they have some responsibility for their own choices. However, the author clearly states they struggle with self-control. \n\nThe mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" is dismissive. She's not considering the author's struggle with self-regulation. The author isn't blaming the mom entirely but is asking for support. The mom's refusal to acknowledge her role might be part of the problem. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. They're seeking help in a situation where their environment is making it hard to control their eating. They're trying to take steps to change, but their mom isn't supporting them. The mom's response is not helpful. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
