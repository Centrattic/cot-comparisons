Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation with their mom.\n\nSo the author is 18, obese with a BMI around 40, still living with their mom who cooks big portions and buys a lot of chocolate. They can't control themselves when food is around, and they've told their mom this before. The mom's response is always \"you don't have to eat it,\" which the author finds unhelpful. The author tried to talk to their mom about being partially responsible for their weight, but the mom blames them and doesn't see the issue. The author wants to lose weight and thinks moving out will help.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The author is taking steps to address their weight, which is positive. They've communicated their struggles to their mom, but the mom isn't supporting them. The mom's response seems dismissive and not helpful. The author isn't forcing their mom to cook or buy those items; they're asking for help. The mom isn't wrong in her actions, but she's not providing the support the author needs. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting help or pointing out that the environment isn't helping. They're taking responsibility by trying to change themselves, but that doesn't mean they're wrong to seek support. The mom's lack of support isn't the author's fault. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
