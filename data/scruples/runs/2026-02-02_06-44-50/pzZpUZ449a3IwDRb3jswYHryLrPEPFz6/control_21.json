Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is obese and lives with their mom, who also has a high BMI. The mom cooks big portions and buys lots of chocolate, even though the author is struggling with overeating. The author tried to talk to the mom about this, but the mom keeps deflecting by saying \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels that the mom is partly responsible for their weight and is frustrated.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The author is trying to address a problem they have with their mom's cooking habits contributing to their obesity. They're not blaming the mom entirely but are saying that the environment at home makes it hard for them to control their eating. The key here is that the author is taking responsibility for their own eating habits but is also asking for support from their mom. The mom isn't being supportive and instead is dismissive.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is trying to improve their health and is seeking help, which is reasonable. The mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" might be well-intentioned, but it's not helpful because the author has admitted they can't control themselves. So the author is not in the wrong for wanting the mom to adjust her behavior to help them. It's about creating a supportive environment. The author isn't blaming the mom for their entire weight issue but is acknowledging that the home environment plays a role. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
