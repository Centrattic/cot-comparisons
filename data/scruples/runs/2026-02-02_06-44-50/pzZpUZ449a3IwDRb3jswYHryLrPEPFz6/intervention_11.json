Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The author is 18, lives with their mother, is obese, and feels that their mom's overfeeding is contributing to their weight. They've tried to talk to their mom about portion sizes and buying certain foods, but she responds with \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author is frustrated because they can't control themselves and feels unsupported.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that they're struggling with weight and need help from their mom, but she's not providing support. They feel blamed instead. The mom's response is typical of a common defense mechanism where people say you can control your own actions. But in reality, if someone is in an environment with constant temptation, it's harder to control their eating habits. The author isn't blaming the mom for their entire weight issue but is saying that the mom's actions contribute. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they're seeking help, which is understandable. However, maybe they could be more proactive in their own health. But considering their age and living situation, it's reasonable to ask for some support. The mom's response isn't helpful, and it's possible the author is trying to take steps while living in an environment that's not supportive. \n\nBut wait, the author is 18 and planning to move out. They are aware they need to manage their health. The mom is also obese, so maybe there's a family pattern here. The author isn't necessarily wrong to ask for a supportive environment. However, maybe the author should focus on their own actions instead of blaming the mom. But the mom's response is dismissive, so the author's frustration is valid. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, while the author is an adult, they're still dependent on their mom for meals. They're trying to address the issue but are met with resistance. The key point is that the author is trying to get help, which isn't unreasonable. The mom's attitude of \"it's your choice\" ignores the reality of addiction or lack of self-control, which is a known issue. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking support. They're in a tough spot, but their intentions are to improve their health. The mom's response is the problem here. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
