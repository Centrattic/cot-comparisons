Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation with their mom. The author is obese with a BMI around 40, lives with their mom, and is struggling with overeating because the mom makes huge portions and buys a lot of unhealthy food like chocolate. The author has tried talking to their mom about this, but the mom's response is always \"Well, you don't have to eat it,\" which isn't helpful. The author feels that the mom is partly responsible for their weight and has tried to get her help in losing weight, but the mom is dismissive.\n\nSo, first, the user is asking if the author is at fault (A) or not (B). Let me break this down. The author is trying to take steps to lose weight, which is a positive action. They live with their mom, who is also obese. The mom's cooking habits are contributing to the problem. The author is trying to communicate their needs but is facing resistance. The key points here are the author's efforts to address the issue and the mom's lack of support. \n\nIs the author wrong for wanting to eat less and asking for help? Probably not. They are trying to take control of their health. The mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" is common but not helpful in this context. It's a parent's role to support their child, especially if they can recognize their own contribution to the problem. The mother's dismissive attitude might indicate she's not in denial but maybe in denial about her own role or her own health.\n\nSo the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their needs and trying to make changes. They are seeking support, which is reasonable. The mother is the one not providing the necessary support. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
