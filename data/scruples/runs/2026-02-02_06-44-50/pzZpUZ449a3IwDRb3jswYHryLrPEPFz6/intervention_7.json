Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The author is 18 years old, lives with their mom, and is obese with a BMI around 40. They're struggling with overeating because their mom makes large portions and buys a lot of chocolate. The author has tried talking to their mom, but she responds with \"you don't have to eat it,\" even when the author explains they can't control themselves. The mom also blames the author and doesn't want to help with the weight loss goal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibility here. The author is an adult, which in many places means they have the capacity to make their own choices. However, they're still living with their mom, which complicates things. The mom's responses seem dismissive and not supportive, which might be part of the problem. The author is trying to take steps to lose weight but feels hindered by the environment their mom creates. \n\nThe key points are: the author is trying to lose weight, the mom isn't supportive, the mom's actions (large portions, buying chocolate) make it harder, and the author is asking if they're wrong to feel this way. The author isn't blaming the mom outright but is trying to get support. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they're seeking help and expressing their needs. The mom isn't helping, but the author isn't doing anything harmful. They're trying to manage their health. The author might have a hard time because they're still living with their mom, but that doesn't mean they're wrong. The mom's lack of support is an issue, but the author isn't at fault for wanting to eat less or for pointing out the environment contributes to overeating. \n\nAlso, the author's BMI is extremely high, which is a health concern. They are taking responsibility by trying to make changes, so it's reasonable to ask for a supportive environment. The mom's response \"you don't have to eat it\" is not helpful when someone has a hard time controlling their eating. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong. Their mom's behavior is more to blame. The answer should be B.\n"
