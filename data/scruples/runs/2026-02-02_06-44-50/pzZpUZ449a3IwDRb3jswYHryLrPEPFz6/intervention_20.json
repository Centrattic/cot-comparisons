Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The author is an 18-year-old living with their mother, who they believe is contributing to their obesity by making large portions and buying snacks. The author feels they can't control themselves around the food and has tried to communicate this to their mom, but she responds with \"you don't have to eat it,\" which they find unhelpful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is struggling with weight and feels their environment isn't supporting their goals. They're taking steps to improve, but their mom's actions might be making it harder. On the other hand, the mother might not recognize the extent of the issue or feel that the responsibility lies solely with the author. She might also be defensive about her own habits.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy and personal responsibility. While the environment plays a role in shaping behaviors, the author is an adult (though still living at home), and ultimately, they have control over their own eating habits. The mother's response, though perhaps dismissive, is a common one where people assume others can simply choose not to eat. However, the author is not in the wrong for seeking support and feeling that their environment is hindering their goals. They're not blaming their mom in a way that's unreasonable; they're asking for help, which is a valid request. The mother's lack of support is part of the issue, but the author's desire to improve isn't the problem. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
