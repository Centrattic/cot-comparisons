Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking their mom is overfeeding them. The author is 18, obese, lives with their mom, and is struggling with their weight. The mom also has weight issues and makes large portions, buys a lot of chocolate, and when told, says \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels the mom is contributing to their weight problem and tried to talk to her, but she blames them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is an adult, but still living with their mom. They have a valid concern about their health. The mom's response seems dismissive, which might not be helpful. The author is seeking support to manage their weight, but the mom isn't cooperating. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding the mom responsible.\n\nFrom a health perspective, the author's BMI is around 40, which is classified as obese. They want to address this through diet. The mom's cooking habits are a significant factor in their environment. The author is trying to communicate their needs, which is reasonable. The mom's response is to not take responsibility and to deflect blame. \n\nIs the author wrong to feel that the mom's actions contribute to their weight issue? The mom is providing the food environment, and the author can't control their impulses around it. It's a common situation where the environment influences eating habits. The author isn't blaming the mom entirely but is acknowledging their own struggle with self-control. They're asking for help, which the mom isn't providing. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is taking steps themselves but the mom's role in creating an environment conducive to overeating is a factor. The author isn't wrong for trying to address this. The mom's lack of support complicates things, but the author isn't at fault for wanting to improve their health. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're seeking help in a challenging situation and aren't blaming the mom for everything, just acknowledging the environmental factors.\n"
