Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is 18, lives with their mom, and is obese with a BMI around 40. They mention that they want to lose weight and have approached their mom about her cooking large portions and buying a lot of chocolate. The mom's response is always \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels the mom is contributing to their obesity and tried to get support but the mom blames them and doesn't take it seriously. The author is considering moving out to tackle the issue.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know the community's take. Let me break it down.\n\nThe author is trying to address a health issue. They're taking responsibility by wanting to change their eating habits but are struggling with their environment. The mom's behavior\u2014making large portions and buying unhealthy snacks\u2014could be making it harder for the author to lose weight. The author is asking for support from their mom, which is reasonable because eating together can influence habits.\n\nThe mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" seems dismissive. It's true that the author has a choice, but if they have a compulsion or lack willpower, the environment plays a role. The author isn't blaming the mom directly but is pointing out that the mom's actions might be contributing. It's a common issue where someone in an unhealthy environment finds it hard to make better choices.\n\nIs the author wrong for feeling upset about their mom's role? Well, they are trying to improve their health and are seeking support. They aren't making their mom take full responsibility but are asking for some cooperation. The mom's age isn't a valid excuse for not supporting her child's health goals. The author's plan to move out is a personal choice, but the situation is about their current environment.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, being in the wrong usually involves being unreasonable, disrespectful, or causing harm without cause. The author is expressing a legitimate health concern and seeking help. The mom's lack of support isn't the author's fault. The author isn't shaming the mom for her own weight but is focused on their own health. So the author isn't in the wrong here. They\u2019re struggling with a health issue and are trying to get support, which is understandable. The mom's dismissive attitude is the issue, not the author's request for assistance.\n"
