Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a 18-year-old who's obese and living with their mom. The mom cooks big portions and buys a lot of chocolate, and when the kid tells her to stop, the mom says \"you don't have to eat it.\" The kid feels like the mom is contributing to their weight problem and tried to talk to her about it, but the mom blames them and says losing weight is up to them. The kid wants to move out and lose weight then.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let me break this down. The kid is trying to manage their health, which is their right. They're asking for support from their mom, which is reasonable. The mom isn't providing that support and is dismissive. The kid is not blaming the mom as the sole cause but is acknowledging their own responsibility but also needing help. The mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" might be simplistic because the kid has a hard time resisting. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the kid is seeking help for a health issue. It's not their fault for wanting to address their weight. The mom's behavior might contribute, but it's not entirely her fault either. The kid is trying to communicate their needs, which is a responsible action. So, the kid isn't in the wrong. They're trying to take control of their health while still living with their mom. The mom isn't helping, but the kid's actions are understandable. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
