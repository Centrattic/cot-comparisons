Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who is 18 and living with their mom, is obese and trying to lose weight. The mom often makes big portions and buys a lot of chocolate, then tells the author they don't have to eat it. The author feels their mom is contributing to their weight and tried to talk to her, but she blamed the author and didn't help. The author is now wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is an adult now, living with their mom. They have a BMI around 40, which is morbidly obese. They mention they can still walk and run, but obviously want to lose weight. The mom also has weight issues. The author is trying to take steps to eat better but feels their mom's habits are making it hard. They tried to talk to her, and the mom's response was dismissive.\n\nThe key points are: the author is trying to take responsibility for their health but feels their mom's behavior is hindering them. The mom's response is to blame the author for not having self-control. The author is in a situation where they share a home and possibly meals with their mom, so the environment is a factor.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's intention is to improve their health, which is understandable. The mom's actions (large portions, buying chocolate) are part of the environment the author is in. However, the author is an adult and has some autonomy. Even though the mom prepares the food, the author has the choice to take smaller portions or not eat the chocolate. But the author admits they struggle with self-control, which complicates things.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for feeling that their mom's habits contribute to their weight? Probably not. It's reasonable to feel that an environment with constant access to high-calorie food makes weight loss harder. The author is trying to communicate their needs, which is a positive step. The mom's response isn't helpful, which is a problem on her end.\n\nHowever, the author is still living at home, so there might be limitations on how much they can change the household environment. The fact that the author is taking steps themselves suggests they're trying to take responsibility. They plan to move out in four years, which might give them more control.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The author isn't the one making the large portions or buying the chocolate; that's the mom. The author is expressing a need for support, which the mom isn't providing. The author isn't at fault for wanting a healthier environment. The mom's blame on the author for not controlling themselves is a problem, but the author's initial stance isn't wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). They're seeking help in a difficult situation and are trying to take steps to improve their health. The mom's behavior is part of the issue, but the author isn't to blame for it.\n"
