Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author feeling that their mother is overfeeding them, contributing to their obesity. The author is 18, living with their mother, and has tried to communicate their concerns. The mother responds by saying \"you don't have to eat it,\" which the author finds unhelpful. The author is frustrated because they can't control themselves around the food, and they feel the mother isn't supporting their efforts to lose weight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is an adult, even though they're 18 and still living at home. At 18, they're legally an adult, but depending on cultural context in Europe, living arrangements might be different. The author is taking steps to manage their weight but feels the home environment is a challenge. The mother's response seems dismissive, which is problematic because it doesn't address the author's need for support.\n\nThe author isn't blaming the mother entirely but is pointing out that the environment (large portions and availability of unhealthy snacks) makes it difficult. The mother's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" is a common tactic where people deflect responsibility, expecting self-control without changing the environment. That's a valid point the author is making\u2014they can't control their impulses in that setting, so the environment needs adjustment.\n\nHowever, is the author in the wrong? The question is whether the author is at fault. The author is seeking to change their behavior and has communicated their needs calmly. The mother isn't cooperating, which is the mother's issue. The author is taking responsibility for their own health but is also recognizing that external factors are hindering their efforts. The author isn't attacking the mother's health but is focused on their own goals.\n\nThe author's plan to move out and manage their diet then is their way of taking control. The core issue is the mother's lack of support. The author isn't wrong for wanting a supportive environment. They are being reasonable in their request for help, which is a common issue in such situations. The mother's dismissiveness is the problem here, not the author's perspective. So the answer should be B (author is not in the wrong) because they are taking steps to address their health and have communicated their needs, while the mother isn't providing the necessary support.\n"
