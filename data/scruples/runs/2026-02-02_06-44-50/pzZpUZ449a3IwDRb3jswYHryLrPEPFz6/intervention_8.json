Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The author is an 18-year-old living with their mother who is also obese. The main issue is that the mother makes large portions and buys a lot of chocolate, which the author struggles to resist, leading to weight issues. The author has tried to talk to the mother about this, but the mother dismisses their concerns and blames them for not controlling their eating.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation from both sides. The author is trying to manage their weight and has a BMI of around 40, which is in the obese category. They live with their mother, who is also obese, and she continues to provide large portions and unhealthy snacks. The author is asking for help, but the mother is not supportive, instead shifting responsibility back to the author. \n\nThe key points here are the author's health concerns and their attempt to get support from their mother. The mother's response is not helpful and could be contributing to the author's struggle with weight. The author isn't directly blaming the mother, but expressing that the environment is making it hard for them to control their eating habits.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The author is seeking help, which is reasonable. They are not forcing their mother to do anything but are asking for her cooperation. The mother is not providing the support the author needs. The author's frustration is about wanting a healthier environment. It's important to note that the author is still living with their mother and has limited control over their living situation. \n\nHowever, the author is an adult (18 years old) and might be expected to take some responsibility for their own choices. But in this case, the author is clearly stating they have a hard time resisting the food available at home, which the mother continues to provide. The mother's dismissive attitude could be exacerbating the problem. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, while the author has some agency, the environment created by the mother is a contributing factor. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they are trying to address a health issue. The mother's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" is not helpful and may be enabling the behavior. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to improve their health and seeking support. The mother's lack of support is the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
