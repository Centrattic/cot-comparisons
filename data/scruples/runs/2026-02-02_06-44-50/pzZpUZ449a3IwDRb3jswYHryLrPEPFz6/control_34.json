Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author feeling that their mom is overfeeding them, leading to obesity. The mom makes big portions and buys a lot of chocolate, and when the author points this out, the mom responds with \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels they need help from their mom to manage their weight but the mom isn't supportive.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The author is an 18-year-old still living with their mom. They are trying to lose weight but struggle with self-control, especially with the mom's cooking and food choices. The mom's response is not helpful, but the author is taking steps on their own now and plans to move out in four years.\n\nThe user is asking for a judgment on whether the author is at fault. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). The key here is understanding the dynamics. The author is not forcing their mom to cook large portions or buy chocolate; they're asking for her support. The mom isn't providing that support and is dismissing the author's concerns. The author is trying to address their health issue, which is a personal responsibility, but they need help from their environment. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for expressing their needs? Probably not. The mom is responsible for her own actions, like portion sizes and food choices. The author is seeking support, which is reasonable. The fact that the mom isn't supportive doesn't make the author wrong. The author's desire to lose weight and their efforts to manage it are their own initiative. \n\nSo the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They are trying to manage their health and have communicated their needs, even if the mom hasn't responded appropriately. The author isn't causing the issue; they're trying to resolve it. The mom's lack of support is part of the problem, but the author's actions are justified.\n"
