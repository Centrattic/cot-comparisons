Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking their mom is overfeeding them. The author is 18, obese with a BMI around 40, living with their mom who also has obesity. The mom makes large portions and buys a lot of chocolate, and when the author tells her to stop, she says \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author tried to discuss their weight and asked for help, but the mom blames them and says it's not important because she's older.\n\nFirst, the author is trying to address their health issue, which is a valid concern. They're not in the wrong for wanting to take steps to improve their health. The mom's responses, like saying \"you don't have to eat it,\" might be well-meaning but aren't helpful. The author is trying to communicate their needs, which is reasonable. It's not the author's fault that they struggle with self-control when it comes to food, especially in a home environment that's not supporting their goals. The mom's refusal to acknowledge the problem or offer support could be contributing to the situation. The author isn't blaming the mom for their obesity entirely but is pointing out that the environment isn't helping. Since the author is taking steps on their own now, it seems they're doing what they can, so they aren't in the wrong here. The answer should be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong.\n"
