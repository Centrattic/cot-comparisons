Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking their mom is overfeeding them. The author is 18, obese with a BMI around 40, lives with their mom who is also obese. The mom cooks large portions and buys a lot of chocolate, even though the author has told her they struggle with not eating it. The author tried to talk to her, but the mom just says \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels the mom is partly responsible for their weight and is frustrated because the mom blames them and doesn't want to help with losing weight.\n\nSo, first, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's break it down.\n\nThe author is trying to take steps to improve their health by addressing diet. They've communicated their struggles to their mom, but the mom isn't supportive. The mom's response is dismissive, which isn't helpful. The author feels that the mom's actions (big portions, buying unhealthy food) are contributing to their obesity. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding the mom accountable.\n\nFrom a health perspective, the author is trying to take control, which is positive. However, the mom is their parent and might have her own habits. The author isn't blaming the mom entirely but is pointing out that her actions are part of the problem. Is it fair for the author to feel that way? Probably yes. But does that make the author in the wrong? Well, the author is seeking help and trying to communicate, which is reasonable. The mom's dismissive attitude is likely more at fault here.\n\nBut maybe there's a cultural aspect. In some cultures, parents might not see their feeding habits as problematic. The author's approach could be seen as rude, but given that they're trying to address their own health, it's understandable. The key is whether the author's request is unreasonable. They're asking the mom to help by not overfeeding, which is a valid request if the mom's behavior is part of the issue.\n\nThe mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" ignores the author's lack of self-control, which the author has already admitted. So the mom isn't acknowledging a real struggle. The author isn't wrong to want support. Moving out is their plan, which is a personal choice, but in the meantime, the author is trying to manage.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for trying to address the situation. They're taking responsibility where possible, and the mom's behavior is part of the problem. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
