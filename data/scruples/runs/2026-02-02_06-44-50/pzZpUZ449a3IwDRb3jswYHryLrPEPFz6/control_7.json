Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, who is obese, is living with their mother who also has a large appetite. The author is struggling to control their eating, especially when the mother makes large portions and buys a lot of chocolate. The author tried to talk to their mother about it, but the mother keeps telling them they don't have to eat it, and when the author suggests they both lose weight, the mother says it doesn't matter for her age. The author feels unsupported and is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nSo, to determine if the author is in the wrong (answer A) or not (answer B), I need to analyze the situation. The key points are that the author is an adult (18 years old), living with their mother, and trying to manage their weight. They've communicated their struggles to their mother, but the mother isn't helping and is making it harder with the portions and snacks. The author is seeking support but isn't getting it, and now they're blaming the mother for contributing to their weight issues.\n\nFirst, the author isn't wrong for wanting to lose weight and trying to take steps to do so. They have a right to their health goals. The mother's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" might be dismissive. While the mother isn't forcing the author to eat, her actions (making large portions and buying chocolate) are creating an environment that's difficult for the author to manage their eating. The author is trying to take responsibility by communicating their needs, which is the right approach. The mother's refusal to support or adjust might be contributing to the problem. \n\nHowever, the author is still living at home and hasn't moved out, so they might have some agency in their own choices. But the core issue is that they're asking for support and aren't getting it. The author isn't in the wrong for holding their mother accountable for her role in the environment that makes it hard to control their eating. The mother's behavior is enabling the problem, so the author isn't at fault for pointing that out. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
