Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author thinking their mom is overfeeding them, leading to obesity. The author is 18, lives with their mom, and has tried to talk to her about portion sizes and her buying chocolate. The mom's response is always \"you don't have to eat it,\" but the author struggles with self-control.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about responsibility. The author is obese and trying to lose weight, but the environment at home is contributing. The mom is making large portions and buying unhealthy snacks, which the author can't resist despite knowing they shouldn't eat them. The author has communicated their issues to the mom, but the mom isn't helping and instead blames the author for not controlling themselves.\n\nFrom a typical AITA perspective, the question is whether the author's actions or expectations are unreasonable. The author is seeking support from their mom to create a healthier environment, which is a reasonable request. The mom's response of not helping and blaming the author is not supportive. The author isn't forcing themselves to eat the food; they're just reacting to the environment. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting help. The mom's behavior is the issue here. The author is trying to take steps to improve their health, which is positive. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
