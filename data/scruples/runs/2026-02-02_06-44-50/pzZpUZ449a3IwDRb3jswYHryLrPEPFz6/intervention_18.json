Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author, who is obese with a BMI around 40, living with their mom who is also obese. The author feels that their mom's overfeeding is contributing to their weight, especially since they have a hard time resisting the large portions and sweets. They tried talking to their mom, but she responds with \"well you don't have to eat it,\" and the author feels unsupported. The author is wondering if they're at fault for blaming their mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is 18 and still living at home. They mentioned that they have told their mom about their struggles with overeating and the portions, but the mom doesn't seem to adjust. The mom's response is dismissive, which the author finds unhelpful. The author is trying to take steps to lose weight but feels the environment isn't supportive.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to evaluate both sides. The author is clearly struggling with their health and is trying to address the issue. They're not blaming their mom for their entire weight problem but are pointing out that the environment (large portions and availability of unhealthy food) is making it harder. The mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" might be a common one, but it's not helpful if the person is struggling with self-control in that situation.\n\nFrom a health perspective, having a supportive environment is important. If a parent knows their child has issues with overeating, they might need to adjust their cooking habits. However, the author is an adult, so maybe they are responsible for their own choices. On the other hand, the mom's behavior could be enabling the problem without realizing it.\n\nBut the author is asking if they're wrong for thinking their mom is overfeeding them. The key points are that the author has communicated their needs, the mom isn't responding, and the author is trying to manage their own health. The author isn't necessarily at fault for wanting support. It's a complex situation where both parties have roles. The mom could be more supportive, but the author is not wrong for seeking that support. They are taking steps to improve their health despite the challenges.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because the author is trying to address a real issue and has communicated their needs, even if the mom isn't cooperating. The author isn't responsible for their mom's actions, and it's reasonable for them to feel that support would help their health goals.\n"
