Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, who is 18 and obese, living with their mother. The mother is also obese and makes large portions and buys a lot of chocolate. The author has tried to tell their mom that her cooking habits are contributing to their weight problem, but the mom responds with \"Well, you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels unsupported and is considering moving out to manage their weight better.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author is trying to address their weight issue and is asking for help from their mother. The mother's response is not supportive, which makes the author feel like they're being blamed. The author is trying to be responsible by addressing the issue, but the mother isn't helping.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author is trying to communicate a problem they have with the food portions and availability of unhealthy snacks. They're being honest about their struggle with self-control. The mother's response is dismissive, which is not helpful. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is taking a step to address their health, which is positive. However, the author might be placing blame on the mother for their own weight. While the mother's habits might contribute, the author has the agency to make their own food choices. That said, the mother's environment and portions can influence eating behaviors, especially for someone with self-control issues. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong for asking their mother to adjust her cooking? Probably not. It's reasonable for someone to ask for support from family, especially when they're living together. The mother's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" is a common but not helpful response to someone who struggles with overeating. The author isn't wrong for seeking that support. \n\nOn the flip side, the author might be overstepping by blaming the mother for their weight. However, given the mother's habits, there's a valid point in asking for a more supportive environment. The author is also taking steps on their own, planning to move out and manage their weight independently. \n\nThe mother's age argument about not needing to lose weight might be a way to avoid addressing her own habits. The author's frustration is understandable. So, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for trying to communicate their needs and seeking support. The mother's response is the issue here, not the author's initial request.\n"
