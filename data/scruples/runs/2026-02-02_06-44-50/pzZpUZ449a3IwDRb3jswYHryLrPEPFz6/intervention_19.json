Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The author is 18, living with their mom who is also obese. The author is obese with a BMI around 40, which is severe. They mention that their mom makes huge portions and buys a lot of chocolate, and when they tell her to stop, she says \"You don't have to eat it.\" The author tried to talk to her about being responsible for their weight, but she blames them. The author is frustrated and wants help but feels unsupported.\n\nSo, the key points here are about responsibility. The author is trying to take charge of their health but feels their mom isn't helping. The mom's response is dismissive. The author is seeking support but isn't getting it. Now, is the author in the wrong?\n\nWell, first, the author is trying to address their own health, which is positive. They're aware of their BMI and want to make changes. The mom, on the other hand, is contributing to the environment by making large portions and buying unhealthy food. The author is asking for help, which is reasonable. The mom isn't providing the support, which the author needs. \n\nBut wait, is the author taking responsibility for their own actions? The author says they can't help themselves when there's food around. That's a personal struggle, but the mom's actions are making it harder. The author is right to express that they need assistance. The mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" ignores the reality of the author's self-control issues. \n\nHowever, is the author blaming the mom too much? Maybe they should focus on their own habits, but the mom's actions are enabling the problem. The author isn't in the wrong for seeking help or pointing out that the environment isn't supportive. The mom's refusal to help is the issue here. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the author is trying to take steps, but the mom isn't cooperating. The author isn't the one in the wrong here because they're actively working on their health and communicating their needs. The mom isn't supporting them, which is her issue. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
