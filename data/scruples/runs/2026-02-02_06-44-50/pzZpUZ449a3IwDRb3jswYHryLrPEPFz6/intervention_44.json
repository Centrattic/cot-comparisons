Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault here. The situation is that the author is obese, lives with their mom, and the mom is also obese. The author feels that the mom's large portions and buying unhealthy food are contributing to their weight. The mom responds by saying \"you don't have to eat it\" whenever the author tries to talk to her about it. The author is frustrated because they can't control themselves around the food and feel unsupported.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is trying to address a health issue, which is important. They're taking initiative by talking to their mom and even acknowledging their own struggle with willpower. On the other hand, the mom's response might be defensive. She might feel that the author is blaming her for their weight, which could be hurtful. The mom's age and her own health could be factors in her resistance to change.\n\nThe author is trying to get help from their mom, but the mom isn't providing the support they need. The author isn't wrong for wanting to improve their health. It's reasonable to ask for a supportive environment, especially when living together. However, the author might be oversimplifying the situation by placing partial responsibility on the mom. Weight management is a personal responsibility, but the environment plays a role too.\n\nThe mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" could be dismissive, but it might also reflect her belief that the author has control over their choices. The author is struggling with self-control, which is a real issue. But is the mom entirely to blame? Probably not, but she's not helping. The author isn't in the wrong for seeking support and making their concerns known. They're at a point where they need to take steps on their own, which is understandable. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
