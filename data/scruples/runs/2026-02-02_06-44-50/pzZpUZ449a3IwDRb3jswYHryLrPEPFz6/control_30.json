Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking their mom is overfeeding them. The author is 18, obese, lives with their mom, and has tried to talk to her about portion sizes and the chocolate. The mom responds with \"you don't have to eat it,\" but the author can't help themselves. They feel the mom is partly responsible and tried to get her to help with weight loss, but she blames them and says it doesn't matter for her.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault here. The author is trying to address their obesity by managing their diet. They're living with their mom, who is also obese, and she makes large portions and buys a lot of chocolate. The author is honest about their struggle with self-control and has communicated this to their mom multiple times. \n\nThe mom's response is dismissive, telling them not to eat what's there. But the author's point is that the environment is contributing to their weight issue. It's a common dynamic where a parent's habits influence a child's, especially when they live together. The author isn't blaming the mom entirely but is saying that the environment isn't helping. They want support, not blame. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is wrong to feel that way. Since the author is trying to take steps to improve their health and is communicating their needs, they're not in the wrong for expressing that. The mom's response is unhelpful, but the author isn't at fault for wanting help. They're in a tough situation, trying to manage their health while living in an environment that's not supportive. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're taking initiative to address their health, communicating their issues, and are in a situation where they need support. The mom's behavior is part of the problem, but the author is not wrong for seeking change.\n"
