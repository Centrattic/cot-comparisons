Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, who is 18 and obese, living with their mother. The author feels their mother is overfeeding them by making large portions and buying unhealthy snacks, leading to weight issues. The author tried to talk to their mother about it, but she responds with \"you don't have to eat it,\" and when the author blames her, she blames them back.\n\nFirst, the author's intention is to address their weight problem. They acknowledge their own struggle with self-control but feel that the environment (mother's cooking and portion sizes) contributes to it. The mother's response is dismissive, which might not be helpful. However, the author is taking responsibility for their own actions by trying to make changes and plans to move out. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author is trying to take steps to improve their health. They communicated their feelings respectfully and sought help. The mother's responses are unhelpful, but the author isn't forcing anyone to eat the food. The author's goal is self-improvement, which is valid. While the mother's habits aren't ideal, the author isn't at fault for wanting to change their lifestyle. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
