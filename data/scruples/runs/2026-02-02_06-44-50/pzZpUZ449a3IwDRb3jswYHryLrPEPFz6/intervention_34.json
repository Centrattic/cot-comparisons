Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation. The author is 18, living with their mom, obese, and feels that their mom's large portions and buying unhealthy snacks contribute to their weight. They've tried talking to their mom, who responds with \"you don't have to eat it,\" and the author feels unsupported.\n\nFirst, the author's goal is to lose weight and has acknowledged their own struggles with self-control. They're asking if they're at fault. The mom's responses seem dismissive, but the author is trying to take responsibility by making changes even though it's hard. The key here is whether the author is in the wrong for feeling that way and expressing it.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to express their concerns about their health. They're trying to take steps to improve, which shows initiative. On the other hand, they're living with their mother, and the mother might not be directly causing the author's weight gain. The author's responsibility to manage their own health is important. However, the mother's environment (portions and snacks) could make it harder. \n\nThe author isn't blaming the mom entirely but is seeking support, which the mom isn't providing. The author's actions (expressing concerns) are reasonable. The mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" might be true, but practical support is needed. The author isn't in the wrong for seeking that support. So, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
