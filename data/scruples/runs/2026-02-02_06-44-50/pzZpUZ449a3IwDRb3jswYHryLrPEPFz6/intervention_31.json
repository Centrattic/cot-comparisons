Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again. The user is 18, lives with their mom, and is obese with a BMI of around 40. They want to lose weight and have told their mom that she's contributing by making large portions and buying a lot of sweets. The mom responds with \"you don't have to eat it,\" and the author feels like the mom isn't helping. The author is asking if they're the a**hole for thinking the mom is overfeeding them.\n\nFirst, the author is trying to take responsibility for their own health, which is commendable. They mentioned they can't control themselves when there's a lot of food around, so they're seeking support from their mom. The mom's response is dismissive, not addressing the issue and instead deflecting blame. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the author is taking steps to address their weight, which is positive. They're communicating their needs to their mom but aren't getting the support they need. The mom's actions (big portions, buying sweets) might not be malicious, but they do create an environment that's hard for the author to manage. The author is frustrated and feels unsupported, which is understandable. \n\nHowever, does the author have the right to blame the mom? Maybe the mom isn't intentionally causing the problem, but the author is in a situation where they need to make changes. The author is being honest about their struggle and is trying to find a solution. The mom isn't taking their concerns seriously, which is part of the issue. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're seeking help and acknowledging their own challenges. The mom's response is the problem here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
