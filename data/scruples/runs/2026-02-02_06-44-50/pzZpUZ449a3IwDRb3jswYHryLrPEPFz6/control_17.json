Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's mom making large portions and buying a lot of chocolate, which the author struggles to resist. The author is obese and has tried to address this with their mom, but she responds with \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels their mom is contributing to their weight problem and is frustrated that she doesn't help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's position. They are 18, living with their mom, and dealing with obesity. They've communicated their issues with their mom, but she isn't supportive. The key points are the mom's behavior and the author's attempts to get help. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for wanting to manage their health. They've tried to approach their mom calmly and have explained their struggles. The mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" is dismissive and doesn't address the underlying issue that the author has difficulty controlling their eating when food is present. \n\nThe author's mom is likely contributing to the problem by not adjusting the portions or reducing unhealthy foods, especially since she's aware of the author's issues. The fact that the author is taking steps on their own and plans to move out to manage it better shows they're trying. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is on whether the person did something wrong. Here, the author is seeking support and accountability, not causing harm. The mom's lack of support is the main issue. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
