Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author thinking their mom is overfeeding them, contributing to their obesity. The mom keeps giving large portions and snack foods, and when the author tries to talk about it, the mom blames them for eating it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is 18, lives with their mom, and has a high BMI. They mention struggling with self-control around food and have communicated their concerns to their mom. The mom's response is to tell them they don't have to eat it, which the author finds unhelpful. The author feels their mom is partly responsible for their weight and wants her to help them both lose weight, but the mom dismisses it because of her age.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author is trying to address a health issue and has communicated their needs. They're not forcing their mom to do anything; they're asking for support. The mom, on the other hand, isn't providing the support the author needs. The author isn't blaming the mom directly but pointing out that the environment (large portions, availability of unhealthy snacks) makes it hard for them to manage their weight. \n\nThe author's actions seem reasonable. They're not demanding their mom to change her habits but are asking for help. The mom's response is dismissive, which might be affecting the author's efforts. Since the author is taking steps themselves but seeks support, it's about shared responsibility. The mom's age isn't a valid excuse if she's contributing to the unhealthy environment. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're seeking help and have a legitimate health concern. The mom's lack of support is the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
