Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is 18, lives with their mom, is obese with a BMI around 40. They mention that their mom is also obese. They say that the mom makes huge portions and buys a lot of chocolate. The author tries to tell their mom not to make so much food or buy the chocolate because they can't help themselves, and the mom responds with \"Well, you don't have to eat it.\" The author then took it a step further and told the mom that she's partly responsible for their weight. The mom blamed the author instead. The author is now wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The author is trying to address their own health by reducing food intake, but the mom's actions are making it harder. The author is taking responsibility by acknowledging their inability to control their eating, which is a common issue with obesity. They've asked the mom for help, but the mom isn't supportive. The key here is whether the author is in the wrong for holding their mom accountable for creating an environment that's not supportive of their weight loss goals.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to improve their health and is being honest about their struggle. On the other hand, the mom is providing food, which is a basic need, but in portions and types that aren't helping. The mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" is dismissive and doesn't address the author's issue of lack of self-control in that situation. The author isn't to blame for wanting to address their health and asking for support. The mom's behavior is contributing to the problem, so the author isn't wrong for pointing that out. They're in a vulnerable position and seeking help, which is reasonable.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong here. They're trying to take steps to improve their health despite the challenges at home. The mom's response is not helpful, and the author is justified in feeling frustrated.\n"
