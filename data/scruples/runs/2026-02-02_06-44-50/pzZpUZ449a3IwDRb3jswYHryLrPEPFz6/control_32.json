Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's mother making large portions and buying a lot of chocolate, which the author says they can't help eating. The author feels their mom is contributing to their obesity and has tried to talk to her, but she blames them for not having self-control.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is 18 and living with their mother. Both have obesity issues. The author is trying to eat healthier but struggles with the portions and availability of unhealthy food. The mom's response is to tell them not to eat it, which the author finds unhelpful since they can't control themselves.\n\nFrom a responsibility standpoint, the author is trying to take steps to improve their health, which is commendable. However, the mom's actions (overportioning food and buying lots of chocolate) might be enabling the author's habit. The key issue is whether the author is wrong for feeling that their mom is part of the problem and for expressing that.\n\nThe author isn't blaming the mom outright but is seeking help. The mom isn't cooperating, which could mean the author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the issue. It's about shared responsibility in a household where both have similar health issues. The author isn't in a position to control the mom's actions, so it's reasonable for them to express their needs, even if the mom is resistant.\n\nAlso, considering the author's age, 18, they might still be in a dependent situation, and their health is a valid concern. The mom's response of not helping and dismissing the author's struggles could be seen as not supporting their efforts. The author isn't wrong for wanting to address the environment that's making it hard to maintain healthy habits.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're advocating for their health and acknowledging their own challenges, which is a responsible approach. The mother is not cooperating, but that doesn't make the author at fault for trying to communicate their needs.\n"
