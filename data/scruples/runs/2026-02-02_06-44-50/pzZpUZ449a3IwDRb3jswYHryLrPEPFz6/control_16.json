Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking their mom is overfeeding them. The situation is that the author is obese and lives with their mother, who also has obesity. The author has tried to talk to their mom about the large portions and the availability of unhealthy food, but the mom responds with \"You don't have to eat it.\" The author feels their mom is partly responsible for their weight and is struggling to control their eating habits.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is wrong for having this perspective. The author's intention is to address their health, which is a valid concern. They're trying to take steps to improve their BMI, which is significantly high. The mother's behavior\u2014making large portions and buying lots of chocolate\u2014could contribute to the author's difficulty in controlling their eating. However, does that make the mother entirely at fault? The author is an adult (18 years old) and has autonomy over their choices. The mother's response, while perhaps dismissive, is also within her rights as a parent. She's providing food, and the author's choice to eat it is their own decision.\n\nBut wait, the author mentions that they can't control themselves when the food is available. That's a key point. The author is struggling with self-control, which might be influenced by factors like emotional eating, addiction, or other psychological issues. The mother's insistence on preparing large portions and buying tempting snacks might be exacerbating the problem, even if unintentionally. However, the mother isn't forcing the author to eat it. The author could choose to eat less or not eat the chocolate, but they find it hard to resist.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for holding their mom responsible. Since the mother is also obese, there might be shared family habits or environmental factors contributing. But the author's approach of directly confronting the mother might have been a reasonable step. The mother's response of shifting responsibility could be seen as dismissive, but the author isn't wrong for seeking support. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to address their health and seeking help from their parent. They're not making the mother the sole cause but acknowledging that the environment plays a role.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author is taking responsibility for their own health but is also recognizing the environmental factors that make it harder for them. They're trying to communicate and seek support, which is a reasonable approach. The mother's response is problematic, but the author isn't wrong for wanting to address it. They're not blaming the mother entirely but asking for help. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
