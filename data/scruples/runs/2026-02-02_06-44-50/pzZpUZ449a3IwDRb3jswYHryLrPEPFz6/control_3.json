Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the person is obese and lives with their mother, who makes large portions and buys a lot of chocolate. The author feels that the mother's habits are contributing to their obesity and has tried to talk to her about it, but the mother responds with \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels unsupported and wants help from their mother, but she's not providing it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is 18 and still living with their mother. They have a BMI of around 40, which is morbidly obese. They mention that they can still walk and run, but it's clear they want to lose weight. Their mother is also obese, and she makes big portions and buys a lot of chocolate. When the author tries to address this, the mother's response is dismissive. The author feels that the mother is partly responsible for their weight and is asking if they're at fault for thinking that.\n\nNow, the key points here are about responsibility. The author is trying to take steps to lose weight, but they feel their environment is making it harder. The mother isn't helping, even though she's in a similar situation. The author is asking if they're wrong for holding the mother accountable for contributing to their obesity.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, it's important to consider that while the mother's habits may contribute, the author is an adult (18) and capable of making their own choices. However, the mother is providing the environment where these choices are made. The mother's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" is a common refrain, implying personal responsibility, but the author is struggling with self-control, which they've mentioned before.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for feeling that their mother's actions are part of the problem? Well, they are seeking help and expressing their needs, which is reasonable. The mother's refusal to support them, despite the author's clear struggles, might make the author feel unsupported. However, the mother might not realize the extent of the problem or how her actions are affecting her son.\n\nBut from the other side, does the author have the right to criticize their mother's behavior? The mother is also obese, and maybe she has her own struggles. However, the author's health is a concern, and they are seeking a supportive environment. The mother's response doesn't foster that support. The author isn't blaming the mother entirely but is acknowledging their own issues with self-control while also pointing out environmental factors.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, while the author is an adult, they might still be in a dependent relationship with their mother, which complicates things. The author isn't asking the mother to restrict them, just to reduce the portions and unhealthy foods to make it easier for them to manage their diet. The mother's lack of support here could be seen as contributing to the problem.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their concerns and seeking help. They are trying to take responsibility for their weight but need support from their environment. The mother's lack of support is part of the issue, so the author isn't at fault for pointing that out. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
