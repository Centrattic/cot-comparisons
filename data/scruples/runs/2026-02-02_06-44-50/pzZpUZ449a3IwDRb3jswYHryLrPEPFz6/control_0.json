Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author living with their mother, who is also obese, and they're struggling with overeating due to large portions and availability of unhealthy food. The author has tried to communicate their issue to their mother but faces resistance, with the mother's responses being dismissive, like \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels that the mother is contributing to their obesity and is seeking support, but the mother isn't providing it. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, considering the author's age (18) and living situation, it's common for them to be at home with their parents. The author is trying to take steps to improve their health, which is commendable. They've communicated their needs to their mother, who isn't responsive. The mother's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" might not address the author's struggle with self-control. The author isn't blaming the mother solely but is pointing out that the environment contributes to their problem. The mother's age and her own health issues might be factors, but the author's desire to get help doesn't make them wrong.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is taking initiative to address their health, which is a positive action. The mother's lack of support could be due to various reasons, but the author isn't in the wrong for wanting assistance. They're not making excuses but are honestly discussing their challenges. The mother's dismissiveness is more about her response than the author's fault. So, the author is not in the wrong for seeking help and expressing their needs. The answer would be B (No).\n"
