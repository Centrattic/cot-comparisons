Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is 18, living with their mom, and they're both obese. The author is trying to lose weight but finds it hard because their mom makes huge portions and buys a lot of chocolate. The author has asked their mom to stop, but the mom responds with \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels the mom is partly responsible for their weight and tries to get support, but the mom doesn't help. The author is asking if they're the asshole for thinking the mom is overfeeding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is an adult but still living with their mom. They're trying to manage their weight, which is a personal health goal. The mom, also struggling with her weight, continues to buy and prepare large portions of food. The author is taking a proactive step by communicating their needs, which is reasonable. The mom's response seems dismissive, not acknowledging the difficulty the author faces with self-control.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, people often have different coping mechanisms. The author might have a hard time resisting food, and having the environment filled with temptations isn't helpful. It's common for family members to not fully grasp how their actions affect others, especially in cases of addiction or compulsive behaviors. The mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" might be a way of deflecting responsibility, which can be frustrating for the author.\n\nLegally, there's no issue here since it's a family matter. Ethically, the question is whether the author is wrong for expressing their feelings. The author isn't forcing their mom to do anything; they're asking for support. The mom isn't obligated to change her habits, but the author has the right to express their needs. The author's frustration is valid because the environment they live in is contributing to their struggle.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is an adult, so they have autonomy. They could take steps to manage their own environment, like preparing their own meals or finding ways to eat separately. However, the mom's actions do create a challenging situation. The author's request for help is reasonable, and the mom's refusal isn't making things easier for the author.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's weight is a personal health issue, but the environment plays a role. The mom's cooking habits might be a contributing factor, but ultimately, the author has control over their own choices. However, when someone has a known issue with self-control (like the author mentions), the immediate environment can significantly impact their ability to manage it. So expecting the author to handle it alone might be unrealistic.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting support. They are taking steps to improve their health and are honest about their struggles. The mom's lack of support is problematic, but the author isn't at fault for seeking that support. The key point is that the author is trying to address the issue through communication, which is a responsible approach.\n"
