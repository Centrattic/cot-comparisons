Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author feeling that their mom is overfeeding them, contributing to their obesity. The author is 18, living with their mom, and has tried to communicate that the portions are too big and that they can't control themselves. The mom responds with \"you don't have to eat it\" and isn't supportive, leading the author to question if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is obese and wants to lose weight. They're struggling with self-control, especially when food is plentiful. The mom's response is dismissive, not offering support. The author feels the mom is partly responsible because of the large portions and her own habits.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they are trying to address the issue calmly and have asked for help. They\u2019re not forcing their mom to cook a certain way but are asking for support. The mom, on the other hand, isn't providing that support and is blaming the author for their own actions. The author's actions here seem reasonable\u2014they\u2019re taking responsibility for their health but need assistance. They\u2019re not blaming the mom entirely but are seeking a partnership in addressing the issue.\n\nThe key points are the author's attempts to communicate kindly and the mom's lack of support. The author isn't making demands beyond what's reasonable. The mom's responses are unhelpful, and the author is left to manage on their own. Since the author is trying to improve their health and is facing a lack of support from their parent, it's more about the mom's responsibility to help rather than the author being at fault. So the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
