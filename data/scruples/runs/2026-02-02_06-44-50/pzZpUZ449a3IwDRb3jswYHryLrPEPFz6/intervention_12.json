Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is 18, obese with a BMI of around 40, lives with their mom, and is trying to lose weight. They mention that their mom prepares large portions and buys food they can't resist, but when they try to address this, the mom responds with \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels their mom is partly responsible for their weight and tried to get her to help, but she blames them and dismisses their concerns.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is an adult living with their parent, which can complicate matters. The mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" might seem dismissive, but is that her fault? The author acknowledges their own struggle with self-control, which is a personal responsibility. However, the mom's actions (huge portions, buying tempting food) could be enabling the behavior. \n\nOn one hand, the author is taking steps to address their weight, which is positive. But they're also placing some blame on their mom, which might not be entirely fair. The mom might not realize the impact of her actions, or she could be trying to offer food as a form of care, which is common in some cultures. The author's approach to discussing the issue might need to be more constructive or empathetic to get their mom to understand without making her defensive.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom's refusal to help and her age-related dismissal could be contributing to the problem. The author's main issue is lack of support, but does that mean they're in the wrong? The author is seeking help, not demanding it. However, the author might need to recognize that their mom's behavior isn't the sole cause of their weight issues. Ultimately, the author's responsibility to manage their own health is a key factor here. They can't fully blame their mom for their lack of self-control. So maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in communication and self-advocacy. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the author is trying to make changes and the mom's behavior is part of the challenge they're facing.\n"
