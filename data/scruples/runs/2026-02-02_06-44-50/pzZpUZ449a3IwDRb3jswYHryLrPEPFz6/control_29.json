Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking their mom is overfeeding them. The author is 18, obese with a BMI around 40, and lives with their mom who also cooks large portions and buys a lot of chocolates. The author has mentioned their struggle with overeating to their mom, who responds with \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels the mom isn't helping and even blames them, leading to frustration.\n\nFirst, the author is trying to address their health issue, which is a valid concern. They're taking steps to manage their weight, which is responsible behavior. The mom's response is dismissive and doesn't acknowledge the author's specific problem with willpower. The mom's actions\u2014making big portions and buying chocolates\u2014might be enabling the author's overeating since they can't control themselves. However, the mom might not realize the extent of her son's struggle.\n\nThe key points here are the author's age (18, an adult) and their living situation. The author is trying to take responsibility by working on their health, but the environment (mom's cooking and food choices) is making it harder. The mom's lack of support could be an issue, but the author is within their rights to seek help. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting support; they're trying to improve their health. The mom's behavior might contribute, but the author isn't at fault for pointing that out. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
