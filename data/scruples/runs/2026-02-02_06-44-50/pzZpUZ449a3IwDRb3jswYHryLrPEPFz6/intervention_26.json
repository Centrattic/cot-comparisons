Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again to understand the situation properly.\n\nThe author is 18 years old, lives with their mother, and is obese with a BMI around 40. They mention that their mother also makes large portions and buys a lot of chocolate, which the author feels tempted to eat. The author has tried talking to their mom about this, but she responds with \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels that the mother is partly responsible for their weight and is frustrated because the mother doesn't support their efforts to lose weight. The author is considering moving out to handle their diet better.\n\nNow, the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but they want to know the actual answer. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). Let me analyze this.\n\nFirst, the author is trying to address their own health by addressing their eating habits. They are taking responsibility for their own actions, even though they mention the mother's role. The mother, however, isn't taking the issue seriously and isn't providing the support the author needs. The key here is that the author is seeking help but isn't getting it. The mother's response \"you don't have to eat it\" might be well-meaning but doesn't address the author's struggle with self-control. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, while the author has the ultimate control over their own eating, the environment created by the mother (large portions, easy access to unhealthy snacks) can contribute to the problem. However, the author is not in the wrong for pointing out this influence. They are trying to communicate their needs, which is a reasonable thing to do. The mother's lack of support is problematic, but that doesn't make the author the asshole for advocating for their own health.\n\nThe author isn't blaming the mother entirely; they acknowledge their own responsibility. They're asking for support, which is a valid request. The mother's responses are dismissive, which is where the issue lies. So, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their concerns and seeking help. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
