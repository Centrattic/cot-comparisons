Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking their mom is overfeeding them. The situation is that the author is obese, lives with their mom who cooks large portions and buys a lot of chocolate. They've tried to talk to their mom about it, but she keeps telling them not to eat it. The author feels like the mom is partly responsible and is seeking advice on whether they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author is 18 and still living with their mom. They have a BMI of around 40, which is classed as morbidly obese. The mom is also obese. The author tries to resist eating the portions but often gives in. They've asked the mom to help, but she blames them and says they just need to not eat it. The mom doesn't seem supportive of trying to lose weight.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they're expressing concern about their health and the environment at home contributing to their weight issue. They're not blaming their mom outright but stating that the situation is making it harder for them. The mom's response is dismissive, which might be part of the problem. The author isn't making their mom do anything; they're asking for support, which the mom isn't providing. The author's actions\u2014trying to manage their own diet and planning to move out\u2014are their own responsibility.\n\nPossible angles: The author isn't in the wrong for recognizing that their environment affects their health. They're seeking help, which is reasonable. The mom's behavior is enabling the issue by overfeeding. The author isn't forcing the mom to act a certain way; they're voicing their needs. The mom is not taking responsibility for her part in providing food that the author can't resist. \n\nAnother thought: The author is taking steps on their own, which shows they're trying. The mom isn't supportive, which isn't the author's fault. The author isn't wrong for wanting a healthier environment. The key issue is the mom's lack of support and the author's attempt to address it. The author isn't the asshole here because they're trying to improve their situation and have communicated their needs. The mom's response is the problem, but that doesn't make the author wrong for expressing their feelings.\n"
