When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for giving their son money without their wife's knowledge. The situation is that the parents agreed to let their son stay at home during university. The dad noticed a disparity in how much the son and wife spent on things. The dad gave the son money secretly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is the dad's actions of giving money without the wife's knowledge. That seems like a breach of trust, especially in a marriage where financial decisions are typically mutual. Even if the dad thought the wife was being unfair to the son, bypassing her and acting behind her back is problematic. \n\nThe context mentions that the family isn't short on money, but there's a perceived imbalance. The dad's response was to secretly support the son, which could be seen as undermining the wife's authority. Communication is key in such situations. Instead of giving money without telling the wife, the dad should have discussed the issue with her. \n\nAlso, the wife's reaction to the son's $7 meal compared to her own $160 perfume purchase might be a point of contention. However, the dad's solution was to bypass the wife entirely, which isn't a healthy approach. Financial decisions in a marriage usually require mutual agreement, and acting unilaterally can lead to resentment and erode trust. \n\nThe son is in university and perhaps learning to manage money, but the dad's intervention without involving the wife might not be the best way to handle it. The wife might have her own reasons for her behavior, and the dad's secret support could be seen as favoritism or undermining her. \n\nSo, even if the dad's intention was to correct a perceived unfairness, the method of doing so without involving the wife is wrong. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because of the lack of communication and the breach of trust in the marital relationship.\n"
