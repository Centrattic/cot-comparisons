When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the father gave his son money without the wife's knowledge. The parents agreed to let their son live at home during university. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, but the father gave the son money secretly. The father is upset because the wife spent $160 on perfume and criticized the son for a much smaller amount.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the father is in the wrong. The key points here are about financial decisions within a marriage and how they affect the family dynamics. The father and wife are supposed to be making joint decisions, especially regarding their son's living arrangements and support. The father gave the son money without informing the wife, which could be seen as undermining her authority or the agreed-upon financial boundaries. \n\nEven though the family isn't in financial trouble, the way the father handled the situation might have been a breach of trust. The wife was upset when she found out about the perfume cost compared to the son's meal. The father's reaction to that might have led him to take matters into his own hands by giving the son money secretly. However, in a marriage, transparency is important. Making financial decisions without the spouse's knowledge can lead to resentment and conflict. \n\nThe father's intention was to help the son, but doing so without the wife's consent might not be right. The wife had a different spending perspective, and the father's action could be seen as not respecting her input or their shared financial responsibilities. The son is an adult, but since he's living at home, the parents might have an agreement on how expenses are handled. The father's secret giving could disrupt that agreement. \n\nOn the other hand, the father might feel that the wife was being overly strict about the son's spending, especially when she spent a lot more on herself. His motivation was to support his son, which is understandable. But the method of doing it without the wife's knowledge is problematic. \n\nIn terms of whether he's in the wrong, it's a judgment call. The father acted out of a desire to support his son but did so in a way that wasn't transparent with his spouse. The answer would likely lean towards \"Yes,\" he is in the wrong because he didn't communicate with his wife about the financial decisions, leading to a lack of trust and potential conflict.\n"
