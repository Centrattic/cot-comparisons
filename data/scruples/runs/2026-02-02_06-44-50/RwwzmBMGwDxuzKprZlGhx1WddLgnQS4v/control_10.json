When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a parent giving money to their son without the spouse's knowledge. The parents agreed to let their son live at home during university. The father noticed the wife was upset with the son for spending $7 on a meal, but the wife spent $160 on perfume. The father then started giving the son money without the wife's consent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the parents' relationship. The wife criticized the son for a small expense but spent much more on herself. The father felt that was unfair and decided to support the son financially. However, he did this without discussing it with his wife, which might have been a mistake because it could lead to conflict or distrust.\n\nMoney management in a household is usually a shared responsibility, especially when there's a joint family. By acting unilaterally, the father might have breached an unwritten agreement or caused the wife to feel disrespected. Even if the wife's actions seemed over-the-top, the proper approach would be to address the issue with her first rather than bypassing her by giving the son money. This could undermine the wife's authority and create further tension.\n\nAdditionally, the son is an adult in university, so it's reasonable for him to manage his own money. However, the parents' role is to support him, but perhaps within the agreed-upon financial framework. The father's action might be seen as taking sides in the financial disagreements, which isn't helpful for family harmony.\n\nSo, while the wife's reaction to the son's $7 meal might be excessive compared to her own spending, the father's solution of secretly giving the son money without involving his wife is problematic. The right approach would be to discuss the discrepancy in spending habits as a couple and find a mutual solution. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not communicating with his wife and for undermining their shared financial decisions.\n"
