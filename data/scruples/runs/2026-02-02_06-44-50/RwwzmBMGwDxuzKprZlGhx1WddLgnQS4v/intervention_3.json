When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the dad gave his son money without the wife knowing. The family isn't poor, but there's a big difference in how each family member handles money. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, while the dad noticed she spent $160 on perfume and confronted her. Then he started secretly giving the son money.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents agreed to let their son live at home during university. The dad felt that the wife was being overly critical of the son's spending, so he decided to give the son extra money to balance things out. But he did it without the wife's knowledge. \n\nNow, the question is whether the dad is in the wrong. The key points are: Did the dad act unilaterally without considering the wife's perspective? By giving money secretly, is he undermining the wife's authority or their agreement as parents? Also, even if the wife's reaction seems extreme (criticizing $7 vs. $160), the dad's response was to take matters into his own hands instead of discussing it with her.\n\nIn a marriage, especially when it comes to finances and parenting decisions, communication is crucial. The dad might have thought he was helping the son, but doing so without his wife's knowledge could lead to distrust. The wife might feel disrespected or that her concerns about money management aren't being addressed. Even if the dad's intentions were good, the method (acting behind the wife's back) could be problematic. \n\nAdditionally, the parents should be on the same page about how to handle their son's finances. If the dad thinks the wife is being too strict, maybe they should have a conversation about that instead of him secretly giving money. The son might also be caught in the middle if the parents aren't united in their approach.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's reaction to the $7 meal versus her own $160 perfume does seem disproportionate. The dad had a valid point about fairness. However, instead of giving money in secret, he could have addressed the issue with the wife directly, perhaps suggesting a more balanced approach to money management for the son. \n\nSo, the dad's action of giving money without the wife's knowledge might be seen as the wrong because it lacks transparency and could cause marital tension. Even if his intentions were to support the son and correct an imbalance, the method was not collaborative. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
