When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving their son money secretly without the wife's knowledge. The situation involves the parents allowing the son to live at home while attending university. The wife criticizes the son for a $7 meal, and the father gives the son money separately, which he thinks is fair because his wife spent $160 on perfume.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents are in a marriage where they presumably share financial responsibilities. Even if the family has enough money, the wife's reaction to the son's spending might reflect her views on budgeting or teaching financial responsibility. The father's response is to privately give the son money, which could be seen as undermining the wife's authority in managing finances.\n\nThe father's action of not informing his wife about giving money to the son might be a breach of trust. In a marriage, major financial decisions typically involve both partners. Even though the father is motivated by a perceived inconsistency (wife spending more), he didn't discuss this with her first. By acting unilaterally, he's not being transparent, which can lead to resentment and conflict.\n\nAlso, the son is an adult, so perhaps the father is trying to support his independence. However, the method of doing so without the wife's knowledge is problematic. The wife might feel that her input or rules are being bypassed. The father's approach might be seen as a way to avoid conflict but could create more issues in the marriage.\n\nAnother angle: the wife's criticism of the son's $7 meal versus her own $160 perfume. The father's point is about fairness, but perhaps the wife's perspective is about budgeting or personal choices. The father might not understand her reasoning, leading to his frustration. However, instead of addressing it directly with her, he handles it behind her back by giving the son money, which doesn't resolve the underlying issue and might exacerbate marital tensions.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the father's action is a problem because it's about secrecy and not respecting the wife's role in family finances. Even if his intentions are good, the method is flawed. The wife might feel disrespected or that her concerns are being dismissed, leading to more conflict. So, the author is in the wrong for not being transparent and for handling the situation without involving his wife.\n"
