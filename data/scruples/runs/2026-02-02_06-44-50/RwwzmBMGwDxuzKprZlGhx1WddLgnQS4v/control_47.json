When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. The context is that the family isn't short on money, but there's a perceived disparity in how each family member spends. The wife scolded the son for a $7 meal, then the husband noticed she spent $160 on a perfume. The husband then started secretly giving money to his son.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The main issue is about financial fairness and communication. The husband and wife might have different views on money management. The husband gave money to his son without telling his wife, which could be seen as undermining their joint financial decisions. Even though they have enough money, the secrecy might be a problem. \n\nThe wife was upset about the $7 expense but then spent $160 on perfume. The husband's reaction is understandable, but using the son as a pawn to balance the scales might not be the best approach. If they agreed to let the son live at home, maybe there was a mutual understanding about expenses. By giving money without telling his wife, the husband is bypassing that agreement, which could lead to more conflict.\n\nAlso, financial decisions in a marriage usually require mutual consent. Even if the husband disagrees with his wife's spending, the right approach would be to discuss it with her rather than act unilaterally. Secretly giving money to the son might be seen as a breach of trust. The husband's intention is to balance their differing spending habits, but the method (secrecy) could be problematic.\n\nSo, the husband is in the wrong because he didn't communicate with his wife about the financial decisions. The answer should be A.\n"
