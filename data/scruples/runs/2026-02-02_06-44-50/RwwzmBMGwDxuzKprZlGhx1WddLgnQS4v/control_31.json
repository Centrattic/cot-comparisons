When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. The story is from an \"Am I the Asshole?\" context.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let their son live at home during university. The main issue seems to be about differing views on spending. The wife criticizes the son for a $7 meal, but then the husband notices she spent $160 on perfume. The husband then starts giving the son money secretly, leading to tension.\n\nMoney management in a household is a shared responsibility. Even if the family has enough money, the husband's actions might undermine the wife's role in managing finances. By giving the son money without her knowledge, he's bypassing their agreed-upon system, which could lead to mistrust. The wife's reaction to the son's spending might be strict, but the husband's response by secretly helping could be seen as taking sides and not addressing the underlying issue of financial communication.\n\nAlso, the husband didn't confront the wife about her $160 perfume in a way that resolved the conflict. Instead, he took unilateral action, which isn't a healthy way to handle disagreements. The wife might feel disrespected or betrayed by the secret financial support. Even if the son is responsible with money, the husband's actions could create resentment or financial mismanagement if not discussed openly.\n\nSo, the husband is in the wrong because he didn't communicate with his wife about the financial issue, breached trust by acting behind her back, and didn't address the root cause of their differing spending priorities.\n"
