When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent giving money to their son without the wife's knowledge. The key points are:\n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let the son stay at home while attending university. The family isn't lacking money, but there's a big difference in how each member spends. The wife criticized the son for a $7 meal, but then the father found out she spent $160 on perfume. The father then started giving the son money secretly because he felt the wife's reaction was unfair.\n\nSo, the question is whether the father is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The father's action was to give money to his son without the wife's knowledge. The wife had a different approach to managing money, which the father found inconsistent. But does that justify bypassing his wife?\n\nMarriage usually involves shared financial decisions, especially when it comes to children. Even if the wife's criticism of the son's spending seemed harsh, the father's response of giving money secretly might undermine their agreement to support the son. By not discussing it with his wife, he's creating a separate financial arrangement without her consent, which could lead to more conflict. The wife might feel betrayed if she finds out, especially if she had concerns about the son's spending habits. The father's intention was to balance the perceived unfairness, but the method (without communication) is problematic. \n\nAlso, the fact that the family isn't short on money doesn't negate the importance of mutual agreement. The wife might have her reasons for being strict on the son's spending, even if she spends more on herself. The father's action could be seen as taking sides and not respecting their shared responsibility in parenting. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he bypassed his wife in a financial decision that affects their family's shared responsibilities and communication.\n"
