When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. The story is about a family where the parents agreed to let their son live at home while he's in university. The dad is giving the son money secretly, and the wife is upset about the son spending $7, while the dad is upset when he finds out the wife spent $160 on perfume.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents have agreed to let the son stay at home, and they have enough money. The issue seems to be about financial fairness between the parents and the son. The dad is giving the son money without the wife knowing, which is the core of the problem here.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the dad is in the wrong by giving the son money without the wife's knowledge. Let's break it down. In a marriage, financial decisions are typically considered shared responsibilities. If the parents are cohabiting and the son is living at home, it's possible that they had some agreement about expenses. If the dad starts giving the son money without the wife's knowledge, that could be seen as undermining their shared financial management. \n\nThe wife's reaction to the son's $7 meal might be about budgeting or teaching financial responsibility. The dad's reaction to her perfume price seems to be about perceived double standards. However, the key point is that the dad is giving money secretly. This could lead to mistrust in the marriage, especially if the wife is not involved in those decisions. \n\nEven if the son is mature and uses the money responsibly, the act of giving money without the spouse's knowledge could be problematic. The couple might have different financial values or strategies, and by acting unilaterally, the dad might be violating an implicit trust. \n\nAdditionally, the father's approach to the wife about the perfume might have been confrontational. Instead of addressing the issue calmly, he closed the door and pointed out the discrepancy, which might have escalated the situation. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the wife was reprimanding the son for a small expense, and the dad felt it was unfair compared to her own purchase. However, the dad's solution was to give the son money without the wife knowing, which doesn't resolve the underlying issue of differing financial perspectives. It might even create more conflict if the wife finds out. \n\nSo, considering that the dad is making financial decisions for their son without the wife's consent, and in a way that could be seen as secretive and undermining their partnership, it's likely that the dad is in the wrong. The right approach might have been to discuss the financial discrepancies openly with the wife and reach a mutual agreement on how to handle the son's expenses.\n"
