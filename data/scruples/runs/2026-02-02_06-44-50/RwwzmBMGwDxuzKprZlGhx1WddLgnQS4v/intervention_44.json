When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. The situation is about parents and their son during university. \n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let the son live at home while at university. The family is not struggling financially, but there's a big disproportion in how each family member's money is managed. For example, the wife scolds the son for spending $7 on a meal, but then the author finds out she spent $160 on perfume. The author confronts her, which leads to an argument. Then, the author starts giving the son money secretly.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author is giving money without the wife's knowledge, there's a discrepancy in how they handle expenses, and the author feels the wife is being unfair. The author justifies it by saying the son is mature and uses the money responsibly, not on harmful things.\n\nNow, considering family dynamics and communication. The author and wife are a couple, and financial matters usually require mutual agreement, especially if they have joint responsibilities or shared finances. The author's action of giving money without the wife's knowledge could be seen as undermining her authority or creating a divide. Even if the author believes the wife is being unreasonable, the right approach would be to address the issue together, not bypass her.\n\nAlso, the son is an adult now in university, so it's reasonable for him to have some financial independence. However, the parent's decision to provide extra funds without the other parent's knowledge might cause tension in the marriage. The wife might feel disrespected or that her financial concerns aren't being taken seriously. The author's response to the wife's criticism by confronting her about the perfume might have escalated the conflict, leading to the current situation.\n\nThe author's justification is that the son is responsible, but the method of providing funds without the wife's consent is problematic. In a marriage, transparency in financial decisions is important to maintain trust and avoid resentment. The author might be trying to protect the son from their wife's strictness, but doing so behind her back could be seen as a breach of marital trust. \n\nOn the other hand, if the wife was indeed being overly critical and the author felt it necessary to support the son, there's a case for wanting to help. However, the right approach would be to discuss and resolve the financial management issues as a couple rather than acting unilaterally. The secrecy is likely to cause more harm than good in the long run.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author is in the wrong for not involving their wife in the decision and for acting secretly. The correct answer should be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
