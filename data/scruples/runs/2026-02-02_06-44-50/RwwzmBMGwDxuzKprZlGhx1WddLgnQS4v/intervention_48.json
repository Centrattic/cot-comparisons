When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for giving their son money without their wife's knowledge. They mention that their son is living at home while attending university, and the family isn't struggling financially. The main issue seems to be a disagreement over spending habits.\n\nThe user says their wife criticized their son for spending $7 on a meal, but then the user found out she spent $160 on perfume. They felt this was unfair and decided to give the son extra money secretly. The son uses the money responsibly for food and entertainment. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the marriage. The user and his wife had an agreement for the son to stay at home, but the user is bypassing the wife by giving the son money without her knowing. That could be a problem because it might undermine their joint agreement. Even if the user thinks the wife is being overly strict, the act of giving money without her consent could be seen as disrespectful. \n\nFinancial disagreements are common in relationships, but transparency is key. By not discussing this with his wife, the user might be creating a situation where they're not on the same page. The wife might feel disrespected or that her input isn't valued. Also, the son might be confused if the parents have conflicting approaches to managing finances. \n\nThe user's intention was to help the son, but the method involved deception. Even if the son is using the money well, the parents should agree on how to support him. The wife's criticism might be harsh, but the user's response to it by secretly providing funds could lead to more conflict. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the user is pointing out the wife's own spending, but that's not really the issue here. The core problem is the unauthorized giving of money. So, while the wife's reaction could be questioned, the user's action of not informing her is a breach of trust. \n\nTherefore, the answer would likely be that the user is in the wrong because they didn't communicate with their spouse and acted behind her back, which is generally considered a mistake in a relationship.\n"
