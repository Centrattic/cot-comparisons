When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a dad giving money to his son without his wife's knowledge. The parents agreed to let their son live at home during university. The wife seems to be upset when the son spends $7 on a meal, but the dad notices that she spent $160 on perfume. He then gives the son money secretly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are about fairness and transparency in financial matters. The author's intention was to support his son, but he did it without the wife's knowledge. The wife's reaction to the son's spending versus her own might be seen as hypocritical, which the dad points out. However, the dad's response was to bypass his wife entirely by giving the son money secretly.\n\nIn a marriage, especially when it comes to shared responsibilities like supporting a child, communication is usually important. Even if the wife's behavior seems inconsistent, the dad's choice to act unilaterally without discussing it with her could be problematic. It might undermine the wife's authority as a parent and create a rift between the couple. The fact that they agreed to let the son stay at home suggests they had a mutual agreement about supporting him, but this could have included how expenses are managed. If the dad thinks the wife is being too strict, he should address it with her, not around her. By giving money in secret, he's not only circumventing his wife but also potentially setting a precedent for the son that it's okay to take money without transparency.\n\nOn the other hand, the dad might feel that the wife is being unreasonable. The $7 vs. $160 example does highlight a possible double standard. However, dealing with that issue through direct communication rather than secretly providing funds is the healthier approach. The son is at university and might need financial guidance, so having both parents involved could be beneficial. The dad's action might lead to a lack of trust between him and his wife, as well as confusion for the son about where the money is coming from and why the mom is upset when the dad is secretly helping.\n\nSo, even though the dad's intention was to support his son and correct a perceived unfairness, the method of doing so without the wife's knowledge is where the problem lies. It's important for couples to handle family finances together to maintain trust and consistency in parenting. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because he didn't communicate with his wife and instead acted behind her back, which can damage the relationship and set a bad example.\n"
