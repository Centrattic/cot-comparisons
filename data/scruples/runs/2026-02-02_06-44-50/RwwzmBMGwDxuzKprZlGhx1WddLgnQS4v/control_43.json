When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the main issue is that the father gave his son money without his wife's knowledge. The parents agreed that the son would stay at their house during university. The family's finances aren't an issue, but there's a big disparity in how each family member spends. The wife scolded the son for spending $7 on a meal, but then the father found out she spent $160 on perfume. He got upset and started giving his son money secretly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents are supposed to be a united front, right? If they're not on the same page about finances, that could cause problems. The father's action of giving money without telling the wife might be seen as undermining her authority. Even though the wife was being strict about the son's spending, the father's response is to bypass her entirely. That could be a problem because they're both parents and should probably make joint decisions about their child's finances.\n\nThen there's the aspect of fairness. The father is pointing out the hypocrisy by comparing $7 to $160, which makes sense. But instead of addressing the issue with his wife in a constructive way, he's giving money to the son behind her back. That might be a way to support the son, but it's also a secret. The wife might feel disrespected or not trusted with the finances, which could hurt their relationship.\n\nAlso, the son is in university and might be learning financial responsibility. If the father is giving him money without the mother's knowledge, the son might not be learning to manage his own money properly. The mother's approach might be strict, but she's trying to teach him to be careful. The father's intervention might be counterproductive if the goal is to help the son become financially responsible.\n\nOn the other hand, the father might feel that his wife is being overly critical, and he's trying to support his son's independence. But the method of giving money without consulting the wife could be a mistake. Open communication between the parents would be better. The father should address the wife's behavior and discuss their approach to the son's spending together, rather than acting alone.\n\nSo, the main points are: the parents should be united in raising their child, secret actions can create tension, and the approach to financial education for the son needs consistency. The father's action might be coming from a good place, but the method is problematic. Therefore, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
