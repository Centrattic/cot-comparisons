When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge.\n\nFirst, the situation: The parents agreed to let their son live at home while he's in university. The family isn't poor, but there's a big difference in how each family member spends. The wife criticizes the son for spending $7 on a meal, while she spent $160 on perfume. The husband is upset about this disparity and starts giving the son money secretly, without the wife's knowledge. The son uses the money responsibly.\n\nSo, the key points here. The husband is acting out of a sense of fairness. He sees the wife being critical of the son for a small expense while she spends a lot more on herself. His response is to provide the son with money to have more financial freedom. But he does it without the wife's knowledge, which might be a problem in a shared household.\n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is wrong. In a marriage, financial decisions are typically considered joint. Even if the husband has his own money, giving the son money without the wife's knowledge could be seen as undermining her authority or creating tension. The wife might feel that the husband is taking sides or not respecting her role in managing family finances.\n\nBut the husband's intention is to correct what he sees as an unfair double standard. However, the method\u2014doing it without the wife's consent\u2014might be the issue. It's possible that a better approach would have been to discuss the spending habits with his wife first, rather than bypassing her.\n\nAlso, the husband's action of giving the son money could be seen as a way to support the son's independence, which is positive. But the secrecy might be causing more harm by creating distrust. The wife's reaction (getting upset and going to the bathroom) suggests that she felt disrespected or that her concerns weren't validated.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the husband's actions are well-intentioned but the method is problematic. The wrong here would be in not communicating with his wife and handling the situation as a team. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he acted unilaterally without considering the marital partnership in financial matters.\n"
