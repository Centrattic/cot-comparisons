When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for giving their son money without their wife's knowledge. The situation is about differing spending habits and parental control.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let their son live at home during university. The wife is upset about the son spending $7 on a meal, while the father spends time with the son and later gives him money secretly. The wife then spends $160 on perfume, which the father points out as hypocritical. The father then starts giving the son money without the wife knowing.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the father is bypassing the wife's authority by giving the son money behind her back. Even though the wife's criticism of the son's spending seems harsh (spending $7 vs. $160), the father's solution is to act unilaterally without discussing it with his wife. That's a problem because it undermines their partnership. Parents should ideally be on the same page about financial decisions, especially involving their child. The father's actions could lead to more conflict and a lack of trust. Even if the wife's reaction was excessive, the father shouldn't have taken matters into his own hands without communication. So, the father is in the wrong because he didn't address the issue through discussion but instead acted secretly, which is a breach of trust and cooperation between spouses.\n"
