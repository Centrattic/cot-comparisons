When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who gave their son money without the wife's knowledge is in the wrong. The scenario is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the husband and wife had an agreement for their son to stay at home during university. The husband mentions that money isn't an issue for their household, but there's a big difference in how each family member spends. The wife reprimanded the son for spending $7 on a meal, but the husband later finds out she spent $160 on perfume. This discrepancy led the husband to secretly give the son money to avoid the wife's criticism.\n\nNow, the key points to consider are: Did the husband act within the boundaries of the agreed-upon rules? The parents had an agreement that the son would stay at home, and presumably, the financial responsibilities were part of that agreement. If the wife had a say in the son's expenses, then the husband giving money without her knowledge might be a breach of that agreement. \n\nAlso, the husband's actions could be seen as undermining his wife's authority. By giving the son money behind her back, he's not only disrespecting her but also potentially confusing the son about financial boundaries. Even if the wife's criticism seems harsh (spending $7 vs. $160), the husband's response of secretly providing funds might not be the healthiest approach. \n\nMoreover, the husband's justification is that the son is responsible with money. However, the parents as a unit should present a united front when it comes to financial matters. The husband's decision to act unilaterally could lead to resentment or conflict between the spouses. \n\nOn the other hand, if the couple didn't have a clear agreement about the son's expenses, maybe the husband felt it was necessary to balance the wife's strictness. But even then, transparency is important in a marriage. Acting without the spouse's knowledge can erode trust.\n\nSo, considering the need for marital communication and agreement on parenting decisions, the husband is probably in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
