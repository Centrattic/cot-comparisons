When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the dad gave his son money without the wife's knowledge. The wife was upset about the son spending $7 on a meal, while she spent $160 on perfume. The dad thinks that's unfair and decided to secretly give the son money to help him out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents agreed to let the son live at home during university, which is a big support. The dad mentions that their household has enough money, but there's a big disproportion in how each family member spends. The wife is being critical of the son's $7 meal, but she spends $160 on perfume. The dad feels this is unfair and wants to support his son.\n\nNow, the key points here are about fairness and communication. The dad is trying to address what he sees as an imbalance by giving the son money without telling his wife. But the problem is that he did it without her knowledge. Even though the wife's reaction might be over the top (since $7 is a small amount compared to her $160 perfume), the dad's action of giving money without telling her is a breach of trust. \n\nIn a marriage, financial decisions, especially involving children, should ideally be discussed and agreed upon together. By not communicating with his wife, the dad is creating a secret arrangement that could lead to more conflict. Even if his intention is to support his son and correct an imbalance, the method he chose (without transparency) is problematic. \n\nThe wife's criticism of the son's spending might be harsh, but that doesn't necessarily justify the dad's unilateral action. The proper approach would have been to talk to his wife about their differing views on spending and find a solution together, rather than acting in secrecy. \n\nSo, the dad's action of giving money without his wife's knowledge is likely the wrong move, even if his intentions were good. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
