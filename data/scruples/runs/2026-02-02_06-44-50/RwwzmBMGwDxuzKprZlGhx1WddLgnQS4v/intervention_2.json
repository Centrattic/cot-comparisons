When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, a parent, gave their son money without the wife's knowledge. The wife had been upset with the son for spending $7 on a meal, while the author noticed that the wife spent $160 on perfume herself. The author then decided to give the son money secretly to help him out, thinking it was unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The family isn't struggling financially, but there's a big difference in how much each member spends. The wife is criticizing the son for a small expense, but she herself spent a lot more. The author feels this is hypocritical and wants to support the son, so he gives him money without the wife knowing. \n\nNow, the key issues here are: 1) Was the author wrong to give the son money without the wife's knowledge? 2) Was the wife's reaction to the son's spending appropriate? 3) Did the author act correctly in addressing the perceived unfairness?\n\nIn many relationships, finances are a shared responsibility. If the parents have agreed to let the son stay at home during university, perhaps there's an unspoken or explicit agreement on how expenses will be handled. The author's action of giving the son money without the wife's knowledge could be seen as undermining the wife's role in managing the household finances. Even if the author disagrees with the wife's approach, going behind her back might not be the best way to handle it.\n\nAlso, the wife spending $160 on perfume might be a choice she makes, perhaps for her own enjoyment or as a treat. The author is pointing out the discrepancy, but that doesn't necessarily mean the wife was wrong. People can have different values and spending priorities. The son using $7 on a meal is a small amount, and if the family has the means, maybe the wife's criticism is unnecessary. However, the author's solution of secretly giving the son money might create more problems, like lack of trust in the marriage.\n\nAnother angle: if the parents aren't in agreement about financial matters, especially regarding their child, it could lead to conflict. The author might have a valid point about fairness, but the method of addressing it (without the wife's knowledge) could be problematic. Open communication would be better. Instead of secretly giving money, discussing the issue with the wife and finding a mutual solution would be more constructive.\n\nSo, the author's action of giving the son money without the wife's knowledge might be seen as wrong because it's dishonest and could harm the relationship. The author could have addressed the wife's behavior by talking to her directly, rather than taking matters into their own hands. The wife's spending might be a separate issue, but the author's method of handling it is questionable.\n"
