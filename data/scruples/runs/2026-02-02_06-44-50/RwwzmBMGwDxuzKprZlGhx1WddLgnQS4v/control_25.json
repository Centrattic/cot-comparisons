When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for giving their son money secretly. Let me go through the details.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let their son live at home during university. They have enough money, but there's a big discrepancy in how each family member's money is handled. The wife criticizes the son for spending $7 on a meal, while the dad secretly gives the son money. The dad got upset when he found out the wife spent $160 on perfume, thinking it's unfair compared to the son's $7. \n\nSo, the main issue here is about fairness and communication. The dad gave money to the son without the wife's knowledge, which could be seen as undermining her authority. The wife might see the dad as favoring the son, especially after her criticism. The dad's action of not informing the wife might be causing tension in their marriage.\n\nBut wait, the dad's intention was to help the son, not to make the wife look bad. The problem is that he didn't communicate with his wife about this decision. Even if they have enough money, the wife might feel that the spending habits are inconsistent and that her role in managing the family's finances isn't respected. \n\nAlso, the wife's initial reaction to the son might be harsh, but that's another aspect. However, the dad's solution was to secretly support the son, which could lead to more conflict. The key here is the lack of communication. In a shared household, financial decisions usually require mutual agreement, even if one parent thinks the other is being too strict. \n\nSo, even if the dad's intention was good, acting without the wife's knowledge is problematic. It's about respecting each other's roles and discussing family matters together. The answer would be that the dad is in the wrong because he didn't communicate his actions with his wife, which is essential in a marriage.\n"
