When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario is about a father giving his son money without the wife's knowledge. They agreed to let the son stay at home during university, and the wife seems to be strict about money, criticizing the son for a $7 meal. The father then gives the son money secretly because he feels the wife's reaction is unfair compared to her spending $160 on perfume.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the father is wrong. Let's break it down. The wife is upset about the son spending $7, but she herself spent $160 on perfume. The father thinks that's unfair, so he gives the son money without telling her. The key points here are about fairness, communication in the relationship, and possibly the parents' control over finances.\n\nThe parents are in a shared household, so financial decisions are usually a joint responsibility. The father gave the son money without consulting his wife, which might be a breach of trust. Even though the wife's behavior is questionable, the father's actions might be wrong if he didn't communicate with her. The fact that the wife is being inconsistent (upset about $7 but spends $160) is a red flag, but does that justify the father acting without her knowledge?\n\nAlso, the son is a mature adult, so maybe the parents have given him some independence. However, the parents might have different views on how to handle their child's expenses. The father's approach could lead to arguments because the wife isn't aware. It's important to consider the impact on the marriage. If one parent is making financial decisions without the other, that can cause resentment. \n\nThe father might have felt strongly about the son's situation, but the right approach would be to discuss it with his wife first. By giving the money secretly, he might be undermining her and the agreement they had. Even if the wife is being unreasonable, addressing it openly is better than acting behind her back. \n\nSo, the father's intention is good, trying to support his son, but the method is problematic because it lacks communication. The answer would likely be that he's in the wrong because he didn't talk to his wife, leading to potential trust issues and conflict. The inconsistency in the wife's spending is a separate issue that should be discussed between the couple rather than the father taking unilateral action.\n"
