When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. The story is about a family where money isn't an issue, but there's a perceived discrepancy in how each family member spends. The son spends $7 on a meal, and the wife spends $160 on perfume. The father talks to the son, tells him not to worry, and then later gives the son money secretly.\n\nFirst, the father's action of giving money without the wife's knowledge is key here. Since they're a household, financial decisions usually require mutual agreement, especially if they're co-parenting. The wife was upset about the son's spending, so the father's response was to secretly fund him, which might be seen as undermining her authority. \n\nThe father's reasoning is about fairness, pointing out the wife's own spending. However, the way he handled it\u2014closing the kitchen door and confronting her\u2014could have been confrontational. Then, giving the son money without discussing it with the wife might be seen as taking sides without addressing the underlying issue of communication.\n\nMoney management in a marriage is typically a shared responsibility. Even if the father feels the wife is being unfair, the right approach would be to discuss it with her rather than act unilaterally. The son's maturity is noted, but the father's decision to bypass the wife could lead to more conflict. \n\nSo, the father's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, might be seen as inconsiderate of the wife's feelings and the family's financial dynamics. The answer is likely A (in the wrong) because he didn't communicate with his wife and acted secretly, which could harm their relationship.\n"
