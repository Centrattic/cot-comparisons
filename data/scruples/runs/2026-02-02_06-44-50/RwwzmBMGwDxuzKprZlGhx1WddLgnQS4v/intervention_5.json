When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the parent gave their son money without the wife's knowledge. The wife is upset because the son spent $7 on a meal, but she spent $160 on perfume. The parent thinks the wife is unfair, so they started giving the son money secretly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents are supposed to be a team when it comes to parenting and managing finances. If one parent is making decisions without the other, especially involving money, that could be a problem. The author's motivation seems to be trying to correct what they see as unfair treatment by the wife. But by giving the son money without telling the wife, they're bypassing the other parent, which might undermine the wife's authority and the family's financial planning.\n\nThe wife's reaction to the $7 meal versus her perfume purchase might be about different priorities. Maybe the $7 is part of a pattern of what the wife considers unnecessary spending, while her perfume is a personal expense she values. The parent might think the wife is being hypocritical, but that doesn't necessarily justify giving money without consent. Financial decisions usually require mutual agreement, especially in a household where money isn't an issue but distribution is. The parent's action could create resentment or conflict, even if their intention was to help the son.\n\nAlso, the son is a mature adult, but being in university, they might still be learning financial management. Providing secret funds might not be the best approach for teaching responsibility. The parent might be trying to support their son, but doing it behind the wife's back could lead to bigger issues in the marriage.\n\nSo, even though the parent might have good intentions, acting without the spouse's knowledge is likely the wrong approach. The right step would be to address the wife's behavior directly and work on family financial agreements rather than bypassing her.\n"
