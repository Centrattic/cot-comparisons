When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the dad gave his son money without the wife's knowledge. The wife was upset about the son spending $7 on a meal but bought perfume for $160. The dad felt the spending was unfair, so he started giving the son money secretly. \n\nFirst, the main issue is whether the dad did something wrong by giving money without the wife's knowledge. In a marriage, especially when it comes to shared finances or major family decisions, communication is key. If the couple hasn't discussed how they manage money regarding their children, then one parent acting without the other's knowledge could be a problem. \n\nThe wife criticized the son for $7, but the dad saw her spending $160 on perfume. That discrepancy might have made him feel she's being unfair. However, instead of addressing the issue with his wife directly, he decided to give the son money secretly. That could be seen as taking matters into his own hands without involving his spouse, which might lead to more conflict.\n\nAlso, the dad mentioned they have enough money, but there's a big imbalance in how each family member is treated. The son is a university student living at home, so maybe the parents had an agreement about expenses. If the wife was the one handling finances (like grocery money or meal budgets), then the dad giving extra money without her knowledge might disrupt that system. \n\nBut on the other hand, the dad might feel that the wife's criticism was hypocritical, and he wanted to support his son's independence. The son is using the money responsibly, so the dad's intention was good. However, the method\u2014doing it without the wife's knowledge\u2014could be the problem. It's important to have these conversations as a couple to find a fair solution rather than one parent acting alone.\n\nSo, the key points are: acting without communication, potential hypocrisy in the wife's spending, and the intention to help the son. The dad's action might not be malicious, but the lack of transparency with his spouse is a mistake. Therefore, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because bypassing the partner's knowledge in financial matters is problematic, even if the motive is good.\n"
