When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. The scenario is about a couple letting their son live at home during university. The husband gives the son money secretly because he's upset about the wife spending $160 on perfume while criticizing the son for $7.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The main issue seems to be about financial fairness and communication. The husband is trying to even out the perceived disparity in spending between the wife and their son. But he did it without consulting his wife, which is a problem. \n\nIn a marriage, joint financial decisions are typically expected, especially when it involves the children's finances. The husband's actions could lead to mistrust because he's taking matters into his own hands without discussing it with his spouse. Even if his intention was to correct an imbalance, the method of doing so without transparency is questionable. \n\nThe wife criticized the son for a small expense but spent a much larger amount on perfume. The husband's frustration is understandable, but the response of giving money secretly might not address the root issue, which is the wife's behavior. Instead of creating a separate problem by acting behind her back, the husband should have addressed the issue directly with his wife, perhaps discussing their values around spending and setting boundaries together for the son's expenses.\n\nAlso, the son is an adult attending university, so giving him money might be a way to support his independence. However, the husband's approach could complicate the family's financial management and lead to conflicts. The wife might feel disrespected or undermined, which can strain the marital relationship more than the original issue.\n\nSo, the husband's intentions might be good, but the action of bypassing his wife is problematic. The right approach would involve open communication and mutual agreement on how to handle the son's finances. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not discussing this with his wife first.\n"
