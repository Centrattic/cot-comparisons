When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is a parent who gave their son money without the wife's knowledge. They mention that money isn't an obstacle in their household, but there's a big disproportion in how each family member spends. For example, the son spent $7 on a meal and got scolded by the wife, while the wife spent $160 on perfume. The author felt this was unfair and decided to secretly support the son by giving him money, which the son uses responsibly for things like food and entertainment.\n\nNow, considering family dynamics and communication, the key issue here is whether the author should have kept their son's financial support a secret from their wife. The wife was upset about the $7 meal, which might indicate she's more concerned about the son's spending habits. The author, instead of addressing this with the wife, chose to bypass her and give money directly to the son. \n\nIn most households, financial decisions are made jointly by partners, especially when it involves their children. Even though the author might have good intentions, not discussing this with their wife could be seen as undermining her authority or not respecting her perspective. The wife's reaction to the son's $7 purchase versus her own $160 on perfume suggests there might be different spending priorities or values, but that's a discussion each couple has. The author's unilateral action might have caused unnecessary conflict. \n\nAdditionally, giving money to the son without the wife's knowledge could lead to mistrust. The wife might feel that the author is not being transparent, which is a big issue in relationships. Even if the author felt the wife was being unfair, the right approach would be to communicate and find a solution together, like setting a budget for the son or discussing the wife's spending habits. \n\nThe son is described as a mature adult, so maybe he should be learning to manage his own finances. However, the parents might have agreed on certain terms when allowing him to stay at home. If the wife was upset about the $7, perhaps there was an unspoken expectation of the son contributing or managing expenses in a way the wife finds appropriate. The author's intervention might have disrupted that. \n\nSo, even though the author's intention was to support the son and correct what they saw as unfair treatment, the method of doing so without involving the wife is problematic. It's about respecting the partnership and ensuring that both parents are on the same page regarding financial matters related to their children. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't communicate with their wife first.\n"
