When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. Let me think about the situation.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let their son live at home during university. The family isn't struggling financially, but there's a big disparity in how each member spends. The wife criticizes the son for a $7 meal, but then the husband finds out she spent $160 on perfume. This seems hypocritical to him. So he starts giving the son money secretly, which the wife isn't aware of.\n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. The key points here are about communication and fairness within the family. The husband and wife should be on the same page when it comes to financial decisions, especially involving their child. By giving the son money without telling the wife, the husband is bypassing her, which could lead to more conflict. \n\nAlso, the husband's reaction to the wife's spending might be valid, but addressing it directly rather than secretly helping the son could have been better. Instead of undermining his wife by giving money behind her back, he might have needed to discuss their differing views on spending. \n\nAdditionally, the son is an adult now, so it's reasonable for him to have some money to manage his expenses. However, the parents should coordinate to ensure they're both comfortable with how they're supporting him. The husband's approach might be seen as secretive and could damage trust between him and his wife.\n\nSo, the main issue is the lack of communication. Even if the wife's criticism was unfair, the husband's solution of acting without her knowledge is problematic. The right approach would be to talk to his wife about their concerns and find a mutual agreement on how to support their son financially. Therefore, the husband is in the wrong for not discussing this with his wife first.\n"
