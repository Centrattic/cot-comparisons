When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. The situation is that the parents agreed to let their son live at home during university. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, while the author noticed she spent $160 on perfume. The author then gave the son money secretly because he felt the wife was being unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is a parent, so giving money to a child might be seen as natural, but the key point is doing it without the spouse's knowledge. The wife's criticism of the son's spending versus her own higher expense might be a point of contention. The author feels the wife is being hypocritical, which led him to act.\n\nBut where's the line? The author's action of giving money secretly could be seen as undermining the wife's authority as a parent. Even if the wife's reaction seems harsh to the author, it's important that both parents are on the same page when it comes to managing finances and parenting decisions. The author's decision to bypass the wife might cause more conflict in the marriage than it resolves. The wife might feel disrespected or that her opinions aren't valued, which could strain their relationship more than the $7 issue.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they have enough money, but the disproportion in how each family member spends is a problem. However, parents should ideally discuss these issues openly rather than one parent making unilateral decisions. The act of giving money without informing the spouse might lead to trust issues. Even if the son uses the money responsibly, the secrecy is a problem in the marital context.\n\nSo, even if the wife's reaction was disproportionate, the author's method of addressing it by acting behind her back is wrong. Parents should collaborate on such matters. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
