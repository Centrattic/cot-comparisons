When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband gave money to his son without the wife knowing. They both agreed to let the son live at home during university. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, and then the husband felt defensive because she spent $160 on perfume. So he started giving the son money secretly.\n\nHmm. First, the husband and wife are supposed to be in a partnership, right? So making financial decisions without the other person's knowledge might be an issue. Even if they have enough money, the wife was upset about the son's spending. The husband's response was to secretly give money, which could be seen as undermining the wife's authority. The wife's reaction to the $7 meal might be about teaching the son to be mindful of money, while the husband thinks it's unfair compared to her spending. But the key point here is the husband acting without consulting the wife. \n\nIn a marriage, finances are usually a shared responsibility. Even if there's a disagreement, the right approach would be to discuss it with the wife instead of taking unilateral action. The husband's action of giving money without her knowledge could be seen as crossing a boundary. The wife might feel disrespected or that her concerns aren't being addressed properly. Even if the husband's intention was to support the son, doing it behind the wife's back is likely to cause more problems. \n\nSo the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because he acted without his wife's knowledge and possibly undermined their joint approach to managing family finances and parenting decisions.\n"
