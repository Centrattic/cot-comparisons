When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. The situation is that the couple agreed to let their son stay at home during university. The wife seems to be strict about the son's spending, like $7 on a meal, while the father gives the son money secretly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if giving money to the son without the wife's knowledge is problematic. The parents had an agreement about him staying at home, so maybe they also had some understanding about financial support. If the wife is upset about the son's spending, but the father is giving him money to cover those expenses, that might be a conflict in their parenting approach.\n\nThe father's reasoning is that the family isn't short on money, but there's a discrepancy in how each member's spending is viewed. The wife spends $160 on perfume, which the father found unfair compared to the son's $7 meal. But the act of giving money without the wife's consent could be seen as undermining her authority or the agreed-upon rules. Even if the father thinks it's for the son's benefit, sharing financial decisions with a spouse is usually important to maintain trust and mutual understanding.\n\nAlso, the son is using the money responsibly, but that doesn't necessarily justify the father's secret action. The wife might feel that the financial responsibility should be shared or discussed between both parents. The father's response to the wife's comment about the perfume by pointing out her spending might have contributed to the tension, leading him to take matters into his own hands. However, the right approach would be to address the issue together as a couple rather than bypassing her.\n\nSo, the father might be in the wrong because he didn't communicate with his wife about the financial support, even though his intentions were good. The key issue is the lack of transparency and teamwork in handling their son's finances. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
