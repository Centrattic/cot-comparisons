When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that a dad gave his son money without telling his wife. The parents agreed to let their son live at home during university. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, while the dad spent $160 on perfume. The dad felt the spending was unfair and started giving the son money secretly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the family dynamics. The parents are supposed to be a united front, right? So if one parent is giving money without the other knowing, that could cause problems. The wife is upset about the $7, and the dad is upset about the $160. The dad's action of giving money without telling the wife might be seen as undermining her authority or creating a double standard. \n\nBut then again, the dad might think the wife is being too strict on the son for a small amount while she spends more on herself. The key issue here is lack of communication. The dad didn't discuss his actions with the wife, which could lead to misunderstandings or resentment. Even if he felt the need to balance the spending, the approach might be wrong because he didn't involve his wife in the decision.\n\nAlso, the parents agreed to let the son live at home, so maybe there was an understanding about financial support. If the dad is providing extra money without the wife's knowledge, it might disrupt their financial agreement. The wife might feel that her input is disregarded, leading to conflict. \n\nBut the dad's intention was to help the son use the money responsibly, which is a good thing. However, the method (without the wife's knowledge) is problematic. It's important in a marriage to be transparent about financial decisions, especially when it affects the household budget or the child's upbringing. \n\nSo even if the wife's reaction to the $7 seems harsh, the dad's solution was to act unilaterally, which is where he might be in the wrong. The correct approach would have been to talk to his wife and find a middle ground, rather than secretly giving money to the son.\n"
