When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for giving their son money without their wife's knowledge. The story is from Reddit's \"Am I the Asshole?\" subreddit, so the context is that the author wants to know if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The couple has a son in university who lives at home. They agree to let him stay there. The author mentions that their household isn't short on money, but there's a big disparity in how each family member is allowed to spend. The wife criticizes the son for spending $7 on a meal, but then the author notices she spent $160 on perfume. This seems like a fairness issue to the author. \n\nThe author's response is to start giving the son money secretly. The question is whether this action is wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants a second opinion.\n\nSo, considering the dynamics here. The parents had an agreement about the son living at home, and the wife's criticism of the $7 meal might be part of that agreement. The author then feels the wife is being unfair because she spent $160 on perfume. But by giving the son money without telling the wife, the author is undermining the wife's authority and possibly breaking the agreement they had. \n\nEven if the author thinks the wife is being unreasonable, the act of giving money secretly could be seen as deceitful. It's important to note that while the wife's reaction to the $7 meal might be excessive, the author's method of handling it\u2014by secretly supporting the son\u2014could lead to resentment and conflict in the marriage. Open communication is key in a relationship, and the author should have discussed the issue with the wife instead of taking unilateral action.\n\nAlso, the son is a mature adult, but the parents are still providing financial support. The author might be trying to balance the family's spending, but doing so without the wife's knowledge isn't the right approach. The wife has a right to be part of the financial decisions, especially when it involves their child's support. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they acted without transparency, which can erode trust and create more problems in the relationship. The correct approach would be to address the disparity in expectations openly with the wife rather than bypassing her.\n"
