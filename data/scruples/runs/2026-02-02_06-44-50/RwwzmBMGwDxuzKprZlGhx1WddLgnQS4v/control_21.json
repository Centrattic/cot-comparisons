When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple agreed to let their son stay at home during university. The dad gives the son money secretly, after a conflict where the mom scolded the son for a $7 meal, while she spent $160 on perfume. The dad is upset about the perceived inconsistency in how money is spent between their son and wife.\n\nSo, the key points here are about financial expectations and communication. The mom is critical of the son's spending, but the dad thinks she's being unfair compared to her own purchases. He then gives the son money without telling her, which is the main issue.\n\nThe dad's action of giving money without telling the wife could be seen as undermining their joint financial agreement. Even though they have enough money, the secrecy might indicate a lack of transparency in their household finances. The wife might feel disrespected or not involved in decisions about her son's expenses, especially since they had previously agreed on letting the son stay at home. \n\nAlso, the dad's response to the wife's criticism by giving the son money privately might be seen as taking sides in a financial disagreement without addressing the root issue. Instead of discussing their different views on spending, he's taking unilateral action, which could lead to more conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the dad might argue that he's trying to support his son's needs and correct what he sees as unfair treatment. The son is using the money responsibly, so maybe the dad's intention is good. However, the method\u2014doing it without his wife's knowledge\u2014is problematic because it bypasses their shared decision-making process.\n\nIn many relationships, financial matters are considered joint responsibilities. Not discussing significant decisions with your partner, even if you disagree, can lead to breaches of trust. The dad's action, while possibly well-intentioned, lacks transparency and could be seen as manipulative or disrespectful to his wife's role in their family's finances.\n\nTherefore, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't communicate with his wife about his actions, which is a key component of a healthy relationship. Even if he felt the wife was being unfair, addressing it through open dialogue would be more appropriate than acting unilaterally.\n"
