When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here.\n\nThe situation is about a dad giving his son money without the wife's knowledge. The parents agreed to let the son stay at home during university. The wife is upset when the son spends $7 on a meal, but the dad notices she spent $160 on perfume. The dad then gives money to the son secretly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider family dynamics. The parents are a team, right? So one parent giving money without the other's knowledge might be seen as undermining the partner. Even if the dad thinks the wife is being overly strict about the $7, he could have discussed it with her instead of bypassing her. That might be where the issue lies. \n\nThen there's the fairness aspect. The dad points out the wife spent more than the son, but maybe the wife is managing the household budget and has different priorities. If they have enough money overall, maybe the wife is trying to teach the son about financial responsibility. The dad's action of giving extra money could be seen as spoiling the son or not respecting the wife's role in managing finances.\n\nAlso, secrecy can be a problem in relationships. Even if the intention is good, acting without the spouse's knowledge can lead to mistrust. The dad might be trying to protect the son from what he sees as unfair criticism, but the method might be wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the wife is being unreasonable to criticize a small expense while spending much more herself. The dad's action could be a way to balance things out. But the key here is communication. If the parents had talked about their differing views on spending, maybe they could have found a compromise instead of one side acting behind the other's back.\n\nSo, the main issue is the lack of communication and the secrecy. The author's action is problematic because he's not involving his wife in the decision, which could have been a point of discussion. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not discussing the matter with her first.\n"
