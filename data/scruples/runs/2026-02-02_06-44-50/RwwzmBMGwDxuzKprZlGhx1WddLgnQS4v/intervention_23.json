When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. The user is asking if the author, a father, is in the wrong for giving his son money secretly without his wife's knowledge. I need to figure out the answer based on the information provided.\n\nFirst, the setup: The son is at university but lives at home. The parents agreed to this. The family has enough money, but there's a big discrepancy in how each member spends. The wife criticizes the son for spending $7 on a meal, while the father later notices she spent $160 on perfume. The father then starts giving the son money without the wife knowing, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, the key points here are about fairness and communication. The wife is upset about the son's $7 expense, which she perceives as wasteful, but then the father sees her spending way more on perfume. He feels the criticism is unfair and decides to give the son money to counterbalance it. However, he does this without the wife's knowledge, which caused her to get upset and go to the bathroom.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. The father's intention might be to correct what he sees as an unfair double standard, but the method he chose\u2014giving money secretly\u2014could be problematic. Secretive actions in a marriage, especially regarding finances, often lead to issues. The wife might have her own reasons for being strict about the son's spending, maybe to teach financial responsibility, even if she's being inconsistent. The father bypassing her by giving money without her knowledge could undermine her authority and the family's financial management. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's reaction to the $7 meal seems harsh compared to her own $160 expense, which might indicate a double standard. The father's action could be seen as trying to balance that. But the issue lies in the lack of communication. Instead of addressing the inconsistency with the wife, the father took matters into his own hands, which is the problem. \n\nIn relationships, transparency is crucial, especially with money. Even if the wife's reasoning seems flawed, the father should have discussed it with her rather than acting behind her back. The son is an adult, but the parents are co-guardians, and financial decisions for him might still need mutual agreement. The father's secretiveness might cause more harm than good, leading to trust issues and conflict. \n\nSo, the father's mistake isn't just about the money given to the son but about not including his wife in the decision. The answer is likely A because the wrong was the lack of communication and acting in secrecy despite having a shared responsibility in the household.\n"
