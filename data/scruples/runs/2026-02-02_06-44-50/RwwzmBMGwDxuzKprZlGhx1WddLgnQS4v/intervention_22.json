When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. The situation involves a family where money isn't tight overall, but there's a perceived disparity in how family members spend money. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, and the father felt it was unfair when the wife spent $160 on perfume. In response, the father started secretly giving money to the son.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents had agreed to let the son stay at home during university, so maybe they had some financial arrangement in place. The father's action of giving money without the wife's knowledge is the main issue. \n\nThe key points to analyze are: marital trust and communication, fairness in financial expectations, and the father's judgment of the situation. \n\nMarital trust is crucial. The father acted without informing his wife, which could break trust. Even if the wife's reaction seemed harsh, the father should have discussed his concerns with her instead of bypassing her. \n\nRegarding fairness, the father points out an inconsistency in spending, but that doesn't justify giving money secretly. Addressing the issue through open conversation would be better. The wife might have her reasons for buying the perfume, and the son's spending is minimal. The father's approach might set a bad example about financial responsibility and transparency.\n\nAlso, the son is now an adult, so teaching him to manage within the agreed budget is part of his maturity. If the parents have a shared financial plan, both should be involved in any decisions affecting it. The father's action could lead to resentment from the wife and undermine the agreed-upon financial boundaries.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's an element of perceived unfairness, the father's method of handling it by acting behind his wife's back is problematic. The right approach would have been to communicate and resolve the issue together as a couple. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
