When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this story is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. The story is about a family where money isn't an issue overall, but there's a perceived imbalance in how money is spent by family members.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let their son live at home during university. The father notices their son spending $7 on a meal, which the mother criticizes. The father defends the son and points out that the mother spent $160 on a perfume. The father then starts giving the son money secretly without the wife knowing, to help him without the mother's disapproval.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the father's decision to give money without the wife's knowledge. The mother is upset about the son's small expense, while the father thinks it's unfair compared to her spending. But the act of giving money without informing the spouse could be problematic. Marital trust is important, and keeping such a decision a secret might lead to bigger issues, even if the intent was good. The father might be trying to avoid conflict, but hiding it could breach trust.\n\nAnother angle is the parents' agreement on the son's living arrangements. If the mother agreed to the son staying at home, maybe she expected certain responsibilities or budgeting. The father's unilateral action might disrupt that agreement. Also, the wife's reaction to the $7 expense might be based on her own values or financial planning, which the father didn't consider. The father could have addressed the discrepancy by discussing it with the wife instead of acting alone.\n\nThe son is an adult, so the parents might have different views on how to support him. However, the method (secrecy) could be the problem here. Even well-intentioned actions without transparency can cause resentment. The wife might feel disrespected if the father made a financial decision without her input, especially since they are a household together. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the father points out the $7 vs. $160, but that's subjective. The mother might prioritize her spending differently. The father's response to the situation by giving money without her knowledge could be seen as undermining her authority or judgment. It's a classic case of differing priorities and communication issues. The father might think he's supporting his son, but the lack of communication with his wife is a key factor here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the father's action of secrecy is the main issue. Even if the intent was good, not involving the spouse in financial decisions, especially in a shared household, is likely to be the wrong move. Therefore, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
