When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent giving their son money without the spouse's knowledge.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The parents agreed to let their son stay at home during university. Money isn't an issue for the family, but there's a perceived imbalance. The wife criticizes the son for spending $7 on a meal, but the husband defends him after noticing she spent $160 on perfume. The husband then gives the son money secretly.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the husband's decision to give money without informing his wife. Even though the wife's reaction to the son seems harsh, the husband's approach might have been a way to address that imbalance. But is it right to act without his wife's knowledge? In a marriage, financial decisions are usually joint. By not discussing this with his wife, he might be undermining her and creating a secrecy problem. \n\nAlso, the husband's motivation is to counteract the wife's criticism. But instead of addressing the issue openly, he's handling it behind her back. That could lead to more conflict. The wife might feel disrespected if she finds out. Even if the husband thinks he's being fair, the method might be wrong because it's not transparent. \n\nOn the other hand, the son is using the money responsibly, and the husband is trying to support him. But the core issue is the lack of communication between the husband and wife. The husband should probably have talked to his wife about his concerns instead of acting alone. \n\nSo, while the wife's reaction to the son might be excessive, the husband's actions in not consulting her are problematic. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not being open with his wife about the financial support to their son.\n"
