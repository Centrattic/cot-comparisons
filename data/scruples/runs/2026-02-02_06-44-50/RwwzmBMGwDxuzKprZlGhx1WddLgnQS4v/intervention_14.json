When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. The situation involves a family where money isn't an issue overall, but there's a disparity in how each family member's spending is perceived.\n\nFirst, the wife criticizes the son for spending $7 on a meal, but then the husband points out that she spent $160 on perfume. This shows a double standard. The husband's reaction here is understandable, as he's highlighting the inconsistency. However, the key issue is the husband giving the son money without the wife knowing. \n\nThe husband's actions might be a way to support his son, especially since the son is in university and living at home. But giving money without the wife's knowledge could be seen as undermining her in the parenting role. The wife might feel that the husband is not being transparent or is not on the same page about financial expectations for their child. \n\nThe husband's intention is to help the son, but doing it secretly could lead to more conflict. Parents should ideally have a united front when it comes to financial lessons and boundaries. By not discussing this with his wife, the husband might be causing her to feel disrespected or excluded from a shared parenting decision. \n\nEven though the wife's criticism of the $7 meal seems harsh compared to her own $160 perfume purchase, the husband's solution of secretly funding his son isn't the healthiest approach. It's better to have an open conversation with the wife about their differing views on spending and agree on a strategy for supporting their son. \n\nSo, while the wife's behavior isn't perfect, the husband's decision to act without her knowledge is problematic. It's important in a marriage to communicate and collaborate on parenting decisions to avoid misunderstandings and maintain trust. Therefore, the husband is in the wrong here.\n"
