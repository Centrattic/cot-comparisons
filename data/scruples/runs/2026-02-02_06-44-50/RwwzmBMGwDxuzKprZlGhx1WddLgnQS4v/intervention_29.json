When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for giving their son money without their wife knowing. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe parents agreed to let their son stay at home during university. The family isn't poor, but there's a big difference in how each family member handles money. The wife scolded the son for spending $7 on a meal, but then the husband found out she spent $160 on perfume. He felt it was unfair and started giving the son money secretly. The question is whether the husband is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So the main points here are about fairness in spending, communication between spouses, and the secrecy of the husband's actions. The husband is upset because the wife is being critical of the son's spending while she spends more on herself. He thinks it's unfair and wants to support his son by giving him money without the wife's knowledge.\n\nBut giving money without the wife's knowledge could be a problem. Even if the husband feels the wife is being unreasonable, the key issue here is that he's acting behind her back. In a marriage, major financial decisions usually require mutual agreement, especially involving children. The wife might feel disrespected or undermined if the husband is making decisions without consulting her. Also, the husband's action could strain their relationship further because he's not addressing the issue openly but instead taking a secret approach.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is that the son uses the money responsibly, but the act of not informing the wife is what's problematic. It's about trust and transparency in the marriage. Even if the wife's reaction to the son's $7 meal seems excessive, the husband should address that with her directly rather than circumventing her by giving the son money without her knowledge. The secrecy might be more of an issue than the act of giving money itself.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband's main mistake is not communicating with his wife and instead acting behind her back. Even if his intention is to support his son and correct what he sees as unfair treatment, the method he used is inappropriate. The answer would likely be that he's in the wrong because of the lack of transparency and communication in their marriage.\n"
