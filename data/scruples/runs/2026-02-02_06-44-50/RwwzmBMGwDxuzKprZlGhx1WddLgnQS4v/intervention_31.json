When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person's son is at university but lives at home. The parents agreed to let him stay. The dad notices that the mom is upset with the son for spending $7 on a meal, while she spends $160 on perfume. The dad talks to the son and then starts giving him money without the wife's knowledge, saying the son uses it responsibly. The question is if the dad is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's consider the key points here. The main issue seems to be about financial fairness and transparency in the household. The dad is giving his son money secretly, which the mom wasn't aware of. The mom was reprimanding the son for a small expense, while she spent a lot on herself. The dad's intention is to balance that, he thinks the mom is being unfair.\n\nBut here's the thing: even if the dad thinks the mom is being unfair, giving money to the son without the wife's knowledge could be seen as undermining her authority. Also, financial decisions in a household are usually considered a joint matter. If they agreed to let the son stay at home, maybe there was an understanding about expenses. The dad might have a point about the inconsistency in spending, but the way he handled it\u2014secretly giving money\u2014might not be the best approach.\n\nAlso, the wife might feel that her concerns are being dismissed. If the dad had discussed the issue with her first, maybe they could have found a solution together. By bypassing her, he's not addressing the underlying issue of communication. The son might appreciate the support, but the parents' relationship could be harmed by this secrecy.\n\nSo, while the dad's intentions might be good, the action of giving money without telling his wife is likely where the problem lies. It's about respecting each other's roles and making joint decisions, especially regarding finances. Therefore, the dad is in the wrong for not communicating with his wife and acting unilaterally.\n"
