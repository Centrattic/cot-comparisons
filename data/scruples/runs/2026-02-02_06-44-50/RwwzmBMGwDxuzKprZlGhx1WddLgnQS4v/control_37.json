When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author did the right thing by giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. \n\nFirst, the situation: The parents agreed to let their son live at home during university. The family isn't in financial trouble, but there's a big difference in how each member spends money. The wife is upset when the son spends $7 on a meal but buys a $160 perfume herself. The father is upset by this inconsistency and starts giving the son money secretly.\n\nSo, the main issue is the father giving money without consulting the wife. The wife criticized the son for a small expense, while she spends much more on herself. The father feels this is unfair and decides to help the son by giving him money. But he does so without telling his wife. \n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are communication and respect for shared responsibilities. The husband and wife should be on the same page about financial decisions, especially when it involves their child. By not discussing this with his wife, the father is undermining their agreement and possibly creating a rift between them. Even if the wife's actions seem inconsistent, the right approach would be to address the issue with her rather than taking matters into his own hands. Secretly giving money to the son might cause more problems, like the wife feeling disrespected or the child getting mixed messages about financial responsibility.\n\nAlso, the father's justification is that the son uses the money wisely, but the method of giving without the wife's knowledge is problematic. It's about transparency in a marriage. So, even if the intention is good, the action of not involving his wife is what's in question here. Therefore, the father is in the wrong for not communicating with his wife about this.\n"
