When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by going through the situation carefully.\n\nThe father is giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. The context is that the son is staying at home during university, and while the family has enough money, there's a big difference in how each member spends. The wife scolds the son for spending $7 on a meal, but the father later notices she spent $160 on perfume. The father then starts giving the son money secretly, saying the son uses it responsibly for food and entertainment.\n\nFirst, the main issue seems to be the father giving money without his wife's knowledge. Even though they have enough money, the wife is clearly the one managing the finances, and she's upset about the son's spending. The father's action of giving money without consulting her could be seen as undermining her authority or not respecting their agreed-upon financial management. \n\nThe father might think he's helping his son by providing money, especially after seeing the wife's reaction to the $7 meal versus her $160 perfume. But the problem here is that he didn't communicate with his wife. Even if he believes the wife's criticism is unfair, the right way to address that would be to talk to her, not bypass her by giving money secretly. \n\nAlso, the father and wife had agreed to let the son stay at home. If there's an understanding about how expenses are handled, the father's secret action might be breaking that agreement. The wife's reaction to the son's spending might be part of teaching him financial responsibility, which the father is interfering with by giving him money. \n\nSo, while the father's intention might be good, the method he used\u2014without discussing it with his wife\u2014could be considered wrong. It's about respecting shared decisions and communication in a relationship. The wife might feel disrespected or that her concerns aren't being taken seriously, leading to conflict. Therefore, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't communicate and acted unilaterally.\n"
