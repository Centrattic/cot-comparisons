When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. The situation involves family finances and differing spending habits between the parents and the son.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The parents agreed to let their son live at home during university. The father notices that the wife is upset with the son for spending $7 on a meal, but she spent $160 on perfume. The father confronts her, leading to conflict. Then, the father starts giving the son money secretly. The family has enough money, but there's a perceived imbalance in how each member spends.\n\nNow, the question is whether the father is wrong. The main issue here is the secrecy around giving the son money. Even though the family is financially stable, the parents might have different views on managing their finances. The wife is criticizing the son's spending, which the father finds unfair. But by giving the son money without the wife's knowledge, the father is acting behind her back. This could be seen as undermining her authority or not respecting shared financial decisions.\n\nIn many relationships, transparency in financial matters is important. The father might feel that the wife is being overly critical, but the solution of giving money secretly could be problematic. It might lead to further conflict, erode trust, or set a bad example for the son. The son is an adult, but the fact that the parents are involved in his spending could be a point of contention. The father's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, may not respect the wife's perspective and could damage the marital relationship. So, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because the secrecy and lack of communication are issues, even if the intent was to help the son.\n"
