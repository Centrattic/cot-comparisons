When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the dad gave his son money without the wife's knowledge. The parents agreed to let the son stay at home during university. The wife is upset the son spent $7 on a meal, but the dad notices she bought a $160 perfume and confronts her. Then he starts giving the son money secretly.\n\nFirst, the parents are a team, right? So if they made an agreement about the son living at home, maybe they should have discussed financial expectations beforehand. The wife is upset about the $7, which seems minor, but the dad points out her $160 perfume as being more expensive. That could be a fairness issue, but maybe the wife has her reasons for buying the perfume. However, the dad's response is to bypass her by giving the son money without her knowing. That seems like a problem because they should be on the same page about managing finances, especially when it comes to their child. Even though they have enough money, the dad's secret action undermines the wife's role and could cause more conflict. So maybe he's in the wrong because he didn't communicate and went behind her back. Also, the wife's reaction might be about setting boundaries for the son, and the dad's intervention might not be respecting that. So answer A.\n"
