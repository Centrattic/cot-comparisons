When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. \n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let their son live with them while he's in university. The husband gives the son money secretly because he notices the wife is strict about the son's spending, like being upset over $7 on a meal, while she spends $160 on perfume. The husband thinks it's unfair and wants to help the son.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the husband did wrong by giving money without telling his wife. Let's break it down. \n\nIn a household where finances are usually shared, giving money to a child without the spouse's knowledge could be seen as undermining their agreement. But the wife's behavior might have justified the husband's actions. She criticized the son for a small expense but spent much more on herself. The husband felt the need to balance things, so he stepped in. \n\nHowever, withholding this from his wife could cause trust issues. Partners usually need to be on the same page about their finances and how they support their children. The husband might have had good intentions, but not discussing it with his wife could lead to bigger problems. \n\nThe wife's reaction to the perfume price might indicate different spending priorities, but that doesn't mean the husband's approach is right. The key point is whether he should have communicated with his wife first. Even if he disagreed with her, the secret giving could be seen as deceitful, which is a problem in a marriage. \n\nOn the other hand, if the husband truly believed his wife was being unfair and the son needed support, his action might be understandable. But the method of doing it without her knowledge complicates things. \n\nSo, the answer likely hinges on whether the husband's actions violated their household's financial agreement. Since they both agreed to let the son stay, but the husband took it further by secretly providing funds, that might be considered wrong because it bypasses the wife's input and could disrupt their financial dynamics. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't communicate with his wife and acted unilaterally, which could damage trust and partnership.\n"
