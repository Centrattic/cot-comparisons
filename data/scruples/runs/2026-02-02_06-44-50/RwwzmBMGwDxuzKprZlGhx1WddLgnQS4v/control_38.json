When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. The situation is that they agreed to let their son stay at home during university. The father notices the wife is critical of the son spending $7 on a meal, but then she spends $160 on perfume, which upsets him. So he starts giving the son money secretly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents are in agreement about the son living at home, but there's a disagreement about how they handle money. The wife is being strict about the son's spending while she spends more on herself. The father is trying to balance this by giving money to the son without the wife knowing. \n\nNow, the question is whether the father is in the wrong. The wife is within her rights to be concerned about the son's spending since they're providing him a home, and it's common for parents to want to manage expenses. However, the father's approach of giving money without her knowledge might be problematic. \n\nOne point is that the father didn't discuss this with his wife, which could lead to trust issues. If they had a shared understanding about the son's financial support, this action might break that. Also, the wife's criticism of the son's $7 meal versus her own $160 perfume could be seen as inconsistent, but the father's secret giving might be a way to correct that, but the method is questionable.\n\nThe son is a mature adult, so maybe he should be taught to manage money, but the parents might have different approaches. The father's actions could be seen as trying to support the son, but without transparency, it's a problem. In most cases, couples should be open about financial decisions, especially when involving their children. \n\nSo while the father's intention might be to show fairness, acting without the wife's knowledge is likely the wrong approach. The answer is probably A, but I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing. Maybe the wife's reaction was over the top, but the father's method of handling it without communication is the issue. Yeah, I think A is correct.\n"
