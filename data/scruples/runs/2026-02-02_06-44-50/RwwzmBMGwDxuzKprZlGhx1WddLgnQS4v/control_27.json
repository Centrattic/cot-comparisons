When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the family situation: the couple agreed to let their son live at home while he's in university. Money isn't a problem overall, but there's a big difference in how each family member's money is managed. The wife criticizes the son for spending $7 on a meal, but then the husband notices she spent $160 on perfume. He's upset about the double standard and starts giving the son money secretly. The wife got upset when confronted about the $7 vs. $160. The husband's action is to give money without her knowledge, which is the main point here.\n\nThe key factors here are double standards in spending, communication within the marriage, and financial transparency. The wife seems to be more strict about the son's spending, while the husband is trying to balance things by giving him money. But the issue is that the husband didn't discuss this with his wife. Even if there's a perceived unfairness, giving money behind her back could be seen as undermining their agreement or her authority. \n\nMarriages typically require transparency when it comes to finances, especially if they manage money jointly. The husband's action might be well-intentioned, but not discussing it with his wife could lead to mistrust. The wife's reaction to the $7 meal might be a red flag, indicating possible control issues, but the husband's solution of secretly funding the son isn't without fault. Open communication would be better. He should have addressed the double standard with her first and maybe come to a mutual agreement on how to handle the son's expenses.\n\nSo, even though the wife's behavior seems harsh, the husband's approach of bypassing her without discussion is problematic. The answer is probably A, but I need to make sure there are no mitigating factors. The son is mature, but the main issue is the couple's relationship and financial decisions. Secretly giving money can lead to more conflict. So yes, the author is in the wrong for not involving his wife in the financial decisions and for acting without her knowledge.\n"
