When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author (the father) is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge.\n\nFirst, the context: The couple agreed their son would live at home during university. They have enough money, but there's a big disparity in how each family member spends. The wife criticized the son for a $7 meal, while she spent $160 on perfume. The father thought that wasn't fair, so he started secretly giving the son money to help him out, since the son uses it responsibly.\n\nNow, considering the father's actions. The key points here are about the couple's communication and shared financial responsibilities. The wife and husband are a team when it comes to managing their finances and their son's upbringing. By giving money without the wife's knowledge, the father might be undermining their partnership. Even if the wife's reaction to the $7 meal seems excessive, the father's response of secretly supporting the son could be seen as taking matters into his own hands without discussing the issue with his wife first.\n\nThe wife's $160 perfume purchase versus the son's $7 meal is a red flag. The father is right to point out the inconsistency, but the way he addressed it matters. Instead of confronting the wife and discussing the financial priorities as a couple, he chose to bypass her. This could lead to more conflict and a lack of trust in their relationship. Financial decisions, especially concerning their children, should ideally be mutual. The father's action might be well-intentioned, but not involving the wife was a misstep. So, the answer is A; the father is in the wrong because he didn't communicate with his wife about the financial issue and instead acted unilaterally.\n"
