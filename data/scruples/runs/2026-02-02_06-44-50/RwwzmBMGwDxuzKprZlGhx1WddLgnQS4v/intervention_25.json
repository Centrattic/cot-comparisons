When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. \n\nFirst, the context: The couple agreed to let their son live at home during university. Money isn't an issue for the household, but there's a big disparity in how each family member spends. The wife is upset with the son for spending $7, while she spends $160 on perfume. The father confronts the wife, and then starts giving the son money secretly.\n\nThe key points here are the lack of communication and the secretiveness. The father didn't discuss this with his wife, which could lead to resentment or conflict. Even though the father's intention is to support the son, doing it without the wife's knowledge undermines their agreed-upon household finances. It's possible that the wife has a different view on spending and financial responsibility, and the father's action could be seen as taking sides without addressing the root issue. \n\nAlso, the father's initial reaction to the wife's criticism might have contributed to the situation. Instead of resolving the disagreement about spending habits, he took action unilaterally. That could be seen as a breach of trust in the marriage. \n\nSo, even if the father's intent was good, the method\u2014acting without the wife's knowledge\u2014is problematic. The right approach might have been to have an open discussion with the wife about their differing views on spending and find a solution together, rather than secretly giving the son money. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
