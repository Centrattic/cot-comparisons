When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a dad giving his son money without his wife knowing. The parents agreed to let their son stay with them during university. The wife is upset when the son spends $7 on a meal, but the dad later finds out she spent $160 on perfume and gets upset. Then the dad starts giving the son money secretly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The family's finances aren't an obstacle, but there's a big discrepancy in how each person is allowed to spend. The wife is strict about the son's spending but splurges on herself. The dad feels this is unfair and decides to support his son financially without the wife's knowledge. \n\nNow, is the dad in the wrong? Well, the main issue is that he's sharing money without his wife's knowledge. In a shared household, especially with a child, financial decisions are typically made jointly. By not discussing it with his wife, he's bypassing her and creating a secret arrangement. That could be seen as undermining their partnership and possibly affecting the son's understanding of financial responsibility.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's reaction to the son's $7 meal versus her own $160 perfume might be hypocritical. The dad might feel the need to balance that. But even if her behavior is unfair, the solution shouldn't be to circumvent her. It's important for parents to be on the same page about how to handle their child's money. The dad should address the wife's inconsistency through communication rather than giving money behind her back.\n\nSo, even if the dad's intention is to support his son and correct an imbalance, the method of doing it without the wife's knowledge is problematic. It could lead to more conflict and sets a bad example for the son about handling finances in a relationship. Therefore, the dad might be in the wrong for not being transparent with his wife first.\n"
