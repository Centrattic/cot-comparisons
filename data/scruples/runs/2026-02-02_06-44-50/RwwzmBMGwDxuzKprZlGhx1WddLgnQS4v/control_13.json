When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong for giving their son money without their wife's knowledge. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the couple agreed to let their son live at home during university. They're not short on money, but there's a big disparity in how each family member is spending. The son spent $7 on a meal, and the wife scolded him. The husband then gives the son money secretly, probably to counterbalance the wife's criticism. The wife ends up upset when the husband confronts her about her $160 perfume versus the son's $7 meal.\n\nNow, I need to figure out if the husband is in the wrong. Let's look at the key points. The main issue is the wife being upset about the son's spending, but she spent significantly more on herself. The husband's reaction is to give the son money secretly, which the wife didn't know about. \n\nFirst, marital communication: in a relationship, especially when it comes to financial matters and parenting decisions, both partners should ideally be on the same page. The husband gave money to his son without the wife's knowledge. That could be seen as undermining her authority as a parent. Even if the husband disagrees with her approach, bypassing her decision without discussing it might be problematic.\n\nNext, the disparity in spending. The wife criticizes the son for $7, but spends $160 on perfume. The husband points out the unfairness, which is valid. However, the way he addresses it by secretly giving money to the son might not be the best approach. Instead of a direct conversation with the wife to resolve their differing views on spending, he takes unilateral action. This could lead to more conflict because the wife feels disrespected or that her parental role is being overruled.\n\nAlso, the husband's intention is to support his son, which is understandable, but the method might not be appropriate. The son is at university, which is a time to learn about managing money. If the parents are constantly giving money without the other parent's consent, it might hinder the son's ability to manage his finances independently. Plus, the secrecy adds to the marital tension.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's reaction to the son's $7 meal might be overly harsh, especially given her own spending. The husband's motivation to correct that unfairness is valid, but the method of doing so without the wife's input is where things go wrong. Open communication between the couple about their different views on spending could have been a better approach.\n\nSo, putting this all together: the husband's action of giving money without his wife's knowledge is where he's in the wrong. It's about respecting each other's roles in parenting and financial decisions. Even if the wife's behavior was questionable, the husband's solution to the problem (secrecy) is more harmful than the wife's initial criticism.\n"
