When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the scenario again.\n\nThe user is a parent who's given their son money without the wife's knowledge. The context is that they agreed to let their son live at home during university. The wife is upset about the son spending $7 on a meal, while the father later spends $160 on perfume. The father thinks this is unfair and decides to give the son money secretly to balance it out, even though the wife is upset. The question is whether the father is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about family finances and communication. The father and wife have a household with enough money, but there's a disparity in how each family member spends. The father feels the wife is being overly critical of the son's small expense compared to her own larger purchase. He then gives the son money without the wife's consent, which the wife might not be aware of.\n\nSo, the main ethical issue here is the lack of communication. The father didn't discuss this with the wife, even though they're a couple managing the household together. Even if the wife's reaction to the son's $7 meal seems disproportionate, the father's solution is to act unilaterally. That might not be the best approach. Couples are supposed to agree on financial matters, especially when it involves their children. By not discussing it with the wife, the father might be undermining their partnership and the agreed-upon financial boundaries.\n\nAnother angle is the fairness aspect. The father points out the wife's spending as being inconsiderate, but the wife might have her reasons for buying the perfume. The father's response is to give the son money, which could lead to other financial issues if the wife finds out. It's possible that the wife is managing the household budget and has different priorities. Without open dialogue, the father's action could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nAlso, the son is living at home, so the parents might have an understanding about expenses. If the wife is handling the finances and the father bypasses her to give money to the son, that could create tension. The father might be trying to be fair, but the method of doing it without involving the wife is problematic.\n\nIn many relationships, financial decisions, especially those involving children, should be mutual. The father's decision to act alone might be inconsiderate, even if his intentions are good. The wife's criticism of the son's spending might not be about the amount but about setting boundaries or budgeting. The father could have addressed the issue by talking to the wife first, explaining his perspective, and finding a solution together.\n\nSo, considering all this, the father's action of giving money without the wife's knowledge is likely in the wrong because it's a breach of communication and mutual agreement in the household. The right approach would have been to discuss the financial concerns with his wife and reach a mutual understanding before taking any action.\n"
