When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The parents agreed to let their son live at home while he's in university. The husband notices a discrepancy in how money is spent. The son spent $7 on a meal, and the wife criticized him. The husband then finds out the wife spent $160 on perfume, which he finds unfair. Because of this, he starts giving the son money without the wife knowing, saying the son uses it responsibly.\n\nSo, the main points are: giving a child money without the spouse's knowledge, and perceived unfairness in spending between the child and the wife. The husband's action is driven by perceiving inequity in how the family's money is treated. But is he in the wrong?\n\nIn many cultures, parents usually have shared financial responsibilities, especially when supporting a child through university. If the husband is giving money to the son without the wife's knowledge, that could be seen as undermining their agreement or financial partnership. The wife might feel that her decisions about the child's spending are being contradicted. Also, if the couple is supposed to be a team, making a decision that affects the family's finances without consulting the spouse could be problematic. \n\nHowever, the husband's intention might be to correct what he sees as an imbalance. The wife criticized the son for $7 but spent $160 on herself, which the husband finds unfair. So he's trying to even things out by giving the son more money. But even if the intention is good, the method of doing it without the wife's knowledge might be the issue. It's about communication and mutual agreement in a relationship.\n\nSo, the husband's action is about the principle of transparency. Even if the wife's behavior was unreasonable, the husband's response should have been to discuss this with her rather than act unilaterally. By giving the son money without her knowledge, he might be creating a situation where the wife feels disrespected or that her authority is undermined. In a marriage, major decisions about finances, especially those involving children, typically require mutual consent. \n\nTherefore, while the husband might have valid concerns about the spending disparity, the method of addressing it by secretly giving his son money is likely where he's in the wrong. The right approach would have been to discuss the issue with his wife first. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
