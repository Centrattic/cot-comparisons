When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. The story is about a family where they agreed to let their son live at home during university. The wife criticizes the son for spending $7 on a meal, but the author notices she spent $160 on perfume. He gives the son money secretly because he feels it's unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents are in agreement about the son staying home, so that's a given. The wife is being strict about the son's spending, but the author sees her own $160 expense and feels it's a double standard. He gives the son money to help him out, not for anything harmful, just as a mature adult would use it. \n\nBut wait, the main issue is whether giving money without the wife's knowledge is wrong. In a marriage, financial decisions are usually shared, especially when it involves their child. Even if they have enough money, the wife might have her own reasons for being frugal with the son. The author's action could undermine the wife's authority and disrupt their agreed-upon parenting approach. \n\nThe wife might be managing the household budget or setting boundaries for the son's financial education. If the author's secret financial support contradicts that, it could create inconsistency. The son might get confused about the rules if one parent is lenient and the other is strict. Also, the wife's $160 perfume purchase could be a personal choice, while the $7 meal is about the son's needs. The author's reaction might stem from a misunderstanding of the wife's priorities. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, he's trying to be fair by pointing out the discrepancy. But the method of giving money without informing the wife isn't ideal. It's important in a marriage to communicate about such matters, even if you disagree. The author could have discussed his concerns with the wife instead of bypassing her. So, while his intentions are good, the action of not involving the wife might be the issue. The answer is likely A, yes, he's in the wrong because he didn't communicate with his wife, leading to potential conflict and undermining her authority.\n"
