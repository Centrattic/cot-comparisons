When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the dad gave his son money without the wife's knowledge. The wife and son have different spending habits that the dad finds unfair. The dad gave his son money secretly to balance it out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The family's finances aren't an issue overall, but there's a disparity in how each person spends. The wife criticizes the son for a $7 meal but spends $160 on perfume. The dad thinks this is unfair and decides to give the son money without telling the wife. \n\nNow, the question is whether the dad is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The main issues here are communication and transparency in a marriage, parenting decisions, and financial management.\n\nIn a marriage, especially when it comes to finances, open communication is key. The dad didn't discuss this with his wife, which could be a problem. Even if the wife's reaction seemed harsh, the dad's solution was to act behind her back. That could lead to trust issues. Giving money to the son without the wife's knowledge might undermine their joint parenting agreement and financial decisions. \n\nAlso, the dad's approach might not address the underlying issue. The wife's criticism of the son's spending might be about teaching financial responsibility, while the dad is trying to give the son more freedom. Without discussing these differing views, the dad's actions could create more conflict. \n\nBut then again, the dad is trying to support his son's independence and balance what he sees as unfair treatment. The son is in university, so learning to manage money is important. However, the dad's method of giving money secretly might not be the best approach. It's possible that the wife and dad should have a conversation about their values regarding finances and how to best support their son.\n\nAnother angle: the husband didn't address the wife's behavior directly. Instead of confronting her about her inconsistency, he took matters into his own hands. That could be seen as avoiding the real issue. A healthier approach might be to talk through their disagreements about spending and parenting styles.\n\nSo, the dad's main mistake was not communicating with his wife. Even if he thought her reaction was unfair, giving money in secret could damage their relationship. The right thing would be to discuss the situation together to find a solution that both agree on.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because of the lack of communication and transparency in a marriage, which is crucial in such matters.\n"
