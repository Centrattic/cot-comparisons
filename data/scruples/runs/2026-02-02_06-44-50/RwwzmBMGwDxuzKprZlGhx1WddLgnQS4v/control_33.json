When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let their son stay at home while he goes to university. The family has enough money, but there's a big difference in how each family member's money is managed. The son spends $7 on a meal and gets scolded by the wife. Then the husband notices she spent $160 on perfume and questions her about the fairness. After that, the husband starts giving the son money secretly.\n\nSo the main issue here is the husband acting without the wife's knowledge. They're a couple, and financial decisions usually require mutual agreement, even if they have enough money. The wife is upset about the son's spending, and the husband is reacting by giving the son money, which might be seen as undermining the wife's authority or their joint parenting approach. \n\nEven though the husband might think he's being fair by balancing the spending, not discussing it with his wife first could lead to trust issues. The wife might feel that her concerns about the son's spending are being dismissed, and the husband is making unilateral decisions. Money matters in a marriage often need transparency and teamwork. The husband's action, while possibly well-intentioned, could be seen as not respecting their shared responsibility in managing their finances and parenting.\n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because he didn't communicate with his wife before giving the son money, which is a joint decision in a marriage. The answer should be A.\n"
