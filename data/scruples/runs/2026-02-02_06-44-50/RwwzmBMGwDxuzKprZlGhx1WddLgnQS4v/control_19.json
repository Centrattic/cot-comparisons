When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The couple agreed to let their son stay at home during university. Money isn't a problem, but there's a perceived imbalance in how each family member spends. The wife criticizes the son for a $7 meal, but the husband gives her a $160 perfume. The husband then starts giving the son money secretly because he thinks the wife is being unfair.\n\nSo the core issue here is about fairness and communication in financial matters within the family. The husband feels his wife is being inconsistent in her spending judgments. However, the key point is that he bypassed his wife by giving the son money without her knowledge. \n\nEven if the husband believes the wife's criticism is unfair, the act of not discussing this with her and instead making a unilateral decision could be seen as undermining their partnership. Financial decisions, especially those affecting shared resources or family members, should ideally be made together. By acting without her knowledge, the husband might be violating the trust and agreed-upon financial boundaries, even if his intention was to support his son.\n\nAdditionally, the wife's reaction to the $7 meal versus her own $160 purchase might indicate different priorities, but the husband's response (intervening and then secretly funding the son) doesn't address the underlying issue of communication. It's possible that the husband should have discussed his concerns with his wife first, rather than taking matters into his own hands. \n\nSo, while the husband's motivation might be good, the method he used\u2014acting without his wife's knowledge\u2014is problematic. It's about the lack of transparency and respect for their shared financial decisions. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong)."
