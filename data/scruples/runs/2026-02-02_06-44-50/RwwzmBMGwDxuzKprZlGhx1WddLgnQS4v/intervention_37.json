When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving their son money without their wife's knowledge. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let the son live at home during university. The author mentions that money isn't an obstacle in the household, but there's a big disproportion in how each family member spends. The wife scolded the son for a $7 meal, but the author found out she spent $160 on perfume. The author then started giving the son money secretly, which the wife isn't aware of.\n\nThe main issue here is the lack of communication. The author is bypassing their wife's input. Even though the wife's reaction to the son's spending seems excessive compared to her own spending, the author's solution was to act unilaterally without discussing it with their wife. That could lead to more conflict and mistrust. \n\nFinancial decisions in a household, especially involving children, usually require mutual agreement between partners. By not discussing this with his wife, the author is undermining her role and potentially creating a rift in their relationship. Even if the wife's reaction was harsh, the proper approach would be to address the spending habits together, not to secretly provide funds. \n\nAdditionally, the son might not need the extra money if the parents are already covering his living costs. The author's action could be seen as enabling the son without considering their wife's perspective. \n\nSo, even though the wife's behavior is questionable, the author's decision to act without her knowledge is a breach of trust and proper communication. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
