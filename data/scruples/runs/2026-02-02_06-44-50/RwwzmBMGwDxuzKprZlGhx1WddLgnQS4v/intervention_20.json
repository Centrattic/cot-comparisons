When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving their son money without the spouse's knowledge. The story is about a family where the parents agreed to let their son live at home during university. The husband notices his wife is being critical of the son spending $7 on a meal, while she spends $160 on perfume, and then the husband starts giving the son money in secret.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main issue here. The key point is about the husband providing money to their son without informing the wife. In a marriage, finances are typically a shared responsibility, even if they have enough money. The wife might have her own opinions on how to manage the family budget and allocate funds. The husband's action of giving money in secret could be seen as undermining the wife's authority or not including her in financial decisions regarding their child, which might be a point of contention.\n\nThe wife was upset about the son's $7 meal, which the husband found concerning because she spent $160 on perfume. This suggests there's a discrepancy in how each parent views appropriate spending, but the husband's response was to discreetly give the son money instead of addressing it with the wife. By not discussing this with his wife, he's essentially taking sides and making a unilateral decision that might have financial implications they hadn't planned together. That's a problem because it could lead to conflicts or a lack of trust between the spouses.\n\nEven though the family isn't in financial trouble, the principle of transparency in a marriage is important. The husband might think he's helping his son by giving him money, but withholding this from his wife could be seen as deceitful. The wife's reaction to the son's spending could be based on her own priorities or concerns, which the husband might not fully understand. Instead of secretly giving the son money, a more constructive approach would be to have a conversation with the wife about their differing views on spending and perhaps find a compromise that respects both their perspectives.\n\nSo, the husband's action of giving money without the wife's knowledge is likely the issue here. It's a breach of trust and not a collaborative approach to parenting and financial management. Therefore, the answer would be A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
