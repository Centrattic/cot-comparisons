When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person (the author) is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a parent who gave their son money without the wife's knowledge. The context is that the son is in university nearby and lives at home. Money isn't an issue for the family, but there's a disparity in how each family member's spending is handled. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, but then the author found out she spent $160 on perfume. The author then started giving the son money secretly because he felt the wife was being unfair.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the secrecy involved in giving the son money and the perceived unfairness in the wife's spending. The author's reasoning is that the wife is being inconsistent by being upset about the son's small expense but buying something expensive for herself. The author wants to support the son and sees it as a way to even things out. However, the main issue here is that the author did this without the wife's knowledge, which might be a breach of trust or communication.\n\nNow, in terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, the author is trying to be fair and supportive to their son. On the other hand, they didn't communicate this with their spouse, which could lead to bigger issues. Financial decisions, especially when involving family members, should ideally be discussed between partners to maintain trust and transparency. The wife might feel that her partner is undermining her parenting authority or not respecting her spending choices. Even if the wife's criticism of the $7 meal seems harsh, the author's solution of secret financial support might not address the root of the problem and could create more conflict.\n\nAlso, the author's actions could be seen as taking sides in a family matter without addressing the communication issues. Instead of giving money secretly, it might have been better to discuss with the wife about her reaction to the son's spending and why she's doing that. The author's decision to bypass the wife might be seen as the wrong approach because it lacks transparency and could harm the marital relationship.\n\nSo, even though the author's intention might be good, the method of acting without the spouse's knowledge is problematic. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here because they didn't communicate their actions with their partner, which is important in a marriage, especially regarding financial matters.\n"
