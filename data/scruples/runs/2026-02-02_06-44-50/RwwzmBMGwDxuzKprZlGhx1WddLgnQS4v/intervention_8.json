When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for giving their son money without their wife's knowledge. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation: The family has enough money, but there's a perceived discrepancy in how different family members are treated when it comes to spending. The son spent $7 on a meal, and the wife criticized him. The father, after finding out the wife spent $160 on perfume, gave the son money secretly. The key points here are the lack of communication between the parents and the father's decision to act without consulting his wife.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the father's action of giving money without the wife's knowledge is problematic. Even though the wife's reaction to the son's $7 meal seems disproportionate compared to her own $160 expense, the father's response was to bypass the wife entirely. Open communication is essential in a marriage, especially when making decisions that affect the family's finances. By not discussing this with his wife, the father is being dishonest and undermining their partnership. The wife has a right to know about such decisions because it involves family resources and could affect their financial planning or joint decisions.\n\nAdditionally, the father could have addressed the spending issue with his wife first. Instead of secretly giving the son money, he might have discussed the discrepancy and agreed on a fair approach. The son is an adult, so maybe there's a way to teach him about budgeting or financial responsibility without the father stepping in secretly. The father's action might also set a bad example about honesty and transparency in the relationship.\n\nHowever, the wife's behavior is also questionable. Reacting harshly to a $7 expense while spending $160 on herself isn't fair. But that doesn't justify the father's lack of communication. The mistake here is on the father's side because he chose to act unilaterally without addressing the issue with his wife. The correct approach would have been to talk to her, express his concerns about the spending discrepancy, and come to an agreement together on how to handle the situation, possibly adjusting the budget or setting different financial boundaries for the son.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the father is in the wrong because he didn't communicate openly with his wife, leading to a breach of trust and a lack of joint decision-making in their shared finances.\n"
