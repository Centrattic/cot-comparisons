When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a father giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the family agreed to let their son stay at home while he's in university. The parents have enough money, but there's a big disparity in how each family member uses their money. The son spent $7 on a meal, and the wife was upset. Then the father found out the wife spent $160 on a perfume and called her out. In response, the father started giving the son money secretly.\n\nThe key points here are the double standard and the secrecy. The father is upset because the wife is reprimanding the son for a small expense while she spends a much larger amount. However, his solution is to give the son money without the wife's knowledge, which could be seen as undermining her. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Even if there's a perceived inequality in spending, the father didn't address it with his wife directly. Instead, he took matters into his own hands by secretly funding the son. This could cause more tension because the wife might feel disrespected or that her concerns are being ignored. The father might think he's helping the son, but by not being transparent, he's creating a breach of trust.\n\nAlso, the wife's reaction to the son's $7 meal might seem harsh to some, but it's possible she has her reasons, like teaching budgeting or being concerned about the son's future financial habits. The father's response of giving the son money could be enabling the son to continue spending without learning responsibility. However, the father mentions the son is mature and uses the money wisely, which complicates things.\n\nThe main issue here is the lack of communication. The father should have discussed the double standard with his wife instead of acting alone. By giving the son money secretly, he's not only disrespecting his wife's role in co-parenting but also potentially creating a conflict that could have been resolved through dialogue. So, the author is in the wrong because he didn't communicate and instead acted behind his wife's back.\n"
