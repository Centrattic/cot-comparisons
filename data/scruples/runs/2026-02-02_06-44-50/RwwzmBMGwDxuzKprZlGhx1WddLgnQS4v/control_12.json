When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let their son live at home during university. The family isn't poor, but there's a big disparity in how each family member's money is managed. The son spent $7 on a meal, and the wife criticized him. The author then secretly gave the son money without telling the wife. The wife later spent $160 on perfume, which the author points out as hypocritical. The author's action is giving money to the son in secret.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the secrecy. The author didn't discuss this with their wife, which could be a problem in the relationship. Even though the wife's reaction to the son's spending seems over the top (since $7 vs. $160 is a big difference), the author's solution was to bypass the wife and give the son money. That could be seen as undermining the wife's authority or not being transparent in the relationship. In a marriage, financial decisions usually require mutual agreement, especially if they share a household. By not involving the wife, the author might be seen as contributing to the problem rather than addressing the communication issue. The author could have talked to the wife about their different spending habits instead of secretly giving money to the son. So, the wrong here is the secrecy and lack of communication, not necessarily the act of giving money itself. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't handle the situation with transparency.\n"
