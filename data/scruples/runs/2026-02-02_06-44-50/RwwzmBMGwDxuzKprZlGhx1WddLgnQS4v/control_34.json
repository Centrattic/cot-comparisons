When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the dad gave his son money without his wife knowing. The wife was upset with the son for spending $7 on a meal, but then the dad finds out she spent $160 on perfume. The dad then gives the son money secretly.\n\nFirst, the money isn't a problem in the household, but there's a big disparity in how each family member's spending is viewed. The wife criticizes the son for a small expense, but she spends a lot more on herself. The dad feels that's unfair and decides to support the son by giving him money.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about the fairness of the parents' approach to money. The dad thinks his wife is being hypocritical, so he takes matters into his own hands. But by giving the son money without the wife's knowledge, he's undermining their agreed-upon parenting strategy. Even if the wife's reaction seems disproportionate, the dad's solution is to bypass her, which could cause more conflict. \n\nIn a marriage, financial decisions should ideally be made together, especially when it involves their child. The dad's action might be seen as a way to side with the son against the wife, which isn't healthy for the family dynamic. Even if the wife's criticism was harsh, the appropriate step would be to discuss it with her and find a mutual agreement on how to handle the son's expenses. Secretly giving money could lead to resentment and broken trust between the couple.\n\nTherefore, the dad is in the wrong because he didn't communicate with his wife and made a decision that affects their shared responsibilities as parents. Even though the wife's behavior might be questionable, the solution shouldn't be to act without her knowledge.\n"
