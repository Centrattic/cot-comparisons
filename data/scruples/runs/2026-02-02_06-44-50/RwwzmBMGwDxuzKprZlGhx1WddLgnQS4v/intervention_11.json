When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for giving their son money without their wife's knowledge. The user thinks they are in the wrong, but wants to know the community's opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parents agreed to let their son live at home while he goes to university nearby. They don't have financial issues as a household, but there's a big difference in how each family member spends money. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, then later the husband found out she spent $160 on perfume. He confronted her, and then started giving the son money secretly, without his wife's knowledge. The son uses it responsibly.\n\nSo the main points here are: the husband bypassed his wife by giving their son money without her knowing. The wife's reaction to the son's spending seems inconsistent compared to her own spending. The husband is trying to balance what he perceives as unfair treatment from his wife towards the son.\n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. From a relationship standpoint, giving money to a child without the other parent's knowledge could be seen as undermining the wife. Even if the husband's intention is to correct an imbalance, not discussing it with his wife first might lead to resentment or conflict. Parents typically make joint decisions about their children's finances, so acting unilaterally could be problematic.\n\nHowever, the husband might argue that the wife's behavior was unfair, so he felt compelled to act. The key issue here is communication. If the husband had a conversation with his wife about their differing approaches to money management and spending, they might have found a mutual solution. Instead, he took matters into his own hands, which could be seen as disrespectful to his wife's role as a parent.\n\nAlso, the son is an adult, so the parents might have agreed on how to handle his expenses. The husband's secret support could disrupt the agreed-upon financial arrangements. While the husband's actions might be well-intentioned, the lack of transparency with his wife is a problem.\n\nIn many cases, parental co-decision making is important. Even if one parent feels the other is being too strict or too lenient, the appropriate step would be to discuss it and find a compromise, not to bypass the other parent. The husband's actions could be seen as undermining his wife's authority and creating a situation where the son might not learn proper financial responsibility if one parent is compensating for the other's strictness.\n\nOn the other hand, if the wife's criticism of the son's spending was excessive and hypocritical, the husband might feel justified in helping. But the method of doing so without her knowledge is where the problem lies. It's about how the issue is handled rather than the intention.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband's action of giving money without his wife's knowledge is a breach of trust and joint decision-making in the marriage. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
