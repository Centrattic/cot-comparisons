When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the parent gave their son money without the wife's knowledge. The family isn't struggling financially, but there's a big disparity in how much each person spends. The wife criticizes the son for spending $7 on a meal, but then the dad finds out she spent $160 on perfume. The dad then gives the son money secretly to help him out, thinking it's unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents agreed to let the son live at home while in university, which is a common arrangement. The dad feels the wife is being overly critical of the son's expenses, especially when she spends a lot more herself. The dad's action of giving money secretly might be to balance what he sees as unfair treatment.\n\nBut here's the thing: in a marriage, especially when managing finances, transparency is usually key. Even if the wife's criticism seems harsh, the dad bypassing her by giving money without her knowledge could be seen as undermining her. It might create tension or mistrust. The dad might think he's helping the son, but he's not respecting the wife's role in household finances. Also, the son might not know about the parent's financial situation and could get used to getting money without understanding where it's coming from.\n\nOn the other hand, the dad is trying to correct what he perceives as an unfair double standard. The wife's reaction to the $7 meal versus her own $160 purchase could be seen as hypocritical. But the dad's solution is to act behind her back, which complicates things. Maybe a better approach would have been to discuss the spending habits as a family or talk to the wife about the issue instead of secretly giving money.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the lack of communication. The dad's intention might be good, but the method is problematic. In a relationship, finances are typically shared responsibilities, so acting without the spouse's knowledge can lead to more problems. The author is in the wrong for not discussing this with his wife and for secretly giving money, which could be seen as deceitful.\n"
