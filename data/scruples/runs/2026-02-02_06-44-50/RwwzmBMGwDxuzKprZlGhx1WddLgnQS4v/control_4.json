When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here.\n\nSo the situation is that the dad gave his son money without telling his wife, even though they agreed he could stay at home during university. The family isn't poor, but there's a big discrepancy in how much each person spends. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, but then the dad found out she spent $160 on perfume. He was upset by that and started giving the son money secretly to cover his expenses. The question is, is the author (the dad) wrong for doing this?\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The dad and wife had an agreement about the son living at home. The wife was upset about the $7 meal, but the dad noticed her spending more on perfume. The dad then gave money to the son without the wife knowing. The son is an adult and uses the money responsibly.\n\nPossible angles: The dad might think the wife is being unfair by focusing on the son's small spending while she spends much more. However, the dad acted without her knowledge, which could be a breach of trust. Also, the wife might feel disrespected if her spending is being compared and she wasn't part of the decision to give money.\n\nOn one hand, the dad is trying to support his son, who is an adult, and the money isn't an issue. On the other hand, he went behind his wife's back, which could cause conflict. The wife's criticism might be about the son learning financial responsibility, but if the dad is covering the costs, that undermines her teaching. The dad's action could be seen as undermining the wife's authority in the household or as a way to correct what he perceives as unfair treatment.\n\nBut since he didn't communicate with his wife about his actions, it's possible he's in the wrong because he didn't discuss the financial support with her, especially if they had agreed on the son staying at home. Maybe they had an unspoken agreement about expenses, and the dad's secret support could create resentment or confusion. Also, giving money to a son without the spouse's knowledge can be a sensitive issue in a relationship, even if the intention is good.\n\nAlternatively, if the wife's behavior was unreasonable (yelling at the son for $7 but spending $160 on perfume), the dad might feel the need to step in to protect the son and balance the expectations. But the way he did it\u2014without discussion\u2014could be problematic.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the dad's approach is considered respectful and communicative. Since he acted without telling his wife, it's more likely he's in the wrong (A) because he undermined her and didn't address the issue together. However, some might argue that the wife's reaction was excessive, making the dad's action justified (B). \n\nBut the standard here is usually about the method. Even if the wife was being unreasonable, the dad should have talked to her instead of giving money secretly. So probably A (he's in the wrong) because he didn't communicate and made a unilateral decision.\n"
