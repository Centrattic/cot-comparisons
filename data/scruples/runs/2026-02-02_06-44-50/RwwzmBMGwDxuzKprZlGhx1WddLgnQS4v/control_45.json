When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent giving money to their son without the other parent's knowledge. Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let their son stay at home during university. The family isn't short on money, but there's a big disparity in how each family member spends. The wife criticizes the son for spending $7 on a meal, but then the husband notices she spent $160 on perfume. He confronts her, which upsets her. Then, the husband starts giving the son money secretly.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the husband is right to give money to the son without his wife's knowledge. The husband thinks there's unfairness in how much each spends, but he's taking a direct action that could undermine their joint financial management. Even though he's trying to help the son, doing it without his wife's input might cause more problems. Financial decisions in a marriage usually require mutual agreement. Also, the wife's criticism of the son's spending versus her own higher expenditure might be a valid point, but the husband's solution of secretly funding the son is problematic. It could lead to a lack of communication and trust. The wife's reaction shows she's sensitive about how money is used, so the husband bypassing her might be the real issue here. Therefore, the husband is in the wrong because he didn't address the spending habits as a couple and instead took unilateral action."
