When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that the father is giving his son money without the wife's knowledge. They live together, and there's some tension over spending.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The parents agreed to let their son live at home during university. The father's son spent $7 on a meal, and the wife scolded him. The father defended his son, pointing out the wife spent $160 on perfume. Then the father started secretly giving the son money.\n\nThe question is whether the father is in the wrong. So, the main issues here are: 1) The parents' agreement about the son living at home and financial expectations. 2) The wife's reaction to the son's spending versus her own. 3) The father giving the son money without the wife's knowledge.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, financial decisions are typically shared responsibilities. If the parents agreed to let the son live at home, they might have discussed financial contributions or allowances. If the father is giving the son money without the wife's knowledge, that could be seen as undermining their shared agreement. The wife's criticism of the $7 meal might be about teaching budgeting, while the father's action of giving money might be trying to support the son's independence. However, doing it secretly could lead to trust issues. The father's defense about the perfume is about perceived hypocrisy, but that's a separate issue. \n\nThe key point is that the father is making a financial decision without involving the wife, which could be a problem in their relationship. Even if their household has enough money, the way they manage finances should ideally be mutual. So, the father might be in the wrong because he's acting unilaterally, which can cause conflict and lack of transparency.\n"
