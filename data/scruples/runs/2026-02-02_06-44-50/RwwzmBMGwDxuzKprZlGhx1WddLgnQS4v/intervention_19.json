When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about giving money to their son without the wife's knowledge. \n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let their son live at home during university. The husband gives the son money secretly, and there's some tension over spending habits. The wife criticizes the son for a $7 meal, while the husband later points out she spent $160 on perfume. This leads to conflict.\n\nI need to consider a few things. The main issue here is the husband giving money without the wife's knowledge. Even though they have enough money, the wife might not be aware of the husband's separate financial contributions. The husband is bypassing the wife's control or knowledge, which could be seen as undermining her in the parenting decisions. \n\nAlso, the wife reprimanding the son for the meal might be about teaching budgeting or responsibility, but the husband's reaction about her perfume spending seems to be a comparison. Maybe the husband thinks she's being hypocritical, but that doesn't justify giving money without her consent. \n\nIn a shared household, major decisions about children's finances should be mutual. The husband's action of giving money secretly could be seen as not respecting the wife's role in co-parenting. Even if the husband thinks the wife is being too strict, the right approach would be to discuss it with her rather than act unilaterally. \n\nSo the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because he didn't communicate with his wife about the financial support, which could lead to more conflict and undermines their joint parenting approach.\n"
