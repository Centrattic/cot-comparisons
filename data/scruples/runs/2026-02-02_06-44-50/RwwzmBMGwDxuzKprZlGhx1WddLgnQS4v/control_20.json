When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the father gave his son money without the wife's knowledge, and there's some tension around money usage.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let their son stay at home during university. The wife is upset when the son spends $7 on a meal, but the father is okay with it. Then the father finds out the wife spent $160 on perfume, which he sees as inconsistent. He then starts giving the son money without the wife's knowledge.\n\nSo, the main issue is the father acting without the wife's knowledge. In a shared household, financial decisions, even for a child, might typically require mutual agreement. The father felt the wife's criticism of the son's spending was unfair, but that's a separate issue. By not discussing the decision to give money to the son with his wife, he's going behind her back. That could be seen as undermining the wife's role in their financial decisions or the parenting approach. Even if the wife was being harsh, the father should have addressed it with her directly rather than secretly providing money. The wife might feel disrespected or that her opinions on the son's spending aren't being taken into account. So, the father's action of giving money without informing his wife could be considered wrong, especially since money management in a marriage is usually a joint responsibility. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
