When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the dad gave his son money without his wife's knowledge. The parents agreed to let their son live at home during university. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, but then the dad found out she spent $160 on perfume. So he decided to give the son money secretly, thinking there's a fairness issue.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the dad giving money without telling his wife. That could lead to problems because it's a joint household, right? They probably share financial responsibilities, so making a big decision like giving money to the son without her knowing might be a breach of trust. Even if the dad's intention was to balance things out, the way he did it was secretive. \n\nThe dad feels the wife is being unfair by criticizing the son's $7 meal while she spends $160 on perfume. But is that a valid comparison? The wife might have different priorities in her spending. Maybe the $160 perfume is a one-time expense versus the son's regular meals. Also, the dad's reaction was to address it by confronting her, but instead of resolving the issue together, he took matters into his own hands by secretly giving money. \n\nAnother angle: the dad is trying to support his son, which is understandable, but doing it without his wife's knowledge could cause more conflict. The wife might feel disrespected or betrayed. Even if money isn't tight for the family, the way they manage finances is their own business. The dad's actions might undermine the wife's role in household management. \n\nAlso, the son is an adult now, but living at home. It's unclear if the parents have agreed on a financial arrangement for him. If the dad is giving him money without the wife's knowledge, it might create confusion or resentment. The wife might feel that her financial boundaries are being crossed.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the dad's intention was to address what he saw as unfairness, but his method was wrong. He should have discussed the issue with his wife first instead of acting unilaterally. By giving the son money without her knowing, he's not only acting without transparency but also potentially creating a bigger problem in their marriage. The wife's reaction to the son's spending might be due to different values or budgeting priorities, which the dad didn't address properly. \n\nTherefore, the author (the dad) is in the wrong because he didn't communicate with his wife and acted behind her back, which is a breach of trust and could harm their relationship.\n"
