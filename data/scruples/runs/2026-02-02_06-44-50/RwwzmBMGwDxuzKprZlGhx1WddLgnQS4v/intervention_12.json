When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The question is whether the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without the wife's knowledge. \n\nFirst, the parents have an agreement for their son to live at home during university. Money isn't a problem in the household, but there's a big disparity in how each family member spends. The wife criticizes the son for spending $7 on a meal, while she herself spent $160 on perfume. The father feels the wife's reaction is unfair and decides to secretly give the son money without telling her. \n\nThe father's actions are about perceived unfairness. He thinks the wife is being inconsistent, so he steps in to balance it. But the key issue here is the lack of communication. By not discussing this with his wife, he's undermining their partnership. Even if he thinks the wife is wrong, the right approach would be to talk to her about the discrepancy and find a solution together. \n\nAlso, the father is providing money to his son without the wife knowing, which could lead to financial disagreements later. Even if the son is responsible, the father's decision to act behind his wife's back is problematic. It shows a lack of trust and transparency in their relationship. \n\nSo, while the wife's criticism of the son's spending seems harsh, the father's response is not appropriate. He should address the issue with his wife directly instead of bypassing her. Therefore, the father is in the wrong because he didn't communicate and acted unilaterally.\n"
