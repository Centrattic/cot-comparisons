When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The couple has a son in university, living at home. They're not poor, but there's a big difference in how each family member spends money. The wife scolded the son for spending $7 on a meal, but then the father found out she spent $160 on perfume. The father then started giving the son money secretly, which led to conflict with the wife.\n\nThe key points here are about fairness and communication. The father is upset about the double standard\u2014the wife criticizes the son's $7 expense but spends $160 on herself. He feels the need to compensate by giving the son money without telling the wife. But is that justified?\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, keeping financial decisions a secret between spouses is usually problematic. Even if the father feels the wife is being unfair, the solution shouldn't involve bypassing her. Open communication is important. Instead of secretly giving money, he should have discussed the issue with her. The wife might have her own reasons for the $160 perfume, maybe it's a special occasion, or she values it differently. Without knowing, the father is making assumptions.\n\nAlso, the father's action of giving money without consent could create resentment later. The wife might feel disrespected or that her authority as a parent is undermined. Even if the son is mature, the father's decision bypasses the wife's role in their co-parenting agreement.\n\nThe father's intention might be to protect the son from the wife's criticism, but the method is flawed. The right approach would be to address the perceived unfairness through dialogue, not by acting unilaterally. So, the author is in the wrong because he didn't communicate with his wife and made a decision that affects their shared household and parenting responsibilities. The answer should be A.\n"
