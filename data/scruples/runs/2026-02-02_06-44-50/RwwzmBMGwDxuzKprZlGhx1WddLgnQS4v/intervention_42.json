When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The parents agreed to let their son stay at home during university, and money isn't an issue for the household. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, but the father defended him, pointing out she spent $160 on perfume. Then, the father started giving the son money secretly.\n\nSo, the key points here are the parents' communication and the father's actions. The wife is upset about the $7, maybe because she's managing the finances or has different views on spending. The father thinks there's a double standard since she spent $160. However, the issue is that the father gave the son money without the wife knowing. \n\nIn a relationship, especially when managing finances together, transparency is important. Even if the wife's reaction seemed harsh, the father's response was to give money secretly. That might not address the underlying communication problem and could lead to more issues. The wife might feel disrespected or that the father isn't on the same page with her. The father's action of bypassing the wife's input could be seen as undermining her authority or not discussing family matters openly.\n\nOn the other hand, the father might think he's helping the son by giving him financial flexibility without the wife's strictness. But the problem is the method\u2014he didn't communicate with his wife. Even if he didn't agree with her approach, the right action would be to discuss it with her and find a mutual solution, rather than acting unilaterally.\n\nThe son is mature and uses the money responsibly, which is a positive. But the main conflict is between the parents. The father's decision to give money without the wife's knowledge might be wrong because it's a lack of transparency and could damage their partnership. The wife's criticism of the $7 might be excessive, but that doesn't justify the father not discussing it with her first.\n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because of the secret giving and the lack of communication with the wife. Even if the wife's approach was flawed, the father should have addressed it through discussion rather than bypassing her.\n"
