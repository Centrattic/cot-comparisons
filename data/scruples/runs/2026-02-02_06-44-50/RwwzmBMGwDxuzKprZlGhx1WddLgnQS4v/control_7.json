When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. The story is about a family where the parents are letting their son live at home while he's in university. They have enough money, but there's a disparity in how each family member spends.\n\nThe key points here are that the father gave money to his son secretly after a conflict about spending. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, while the father found out she spent $160 on perfume. The father then started giving the son money without telling the wife. The question is whether the father is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I need to consider family dynamics and communication. The parents are supposed to be a united front for their child's upbringing. By giving the son money without the wife's knowledge, the father is creating a situation where the parents aren't aligned. This could lead to the son feeling like he can get around his mother's rules by going to his father, which is bad for the child's development and the parents' relationship.\n\nAlso, the father is undermining his wife by not respecting her decisions and not communicating with her. Even if he disagrees with her spending, he should have discussed it with her instead of acting behind her back. The fact that the family has enough money shouldn't matter as much as how they manage their finances and set boundaries for their son.\n\nAnother angle is the son's maturity. The father mentions the son is a mature adult, but giving him extra money might not be necessary if the parents are already covering his living expenses. The son should learn to manage money within the family's agreed-upon budget. If the parents can't agree on how to handle this, it's a sign of deeper issues in their marriage that need to be addressed directly, not through giving money to the son in secret.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the father is in the wrong because he's not communicating with his wife, he's creating a divide in the parenting approach, and he's enabling the son to receive money outside the family's financial agreements. The right answer would be A.\n"
