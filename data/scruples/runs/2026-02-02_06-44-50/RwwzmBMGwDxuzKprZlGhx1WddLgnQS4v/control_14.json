When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who gave their son money without the wife's knowledge is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let their son stay at home during university. Money isn't an issue for the household, but there's a big difference in how each family member spends. The wife was upset when the son spent $7 on a meal, but then the husband found out she spent $160 on perfume. He felt that was unfair and started giving the son money secretly.\n\nSo, the main points here: The husband is bypassing the wife's financial rules by giving money to the son without her knowing. Even though the family is wealthy, the wife's perspective is that she's trying to manage expenses, maybe teaching the son about budgeting. The husband, on the other hand, sees inconsistency and wants to support the son directly.\n\nBut the issue is about the husband not consulting the wife. They are a couple, and if they have an agreement about how to handle finances with their son, the husband shouldn't be acting unilaterally. Even if the wife's actions seemed unfair, the right approach might be to discuss it together, not undermine her by giving money without her knowledge.\n\nSo, the husband's action could be seen as undermining his wife's authority and the family's agreed-upon financial plan. That would make him in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
