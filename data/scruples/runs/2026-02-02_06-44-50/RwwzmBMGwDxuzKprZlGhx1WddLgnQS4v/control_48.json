When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a father giving his son money without telling his wife. The wife is upset because the son spent $7 on a meal, but she spent $160 on perfume. The father gives the son money secretly because he thinks it's unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents agreed to let their son live at home during university. The father and wife have different views on spending. The wife criticizes the son for $7, but the father notices she spent $160 on perfume. He then starts giving the son money without her knowing, which is the main issue here.\n\nThe core question is whether the father is in the wrong. The wife's reaction to the son's spending is harsh, but she's also spending a lot on herself. The father's response is to secretly support the son financially. However, giving money without the spouse's knowledge can be a problem because it's not transparent. Even if the father thinks the wife is being unfair, he should communicate better rather than act behind her back. \n\nFinancial decisions in a marriage usually require mutual agreement. By giving the son money without telling his wife, the father might be undermining their joint financial planning. The wife might have a budget or reasons for her spending habits that aren't apparent. The father's action could lead to more conflict and a lack of trust. \n\nAdditionally, the father's approach of giving money to the son might not address the underlying issue of the wife's criticism. Instead of secretly supporting the son, he should address the discrepancy in their expectations and find a solution together with his wife. Secretly giving money could create more resentment and problems in the long run.\n\nSo, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't handle the situation with transparency and communication, which is essential in a marital relationship.\n"
