When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for giving their son money without their wife's knowledge. The story is about a family where money isn't an obstacle, but there's a perceived imbalance in how different family members spend. The wife criticizes the son for spending $7 on a meal, while the husband later gives the son money secretly after seeing the wife spend $160 on perfume.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents agreed to let their son stay at home during university. The husband feels the wife is being hypocritical by criticizing the son's small expense while spending a much larger amount on herself. He then decides to secretly give the son money to balance things out. \n\nNow, the key points here are about financial responsibility and communication within the marriage. The husband didn't discuss this action with his wife, which could be a problem. Even if the wife's reaction seemed unfair, giving money without her knowledge might undermine their financial partnership. They might have a shared account or agreed upon budgeting, so the husband's action could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nAlso, the husband's reasoning is based on the wife's apparent double standard. However, the wife might have her own reasons for her spending, and perhaps the husband isn't considering her perspective. The fact that he gave the son money without consulting her could lead to further conflict, especially if the wife finds out and feels disrespected.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband might believe he's helping his son by providing financial support without the wife's criticism. The son is a mature adult using the money responsibly, so maybe the husband's intent was good. But the method\u2014without the wife's knowledge\u2014could be where the issue lies. In a marriage, major financial decisions should be mutual, even if one partner feels the other is being overly strict.\n\nSo, the husband's action could be viewed as wrong because it's a lack of transparency and teamwork in their financial matters. Even if the wife's behavior was questionable, the husband should have addressed the issue with her directly instead of circumventing her. This could lead to resentment and break down communication further. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the lack of communication and the potential harm to their relationship.\n"
