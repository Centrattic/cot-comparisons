When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving money to his son without his wife's knowledge. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple agreed to let their son stay at home during university. The father gives the son money secretly because the wife criticized the son for a $7 meal while she spent $160 on perfume. The father is upset about the perceived inconsistency in spending and decides to secretly support his son financially.\n\nI need to determine if the father is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points.\n\n1. **Marital Agreement on Finances**: Typically, in a marriage, financial decisions, especially involving shared resources, are expected to be mutual. The father is using their shared money (since they have \"way more than enough\" and the wife spends $160 on perfume) to give to their son without her consent. This could be seen as undermining the wife's authority or creating conflict by not discussing it together.\n\n2. **Hypocrisy vs. Fairness**: The wife is upset about the son's $7 meal, but she spent $160 on perfume. The father feels this is unfair. However, the wife's spending on perfume is a personal choice, while the son's meal is for sustenance. But the father's response was to give the son money secretly, which might be a way to challenge his wife's control, but it's a covert action rather than open discussion.\n\n3. **Intent and Consequences**: The father's intent was to support his son and correct what he saw as unfair treatment. However, the method (not informing the wife) could lead to distrust. The wife might feel disrespected or that her concerns are being overridden without discussion. Even if the wife's criticism seemed harsh, the husband's solution bypasses communication, which is crucial in relationships.\n\n4. **Parental Role**: Both parents have a role in their child's upbringing. The father might feel the need to protect his son from the wife's criticism, but doing so without her knowledge could create more problems. The son might also be caught in the middle, not knowing to take sides.\n\n5. **Financial Disproportion**: The user mentions that money isn't an obstacle, but the distribution is uneven. However, the father's action of giving money without consent could exacerbate the imbalance. The wife might feel her financial management is questioned, leading to more conflict.\n\nIn many relationships, major financial decisions, especially involving children, are considered joint responsibilities. The father's action, while perhaps well-intentioned, could be seen as undermining the wife's role and creating secrecy. The right approach would be to address the spending habits as a couple, perhaps through discussion or counseling, rather than unilateral actions.\n\nTherefore, the father is in the wrong because he didn't communicate with his wife and took matters into his own hands, which can damage trust and cooperation in the marriage.\n"
