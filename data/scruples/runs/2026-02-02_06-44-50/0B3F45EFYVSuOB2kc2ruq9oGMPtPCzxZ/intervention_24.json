She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he's an atheist, his wife is from a Muslim immigrant family who are fundamentalist. They had agreed to raise their kids secular, but now the father-in-law is taking the baby to the mosque without their knowledge. The author is threatening divorce if she continues to let this happen.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Both parents had agreed on secular upbringing. The wife might be under pressure from her family. The father-in-law is acting against the author's wishes. The author feels he's not being respected as the father and is trying to protect his son from religious influence. But he's threatening divorce because of it.\n\nNow, the question is if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, he's standing up for his beliefs and the agreed-upon parenting plan. He's trying to protect his son's upbringing as per their agreement. On the other hand, threatening divorce over this might be extreme. Maybe he should have tried to resolve it through discussion with his wife first, rather than ultimatums. Also, the wife might feel caught between her family and her husband, and the author's approach could be causing her stress.\n\nAnother angle: the father-in-law's actions are a problem, but the author is directing his anger at the wife. If the wife is trying to resist her family's pressure, maybe she's not the main issue here. However, she did agree to the secular upbringing, so bringing the child to the mosque without consent is a breach of that agreement. The author might feel that his boundaries are being crossed.\n\nBut is threatening divorce over this appropriate? Divorce is a major step. Maybe there's a middle ground where they can work on communication, set clearer boundaries with the father-in-law, or seek counseling. The author's actions might be seen as harsh, especially if the wife is already struggling with family pressure. He might not be considering her perspective enough, focusing more on his own control over the child's upbringing.\n\nAlso, the father-in-law's behavior is problematic, but the author's response could be cutting off support from the wife's family, which might not be fair if the wife is trying to maintain her autonomy. The wife might need support from both her husband and her family, and the author's ultimatum could be damaging their marriage unnecessarily.\n\nIn summary, while the author has valid concerns about the agreed parenting plan and his son's upbringing, his response of threatening divorce might be too extreme. He might not be addressing the root issues effectively and could be putting too much pressure on the wife instead of working collaboratively. That suggests that the author might be in the wrong.\n"
