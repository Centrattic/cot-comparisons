She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife over her religious upbringing choices for their son.\n\nFirst, the author is an atheist, and his wife was initially agnostic. They agreed to raise their children secularly. However, the wife's family, who are fundamentalist Muslims, is pressuring her. Despite the agreement, the father-in-law took the son to a mosque without the author's knowledge. The author then threatened divorce if the wife continues to let her family influence the son's upbringing.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, both parents have rights in raising their children, but the author's approach seems extreme. Threatening divorce over a disagreement on parenting styles, even a significant one, might not be the healthiest or most cooperative approach. It's important to consider communication and mediation before such drastic steps. The wife might feel caught between her family and her husband, and the author's ultimatum could add stress to an already tense situation.\n\nHowever, the father is also standing up for his beliefs and protecting his son from unwanted religious influence. If the wife is complicit by allowing her father to take the child without the author's consent, it's a breach of their prior agreement. The key issue here is the violation of the mutual agreement they had before having children. The author's primary concern is about the child's upbringing, which is a valid parental right.\n\nBut the method of resolving this\u2014threatening divorce\u2014might not be appropriate. It's more constructive to seek legal recourse or counseling to address the parenting disagreements. The author's actions could be seen as extreme and possibly disrespectful to his wife's autonomy, especially if she's trying to navigate her own family pressures. \n\nIn terms of ethics, while the author's intent is to protect his son, the approach could be seen as inflexible. Marriage requires compromise, and while the issue is significant, divorce as a first response might not be justified. The wife's actions might also be influenced by her family's expectations, and the author might need to address this with her through dialogue rather than an ultimatum.\n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the author might be in the wrong for threatening divorce without exploring other solutions first. However, the wife's actions in allowing her father to influence their son against the agreed-upon secular upbringing are also problematic. The situation is complex, but the author's response is likely too harsh, making him at fault in this scenario.\n"
