She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking for an opinion on whether the person who posted the situation is at fault. Let me start by breaking down the key points of the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author is married to a woman from a fundamentalist Muslim immigrant family. They had agreed that their children would be raised secularly, with the option to choose their religion when they grow up. The author is an atheist, and his wife was previously agnostic. However, after the birth of their son, the author discovers that his wife's father is taking the son to the mosque and dressing him in Muslim clothes without consent.\n\nThe author feels that his father-in-law is exerting control over his wife and his son against his wishes. He also mentions that his wife is happy at home but becomes depressed when interacting with her father. The author has told his wife that if she continues to allow this, he will divorce her.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the possible angles. The author is a parent and is concerned about his son being raised in a religion he disagrees with. He has made it clear that he wants a secular upbringing. However, the wife is bringing the child into contact with her family, who are imposing religious practices. \n\nIn many places, both parents have equal rights in making decisions about their child's upbringing. Since the author is the father, he has a right to be involved in these decisions. However, the wife might feel that her family is important to her and that she wants to maintain her cultural or religious heritage for the child. There's a conflict here between the parents' views on religion and upbringing.\n\nThe author's threat to divorce is a significant issue. Using divorce as a consequence for disagreements in parenting styles can be seen as extreme. However, if the wife is going against the agreed-upon parenting plan that they had before having children, the author might feel justified in taking such a stance. The key point here is whether the wife is acting against his wishes and the prior agreement they had.\n\nAnother aspect is the father-in-law's actions. He is taking the child without the author's consent, which is a violation of the father's rights. The author has the right to be involved in decisions regarding his child's upbringing, and the father-in-law's interference without permission is problematic.\n\nThe wife's role is also in question. If she knew about her father's actions and allowed them, that could be seen as her not respecting her husband's wishes. However, she might be caught between her loyalty to her family and her marriage. It's possible that she's under pressure from her family and might not be fully aware of the extent of her father's actions until after the fact.\n\nLegal perspectives might vary, but generally, both parents have a say in their child's upbringing. If one parent is unilaterally making decisions that the other disagrees with, it could lead to conflict. The author's response is to threaten divorce, which might be a reaction to feeling that his parental rights are being violated. However, threatening divorce over such issues could be seen as extreme unless there are other underlying problems in the marriage.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author believes he's protecting his son from religion he opposes. The wife might feel that she's honoring her cultural background. The situation is complex, but the author's ultimatum seems harsh. Divorce is a major step, especially if the wife is not directly complicit in the father-in-law's actions. It's possible that the wife is also a victim of family pressure and isn't intentionally going against her husband's wishes.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions are a response to a breach of their prior agreement and potential violation of his parental rights. However, using divorce as a threat might be seen as too extreme. The wife's role in allowing her father's actions could be a point of contention, but if she's not directly involved, the author's approach might not be justified. The situation requires a balance between respecting parental rights and addressing the underlying issues in the marriage and family dynamics.\n"
