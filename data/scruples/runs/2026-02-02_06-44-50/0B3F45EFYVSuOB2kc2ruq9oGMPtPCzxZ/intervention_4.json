She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is an atheist, his wife is from a Muslim immigrant family. They agreed to raise their kids secular. The wife was also agnostic before they got married. Now that they have a son, the wife's father is taking the kid to the mosque without the author's knowledge. The author is threatening divorce if she continues to let this happen.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, both parents have the right to be involved in their child's upbringing. But the author is making a threat of divorce based on the wife's actions. The wife might feel trapped between her family's expectations and her agreement with her husband. The fact that her family is pressuring her and even taking the child without consent is a problem. The author is trying to protect his child from religion, but is it right to use divorce as a threat?\n\nAlso, the wife might be in a difficult position. She might be complying with her family's wishes to some extent despite her initial agreement with her husband. The author's father-in-law is acting against the author's wishes, which complicates things. The key issue here is the agreement they had. If the wife agreed to secular upbringing, but her family is interfering, then she might be the one not following through. But if she's being pressured by her family and the author is not supporting her in resisting that pressure, maybe he's being too strict.\n\nWait, the author says he's told her many times to stop, but she continues. He feels that the father-in-law is controlling the wife. The wife might be struggling with her family's influence. The author's ultimatum is harsh, but if raising the child against his beliefs is important to him, maybe he has a point. However, using divorce as a threat over this could be seen as extreme. Also, the wife might feel she doesn't have a choice if her family is pressuring her. \n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's right to raise the child secular versus the wife's family's influence and her compliance. If the wife is actively allowing her father to take the child, maybe she's violating their agreement. But if she's being coerced by her family and the author isn't helping her resist that, maybe he's not considering her situation. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's actions are based on his beliefs, but threatening divorce is a heavy consequence. It's possible that the wife is being manipulated by her family, and the author isn't addressing the root issue effectively. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not handling the situation with more empathy and seeking a solution other than divorce. But if the agreement was clear and the wife is breaking it, then maybe he's justified. \n\nI think the key here is whether the wife is actively going against their agreement or if she's being forced by her family. If she's being forced, then the author's threat might be premature. But if she's choosing to let her father take the child, then he's justified. The story is a bit unclear on that. The wife is described as being happy when they are together but comes back depressed after seeing her father. That suggests she's conflicted and possibly not in control of the situation. \n\nGiven that, the author might be overreacting. The wife's family's actions are undermining their agreement, and if she can't control her father, maybe the author should work with her to address that rather than threatening divorce. So, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because he's using an ultimatum without considering the wife's situation and the family pressure she's under.\n"
