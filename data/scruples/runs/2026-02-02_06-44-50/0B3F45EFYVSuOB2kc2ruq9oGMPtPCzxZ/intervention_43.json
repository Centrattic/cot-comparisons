She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the original post) is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife if she continues to raise their son as Muslim. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation from both sides. The author is an atheist, his wife was agnostic when they married, but she comes from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They agreed to raise their kids secularly. However, the author's father-in-law is pressuring the wife and the wife is allowing her father to take the son to the mosque and dress him in Muslim clothes without the author's knowledge. The author feels that his son is being influenced against his wishes and is threatening divorce if this continues.\n\nNow, considering the laws and societal norms. In many places, both parents have the right to have a say in their child's upbringing, but there are also laws that protect children's rights to religious freedom and that parents must act in the child's best interest. However, if one parent is actively trying to convert the child without the other's consent, that could be a problem. But in this case, the wife might be under pressure from her family, which complicates things.\n\nThe author's stance is that he wants the child to be raised secularly, which is his right as a parent. However, threatening divorce over this issue might be seen as extreme. Marriage involves compromise, and if the wife is allowing her father to influence the child behind the husband's back, that's a breach of trust. But the husband is standing by his decision not to allow the child to be raised in a certain religion against his wishes. \n\nAnother angle is the wife's autonomy. The author says she's an adult and can choose, but he's making a decision that affects her as well. If she's willing to comply with her father's actions despite the husband's objections, maybe she's making her own choices. However, she might also be under pressure from her family, which the author might not fully understand. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the father-in-law's behavior. Taking the child without consent is problematic. The author is justified in being upset about this, but his response (threatening divorce) might be too harsh. Divorce over religious upbringing is a significant step, but if it's a core value for the author, he might feel it's necessary.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might not be in the wrong because he's standing up for his beliefs and the child's upbringing. However, the threat of divorce could be seen as excessive unless the issue is non-negotiable. On the other hand, if the wife is actively violating the agreed-upon terms of raising the child secularly, the author has a valid reason to be upset. \n\nBut the key point is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether threatening divorce over this issue is justified. If the wife is not respecting the agreement and the father-in-law is interfering, the author's reaction might be understandable. However, if the wife is also part of the problem by not standing up to her father, the situation is more complex. \n\nIn many cases, parents have the right to make decisions about their child's religion, but when there's a conflict between parents, it can lead to legal battles. Here, the author is taking a firm stand, which might be his right, but the method (threatening divorce) could be seen as extreme. However, if the religious upbringing is a deal-breaker for him, it's his choice to leave the marriage. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
