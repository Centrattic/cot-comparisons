She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with differing religious beliefs and a conflict over how their son is raised.\n\nFirst, the husband is an atheist, and the wife was initially agnostic but comes from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They agreed to raise their children secularly, but after the son's birth, the wife's father took the child to the mosque without the husband's consent. The husband feels that the in-law's influence is against his wishes, leading him to threaten divorce if the situation continues.\n\nKey points to consider: The couple had an agreement on secular upbringing. The husband's main issue is the father-in-law's actions against his wishes, which the wife might be enabling. The wife's family dislikes the husband, which adds tension. The husband is concerned about his son's upbringing and is standing by his initial agreement. The wife's well-being is also a factor, as she becomes depressed after seeing her father.\n\nIs the husband wrong to prioritize his beliefs? The father-in-law's actions are a problem, but the wife is an adult. However, the husband is the father too, so he has a right to be involved in the child's upbringing. The wife might need to mediate between her family and her husband's wishes. The threat of divorce is serious, but if the wife continues to go against the agreement without his consent, it's a breach of their agreement. The husband is asserting his parental rights, which is valid. However, the approach might be too harsh. Maybe there's a middle ground, but the core issue is the violation of their prior agreement. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
