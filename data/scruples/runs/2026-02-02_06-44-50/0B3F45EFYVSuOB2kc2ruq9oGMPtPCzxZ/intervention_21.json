She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple with differing religious views regarding their child's upbringing.\n\nFirst, the author is an atheist, and the wife was initially agnostic but comes from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They agreed to raise their son secularly. The husband is upset because the wife's father took their son to the mosque without permission, and the wife seems to be allowing this. The husband threatens divorce if the wife continues to expose their son to Islam.\n\nKey points to consider: Both parents have a right to influence their child's upbringing, but there's a conflict here. The husband feels his wishes are being disregarded. The wife's family is pressuring her, which might be affecting her decisions. The father-in-law's actions might be overstepping, especially without the husband's consent.\n\nLegally, both parents have equal rights, but since the child is an infant, the primary caregiver's influence is significant. The husband's ultimatum about divorce could be seen as extreme, but he's standing up for his beliefs. The wife's actions might be influenced by her family pressure, which complicates things.\n\nEthically, it's about mutual respect and compromise. The husband's stance is firm, but threatening divorce over differing religious practices might be harsh. The wife's compliance with her family's wishes despite her previous agreement with her husband could be a point against her. However, the father-in-law's unauthorized actions are problematic.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the situation is complex. The husband has a right to be involved in his child's upbringing, but his response of threatening divorce might be disproportionate. The wife might be struggling between her husband's wishes and her family's influence. The father-in-law's actions are definitely overreaching.\n\nSo, the author's position is understandable given his perspective, but his response (threatening divorce) might not be the best approach. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Considering all factors, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because he's asserting his parental rights, but the situation requires nuance.\n"
