She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong after threatening to divorce his wife if she continues to raise their son as Muslim.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is an atheist, his wife was agnostic when they married, but her family is fundamentalist Muslim. They agreed to raise their kids secular. However, the author's father-in-law is pressuring the wife to raise the son as Muslim, even taking him to the mosque without the author's knowledge. The author is upset because he doesn't want his son raised in that religion against his wishes. He's said he'll divorce her if she continues, which the wife seems to be doing, possibly under pressure from her family.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide if that's accurate. The key points here are the initial agreement, the father-in-law's actions, and the author's response.\n\nThe author and wife had an agreement on secular upbringing. If the wife is breaking that agreement by allowing the father-in-law to influence their son, then the author might feel justified in his stance. However, the author's response is to threaten divorce. Divorce is a serious action, and the question is whether the author is in the wrong for making that ultimatum.\n\nBut wait, the wife might be under pressure from her family. The author acknowledges she's an adult and can do what she wants, but he's not okay with the father-in-law influencing the child. However, the wife is the one allowing this to happen. So maybe the author is right in protecting his son's upbringing as per their mutual agreement. But does the father have the right to dictate the child's religious upbringing, especially in a custody context?\n\nIn many legal systems, both parents have a say in the child's upbringing, but if they're married, they need to agree. If the father-in-law is acting without permission, that's an issue. However, the wife's actions are the main problem here. The author feels that by allowing the father-in-law to influence the son, she's violating their agreement. \n\nBut does the author have the right to force her to follow through on the agreement by threatening divorce? Or is this an overreaction? Divorce over this might be extreme, but if the author is committed to secular upbringing and this is a non-negotiable for him, perhaps it's justified. However, the wife might feel that she's trying to balance her family's expectations and her own beliefs. The author might be overreacting, especially if the wife is also being controlled by her family.\n\nAnother angle: the father-in-law is acting without permission, which the author has communicated. The wife's complicity in this might be a breach of their agreement, so the author's response is about enforcing the agreement. However, threatening divorce is a heavy punishment. Maybe there are other ways to address the issue first, like legal action or mediation.\n\nBut the author says he's told her many times, and she continues. So perhaps he's given her chances to comply. The father-in-law's actions are problematic, but the wife's continued cooperation is the root of the conflict. The author's stance is about protecting his son's upbringing, which is a significant concern. However, the use of an ultimatum for divorce might be seen as extreme, especially if the wife is also struggling with her family's pressure.\n\nIn some cultures, family pressure is very strong, and the wife might feel trapped. The author's threat could be seen as dismissive of her situation. But the author is also a parent with his own beliefs. It's a complex situation where both parties have valid points but are at an impasse. \n\nThe user's opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. If the author's main issue is the father-in-law's actions, but the wife is enabling them, then the author has a right to be upset. However, threatening divorce over this might be an overreaction unless all other options are exhausted. Alternatively, if the initial agreement was clear and the wife is breaking it, the author is justified in holding her accountable. \n\nIn terms of parenting decisions, in many places, both parents have equal say, but if they're not in agreement, the court might consider the child's best interest. However, since the author is the father, he has a legal right to be involved in the child's upbringing. \n\nSo, considering all this, I'm torn. The author might not be in the wrong because he's protecting his son's upbringing as agreed. However, the ultimatum of divorce might not be the best approach. But the user's question is whether he's in the wrong. If the wife is complicit in violating their agreement, then the author's threat is a consequence of that action. So maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the wife is under pressure and the author is not giving her support, perhaps he's not considering her perspective. But the agreement was mutual. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's upholding the agreement they made regarding their child's upbringing. However, the method of response could be debated. But the question is whether he's in the wrong, not whether his approach is the best. Since the wife is breaking their agreement by allowing the father-in-law's influence, the author has a right to take a strong stance.\n"
