She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple's disagreement over raising their son. The husband is an atheist, the wife was previously agnostic but now her family, who are fundamentalist Muslims, wants the child to be raised Muslim. The husband says they agreed on secular upbringing, but the wife's father has taken the son to the mosque without consent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband and wife initially agreed on secular raising. The wife's family is pressuring her, and despite the husband's objections, the father took the child to the mosque. The husband threatened divorce if the wife continues to allow this. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to confirm.\n\nThe main issue is parental rights and religious upbringing. In many places, both parents have equal rights unless a court decides otherwise. Since the child is very young, the father might be concerned about the influence of the family. However, the wife might feel caught between her husband and her family. \n\nThe husband's threat of divorce over this is a big step. Divorce over differing religious views can be justified if it's about the child's upbringing, but it's also a significant life decision. The father-in-law acting without consent is problematic, but the wife's role in allowing or not preventing this is a factor. The wife might feel pressured by her family, but she's an adult and responsible for her actions.\n\nThe husband's stance is about protecting his son from unwanted religious influence, which is his right. However, threatening divorce immediately might be seen as extreme. It's possible that mediation or legal steps would be more appropriate than an ultimatum. The wife's family's behavior is also questionable, especially taking the child without permission.\n\nBut the husband's actions\u2014telling his wife he'll divorce her if she doesn't comply with his wishes\u2014could be seen as controlling. The wife has her own rights in the matter of the child's upbringing. If the couple can't reach an agreement, maybe legal proceedings would determine custody arrangements. However, since they're married and the child is theirs, both have a say. The husband's refusal to let the father-in-law influence the child is valid, but his method of handling it might be inconsiderate of the wife's autonomy.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, parents can agree on the child's religion, but if there's a conflict, courts often consider the child's best interest. The husband's immediate threat to divorce might not be the best approach, but his concern for the child's upbringing is understandable. The wife's actions in allowing her father to take the child could be seen as going against their initial agreement, so maybe the husband isn't entirely wrong in standing his ground.\n\nHowever, the way he's handling it\u2014threatening divorce\u2014is harsh. It's possible that the wife is being manipulated or pressured by her family, and the husband isn't considering her situation. The wife might need support to stand up to her family rather than being forced into a divorce. The husband's approach might be causing more harm than good.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer is a bit nuanced. Legally, both parents have rights. Emotionally, the husband's approach might be too extreme. But ethically, he's standing up for his beliefs regarding his child's upbringing. The wife's actions might be seen as violating their initial agreement. However, threatening divorce over this might be disproportionate. The author's position is firm, but perhaps not the most constructive. So, maybe the author is not entirely wrong, but their method is questionable. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (Yes), it's because threatening divorce is too harsh. If B (No), because he's protecting his son from unwanted religion. I'm leaning towards B because the core issue is about child upbringing and the father's right to protect his child, but the method could be better. But maybe the author is in the wrong for using such an ultimatum. It's a tough call. I think the answer is B (No), because the author is justified in protecting his son's upbringing, even if the approach is extreme.\n"
