She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about parents disagreeing on how to raise their child, specifically regarding religious upbringing. The author is an atheist, and his wife used to be agnostic but now the family is pressuring her to raise their son as Muslim. The father-in-law even took the baby to the mosque without permission. The author says he wants to divorce if this continues.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The parents had an agreement before having kids that they'd be secular. The wife's family, especially her father, is pressuring them, and the father-in-law is acting without consent. The author feels his boundaries are being crossed by allowing the father-in-law to influence their son against his wishes. The wife might be struggling between her family's expectations and her own agreement with her husband.\n\nThe author's argument is about protecting his son's upbringing as per their agreement. But is threatening divorce over this issue justified? Divorce is a major step, especially over a disagreement about child-rearing. However, the father-in-law's actions are unilateral and against the husband's wishes, which could be a breach of trust. The wife's role here is also a factor\u2014she's the one who might be enabling the father's contact with the son despite the husband's objections.\n\nBut wait, the husband says he told his wife many times to stop bringing the son to his father, but she still does it. That suggests the wife isn't respecting the husband's wishes, which could lead to conflict. However, the wife might feel caught between her husband and her family, leading to stress and depression as mentioned. The author's response is to threaten divorce, which might be seen as extreme if other solutions weren't explored first.\n\nBut considering the father-in-law's actions are harmful in the author's view (unauthorized religious instruction), and the wife isn't stopping it despite the husband's clear stance, maybe the author feels desperate. The author's main concern is the child's upbringing, which is a valid parental right. However, using divorce as a threat could be seen as extreme unless there's no other way to resolve it. The wife's autonomy is also a factor\u2014she might have her own reasons for allowing her father's influence, maybe feeling torn between her husband and her family.\n\nIn some cases, parents have different opinions on religion, and resolving that without divorce requires communication and compromise. The author might not have given his wife enough support or tried mediation. But given that the father-in-law is acting against the husband's wishes and the wife isn't blocking it, the husband's frustration is understandable. However, threatening divorce over this could be seen as too harsh, especially since the child is an infant. Maybe there's a middle ground, but the author sees no other option.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is within his rights to prioritize his child's upbringing as agreed. If the wife isn't honoring that agreement, the conflict is between the couple, not just him against the in-laws. So maybe he's not in the wrong because he's standing by his original agreement. But the way he's handling it (threatening divorce) is a strong move. It's possible he's in the right to protect his child's upbringing but the method is questionable. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's the one taking the action, if the situation is as described, maybe he's justified. Alternatively, maybe there's a problem in how he's handling the conflict with his wife.\n\nI'm a bit torn here. The father's rights to his child's upbringing are important, but the response (threatening divorce) might be too severe. However, if the wife isn't cooperating and the father-in-law is acting against the husband's wishes, the husband's frustration is valid. The answer might hinge on whether the threat of divorce is appropriate given the circumstances. In some legal systems, parental rights in upbringing are significant, so the author might be justified. But in terms of relationship dynamics, threatening divorce over this without exhausting other options could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the father-in-law is violating the husband's wishes and the wife isn't stopping it, the husband's stance might be defensible. So maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
