She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a husband and wife with differing religious views. The husband is an atheist and wants their son raised secularly, while the wife comes from a Muslim background and her family is fundamentalist. They agreed before having kids to raise the child secularly. However, the wife's father has been taking the son to a mosque without the husband's knowledge, which the husband is upset about. The husband says he told his wife he would divorce her if she continues to let this happen.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, both parents have equal rights in raising their children, and a parent can't unilaterally make religious decisions without the other's consent. So the father has a right to be involved in those decisions. The mother might be violating their prior agreement by allowing her father's influence. But the mother might also feel pressured by her family and perhaps is struggling with her own beliefs.\n\nThe husband's threat of divorce seems extreme. While the issue is significant, threatening divorce over a disagreement about child-rearing can be problematic. It's important to consider whether there's been communication breakdown. The husband says he's told her many times, but maybe they need counseling or mediation instead of an ultimatum.\n\nThe father-in-law's actions are also an issue. Taking the child without permission is a breach of the parents' agreement. However, the husband's approach of confrontation might not address the root of the wife's feelings or her family's pressure. The wife might feel torn between her husband and her family, which could explain why she's allowing the father to see the child despite the agreement.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, he's standing up for his beliefs and the agreed-upon parenting plan, which is valid. However, his response of threatening divorce might be too harsh, especially if there's potential for resolution through communication or legal means. On the other hand, the mother might not be honoring the agreement, which is a separate issue. So it's a complex situation with both parties possibly having valid points. The husband's actions are a reaction to a breach of trust and agreement, but the ultimatum could be seen as extreme. So the answer might be a bit nuanced, but the user is asking for a yes or no. I think the husband is not in the wrong because he's protecting his child's upbringing as agreed, but the way he's handling it might be problematic. However, based on the options given, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
