She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. So, the author is a husband who's an atheist, and his wife is from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They agreed to raise their kids secularly. But now the wife's father is taking their son to the mosque without the husband's knowledge. The husband is threatening divorce if she continues to raise the son as Muslim.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points here. The couple had an agreement about secular upbringing. The father is adamant about not having his son exposed to religion, especially given the in-laws' disapproval and control. The wife's father is interfering by taking the child to the mosque. The wife is in a tough spot, maybe trying to balance her own beliefs and her family's pressures.\n\nThe husband is standing by his original agreement. He's not okay with his son being exposed to religious practices without his consent. Legally, in many places, both parents have equal rights in raising the child, and if one parent is acting against the other's wishes without agreement, that could be an issue. But since the wife is allowing it by not stopping her father, maybe there's a problem there.\n\nBut the husband's response is to threaten divorce. That's a big step. Is it justified? If the wife is complicit in allowing her father to influence their child against the husband's wishes, then maybe the husband is within his rights to take a firm stance. However, threatening divorce over this might be seen as extreme. Are there other ways to resolve this conflict first? Like mediation, legal action, or setting stricter boundaries?\n\nAlso, the wife's mental health is mentioned\u2014she gets depressed after visiting her father. That suggests she's not happy with the situation but might feel pressured. The husband could be overstepping if he's controlling her choices as an adult, but when it comes to their child, parental rights come into play. \n\nIn terms of morality, the husband is trying to protect his son from a religion he doesn't believe in. However, the wife might feel her own religious identity is being suppressed. The father-in-law's actions are a violation of the agreed-upon parenting plan. But the husband's ultimatum might be too harsh, especially if the wife is not actively converting the child but her father is. Is the wife responsible for her father's actions? That's a gray area.\n\nI think the key here is the original agreement. If both parents agreed to secular upbringing, then the wife's father's actions are breaching that. The husband is right to be concerned about his child's upbringing. However, the threat of divorce might be a heavy-handed approach. There could be other solutions, like legal intervention or stricter enforcement of their boundaries without ending the marriage. \n\nStill, considering the husband is standing by his original decision and the circumstances of the wife's family interfering, it's hard to say he's entirely wrong. The wife might need to take more responsibility by stopping her father's actions. The husband's stance is about protecting his son's upbringing, which is a significant issue. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but with the consideration that there's room for a more collaborative approach than an ultimatum.\n"
