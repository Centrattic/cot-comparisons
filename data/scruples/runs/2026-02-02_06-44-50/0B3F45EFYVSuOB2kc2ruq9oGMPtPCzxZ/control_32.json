She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The main issue is about a couple's disagreement over their son's religious upbringing.\n\nFirst, the husband is an atheist, and the wife was agnostic when they got married. They agreed their children would be raised secular. The wife comes from a fundamentalist Muslim family who disapprove of the husband. Now that they have a son, the wife's father is trying to involve the child in Islamic practices without the husband's consent, even taking the baby to the mosque without telling them. The husband is upset and has threatened divorce if the wife continues to allow this.\n\nI need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, both parents have equal rights in their children's upbringing, so the husband has a right to be involved and to make decisions. However, the wife might feel pressured by her family, which complicates things. The father-in-law's actions are a big part of the problem here. The husband's refusal to let the father-in-law influence their son makes sense from his perspective, but threatening divorce over this is a strong move.\n\nThe wife is an adult who might feel torn between her husband's wishes and her family's expectations. The husband's stance is about protecting his son from religion, which he sees as against their agreement. But is threatening divorce appropriate? It's a major consequence for what could be seen as a disagreement on parenting style. However, the father-in-law's actions are non-consensual, which adds weight to the husband's concerns.\n\nLegally, the husband might have grounds to be involved in decisions about religious upbringing. Ethically, it's about respecting the original agreement and protecting the child's upbringing. The husband's position is that he won't allow his son to be raised in a way that contradicts their agreement. The wife's actions (allowing the father to take the child) might be seen as breaking that agreement. However, the wife might feel she's being manipulated by her family, which is a separate issue.\n\nSo, the key points are: the original agreement was secular upbringing, the father-in-law is acting without consent, the husband feels his rights are violated, and he's taking a firm stance. The wife might be struggling with her family's influence. The husband's threat of divorce is a drastic measure, but given the circumstances, it's his way of enforcing the agreement. Whether he's in the wrong depends on viewing the situation from both sides. The husband's actions are about protecting his child's upbringing, which is a valid parental right. The wife's compliance with her family's pressure is the issue here. The husband isn't wrong in asserting his right to co-parenting decisions. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
