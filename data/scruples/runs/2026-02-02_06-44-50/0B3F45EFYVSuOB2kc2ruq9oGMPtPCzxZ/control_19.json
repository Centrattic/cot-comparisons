She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife if she continues to raise their son as Muslim. The scenario is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the religious upbringing of their son. The husband is an atheist, the wife was agnostic when they met but comes from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They agreed to raise their children secularly. But now the wife's family is involved, especially the father-in-law, who took the son to the mosque without consent. The husband is upset because he feels his wishes are being ignored, and he's threatening divorce if the situation continues.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The husband's stance is that he doesn't want their son raised in a specific religion, and he's standing by his agreement they had. The wife, on the other hand, might be caught between her family's expectations and her marriage. But she agreed to secular upbringing initially. The father-in-law's actions are a problem because he's taking the child without permission, which is a violation of the parents' agreement.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. From a legal perspective, in many places, both parents have equal rights, so the father-in-law shouldn't be making decisions without the father's consent. The husband is protecting his right to co-parent his child without interference. However, threatening divorce over this could be seen as extreme. But given the circumstances, maybe he's justified because he's standing up for his religious beliefs and the agreement made with his wife.\n\nBut wait, the wife might be complicit in allowing her father to take the child, even if they had agreed not to. The husband might feel betrayed that the wife isn't upholding their agreement. However, does threatening divorce over this make him in the wrong? It's a major decision, but if the wife is not respecting his boundaries, maybe it's a valid stance.\n\nI should also consider cultural aspects. The wife's family's opposition to the husband's background could be a factor. The husband is trying to protect his child from what he sees as forced religious indoctrination. The father-in-law's actions might be seen as overstepping, so the husband's reaction is to enforce his boundaries.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a complex situation. The husband isn't the one forcing religion on the child; he's resisting it. The wife's compliance with her family might be the issue here. The key question is whether the husband's threat is justified given the breach of their agreement and the unauthorized actions of the father-in-law.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's defending his right to raise his child secularly, which was part of their agreement, and the other parent (his wife) isn't adhering to that agreement. The father-in-law's actions are a violation, so the husband's stance is protecting his parental rights.\n"
