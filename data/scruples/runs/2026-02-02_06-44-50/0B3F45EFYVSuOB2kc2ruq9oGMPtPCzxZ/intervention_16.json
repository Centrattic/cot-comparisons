She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple with conflicting religious beliefs regarding their child's upbringing. The husband is an atheist, the wife was originally agnostic but is from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They had agreed that their kids would be raised secular. The wife's father, who disapproves of the husband, is pressuring her to take their son to the mosque and dress him in Muslim clothes, which the husband found out after the fact. The husband then threatens divorce if she continues to allow this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects of parental rights and religious upbringing. In many places, parents have the right to choose their child's religion, but there are also considerations about the child's best interests. If both parents are involved, they typically share in the decision-making. However, if there's a conflict, the court might consider the majority's religious upbringing, but that's more in cases of separation or divorce.\n\nThe husband's main argument is that they had an agreement, and the wife is going back on it by allowing her father to influence their son. The wife might be feeling torn between her husband and her family, especially if her father is exerting control. The husband is firm in his stance, even threatening divorce. That's a serious ultimatum. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, the wife is an adult and can make her own choices, but when it comes to their child, both parents have a say. If the father is insistent on not having the child exposed to Islam, and the other parent is allowing it without the father's consent, there's a conflict. The husband is asserting his parental rights. However, threatening divorce over something that's a significant part of the wife's cultural and familial background might be extreme. \n\nThe wife's family is pressuring her, which adds another layer. It's possible she's under a lot of stress, trying to balance her husband's wishes and her family's expectations. The husband's approach might be seen as not allowing her to navigate that tension, instead cutting things off entirely. \n\nAlso, the father in law's actions\u2014taking the baby to the mosque without the father's consent\u2014could be a point of contention. The husband has a right to be involved in the child's upbringing. However, the husband's threat of divorce might be disproportionate if the wife is trying to maintain some relationship with her family and is not entirely aligned with her father's actions. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in some jurisdictions, both parents have the right to make decisions about their child's upbringing, but if there's a conflict, the court might consider the child's interests. However, this is a private matter between the couple. The husband's stance is that he can't tolerate the religious upbringing against his wishes, but the wife might feel her autonomy is being undermined. \n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? It's a tough call. He's standing up for what he believes is right for his child, but the ultimatum of divorce is strong. It depends on whether the wife is actively going against their agreement or if she's being influenced. If she's complicit in allowing her father to do this without the husband's consent, then maybe the husband is justified. But if she's being pressured and trying to maintain some balance, the husband's response could be seen as harsh. \n\nIn terms of ethics, forcing a divorce over a disagreement on religious upbringing is a big step. It's possible the husband is overreacting, especially if the wife isn't fully supportive of her father's actions but is allowing them due to pressure. The husband's approach might be seen as not giving the wife the space to handle her family dynamics while also respecting his boundaries. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is a bit of both, but since the choice is between A and B, I need to pick. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, so maybe the reasoning is that threatening divorce is extreme. But if the wife is not respecting their original agreement by allowing her father to do this, then the husband isn't in the wrong. However, maybe the wife is complicit, so the husband's actions are justified. \n\nBut the key point is the wife agreed to secular upbringing, but then allowed her father to take the child. If she's not on board with her father's actions, then the husband might have a valid point. If she is, then maybe she's in the wrong. Since the scenario says she \"continued to put on a front for her Muslim father\" and \"her family does not like me,\" it's possible she's being insincere in her commitment to secular upbringing. The husband found out her father took the son without consent, which is a breach of their agreement. \n\nSo, the husband is taking a stand to protect his child's upbringing as per their agreement. The wife might be reverting to her family's influence, so the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong). But I need to be careful here. In some contexts, threatening divorce over this might be seen as harsh, but if the child's upbringing is a core value, then it's a valid decision. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I'm leaning towards B.\n"
