She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife if she continues to raise their son as Muslim, despite their prior agreement. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The couple married two years ago, both initially secular. The husband is an atheist, the wife was agnostic but started attending the mosque for her father. The father-in-law dislikes the husband's background but wants the son raised Muslim. The husband refuses, leading to conflict.\n\nThe key points here are their agreement on secular upbringing, the father-in-law's unauthorized actions, and the husband's ultimatum. The husband is acting to protect his son's upbringing, which is a valid parental concern. However, threatening divorce over this might be seen as extreme, especially if the wife is also involved, albeit under pressure from her family.\n\nBut the wife agreed to the secular upbringing. If she's allowing her father to influence the child against her husband's wishes, that could breach the earlier agreement. The husband's stance is about upholding what they agreed on. However, using divorce as a threat might be seen as harsh, especially if the wife is conflicted and not acting independently.\n\nAlso, the husband is respecting the wife's autonomy but draws the line at their child. It's a complex situation with cultural and familial pressures. The husband's actions are about enforcing their mutual agreement, while the wife might feel torn between her family and her marriage.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical perspectives, parents generally have equal rights in child-rearing. If one parent is undermining the other's wishes without consent, it's a problem. The husband's approach is confrontational, but given the circumstances, he's trying to protect his child's upbringing. However, divorce as a threat might not be the healthiest approach, even if the underlying issue is valid.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might hinge on whether threatening divorce is an appropriate response to a breach of their agreement. The husband's actions are driven by protecting their child's upbringing, but the ultimatum could be problematic. However, since the wife's father is involved without consent, the husband's stance might be justified.\n"
