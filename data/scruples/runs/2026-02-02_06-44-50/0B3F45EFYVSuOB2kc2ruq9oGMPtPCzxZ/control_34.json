She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife over how their son is being raised as Muslim. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple is married two years, with the wife from an immigrant family that's fundamentalist Muslim. The author is atheist, and they agreed to raise their kids secular. The wife's family doesn't like him because he's white and from a Christian background. Now, the wife's father took their son to the mosque without consent, which the author objects to. The author says he'll divorce her if she continues to try to raise the son as Muslim.\n\nSo, the main issue here is parental authority and religious upbringing. The author is concerned about his son being exposed to religion against his wishes. The wife might feel caught between her family's expectations and her husband's. The father-in-law's actions are a problem because he's influencing the child without the father's consent.\n\nIn many places, parents have the right to raise their children according to their beliefs, but there are also laws about child welfare. However, the father-in-law isn't a legal parent, so his involvement without consent might be an issue. The husband is asserting his right to co-parent and set boundaries.\n\nBut is threatening divorce over this a wrong move? Well, the husband has a right to protect his child's upbringing as per their agreement. However, threatening divorce because of disagreements on child-rearing is a big step. The wife might feel pressured and that her cultural background is being dismissed. It's possible that the husband is overstepping by making it a deal-breaker for their marriage, especially if the wife is trying to navigate her family's pressure and her own beliefs.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the wife's autonomy. The husband says she's an adult and can do what she wants, but then uses divorce as a threat when she's acting on her own choices. That might be conflicting. The father-in-law's actions are problematic, but the wife's role in allowing or not allowing contact with him could be a point of contention.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author is using the threat of divorce to enforce a strict boundary on religious upbringing, which is a significant issue. However, it's important to consider both sides: the right to raise children without unwanted religious influence versus respecting the wife's background and the husband's legitimate concerns. The answer might depend on cultural context and how the situation is handled in terms of family mediation or legal aspects. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong, so based on the information given, without legal specifics, the husband's stance is about enforcing his boundaries, which he's entitled to, but the method of using divorce as a threat might be seen as harsh. However, given the circumstances, he's standing up for his family's secular upbringing. So maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
