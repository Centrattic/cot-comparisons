She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife over religious upbringing issues. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and his wife are married for two years. She comes from a fundamentalist Muslim family, and he's an atheist. They agreed to raise their kids secularly. The wife was agnostic before marriage but now seems to be leaning into her faith, especially under family pressure. The father-in-law took the baby to the mosque without their consent, which the author found out later. The author is upset because he doesn't want his son raised Muslim, and he's told his wife that if she continues, he'll divorce her.\n\nSo, the main conflict is about the child's religious upbringing. The author's stance is about autonomy over his son's upbringing, while the wife is influenced by her family. The in-law's actions (taking the child without consent) are a big issue here. The author feels that his input as a parent is being ignored, and the wife isn't protecting their child's secular upbringing as they agreed.\n\nNow, considering the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, both parents have equal rights in raising their children, but when there's a conflict, especially involving religious practices, it can get complicated. However, the father-in-law's actions might be a separate issue. The wife might be under pressure from her family, which is affecting her decisions. The author is frustrated because his wife isn't standing up to her family, despite their agreement.\n\nThe author is threatening divorce, which is a serious matter. But is he in the wrong? Well, he's asserting his right to raise the child as he sees fit, which is valid. However, he's making a threat to end the marriage if his wife doesn't comply with his wishes. That could be problematic because it's putting pressure on her to choose between her family and her husband, especially when she's under her family's control.\n\nThe wife's mental health is also mentioned\u2014she becomes depressed and ashamed around her father. The author might not be considering how his ultimatum affects their relationship and her autonomy. If the wife wants to maintain her connection with her family and practice her religion, but the author is against it, forcing a divorce might not be the right approach. They might need counseling or mediation to find a middle ground.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has a right to be involved in his son's upbringing. The father-in-law's unauthorized actions are a breach of trust and could be legally actionable depending on the jurisdiction. The author's stance on not wanting religious imposition is his right, but the way he's handling it by threatening divorce might be too harsh, especially if there's a possibility of resolution through communication or legal means.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to protect his son's upbringing, but his approach of threatening divorce without trying to resolve the issue collaboratively might be the problem. The answer probably hinges on whether the threat is justified given the circumstances. Since he's standing up for his rights as a parent, he's not in the wrong, but the method could be questionable. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for the situation. Given the father-in-law's actions and the initial agreement, the author's position seems valid. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
