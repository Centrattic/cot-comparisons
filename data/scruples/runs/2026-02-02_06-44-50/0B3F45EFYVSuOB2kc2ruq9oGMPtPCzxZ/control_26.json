She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple with a baby, where the husband is atheist and the wife is from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They had agreed to raise their kids secularly, but now the wife's father is taking their son to the mosque without the husband's knowledge.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple had an agreement before having kids. The husband made it clear he didn't want the son raised as Muslim. The wife initially agreed. But now, her father is interfering, and the wife is possibly not stopping it. The husband threatens divorce if this continues.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The husband is standing by his original agreement. He's protecting his child from religious teachings he doesn't support. The wife's family is pressuring her, which is causing her emotional distress. The father-in-law is acting against the husband's wishes, which he finds unacceptable. The husband is asserting his right to make decisions about his child's upbringing, which is a big deal since the child is very young.\n\nBut maybe the husband's approach is too harsh? He's threatening divorce over this. The wife might be caught between her family's expectations and her marriage. She might be struggling with her own beliefs now. If she's not forcing the religion on the child herself, but her family is, the husband's problem is with the grandmother or father-in-law. However, if the wife isn't stopping this, maybe she's complicit. But the husband might not have control over her family's actions.\n\nIn some places, parents have the right to make decisions about their child's upbringing. If the husband is the legal parent, he might have the right to object to religious instruction. However, the wife's family taking the child without permission could be a legal issue. The husband's right to make decisions about the child's religion is something to consider. \n\nBut the threat of divorce is a big deal. Maybe he should try legal means first, like custody arrangements, rather than threatening to leave his wife. However, if the wife is not supporting his position and is allowing her family to influence the child, he might feel justified in leaving. \n\nThe wife might be in a difficult position, pressured by her family. The husband is standing by his original agreement, which the wife agreed to. If she's not fulfilling her part, maybe he's right to take a stand. However, the way he's handling it\u2014threatening divorce\u2014could be seen as extreme. \n\nIn some cultures, religion is a big part of family life, and the wife might feel torn. The husband is trying to protect his child's autonomy in terms of religion. The core issue is mutual respect and the agreement they made. If the wife is not upholding her part, the husband might feel justified. \n\nBut maybe the husband isn't considering the wife's perspective. She might feel isolated, and the husband's threat could push her further away. However, the father's right to protect his child from unwanted religious influence is a strong point. \n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, the husband is acting in his belief of the child's best interest. The wife might need to address her family's involvement, but if she's not doing that, the husband's stance is defensible. \n\nSo, considering all this, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's enforcing an agreement and protecting his child from unwanted religious influence. The wife's family's actions are problematic, and the husband is taking a stand. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
