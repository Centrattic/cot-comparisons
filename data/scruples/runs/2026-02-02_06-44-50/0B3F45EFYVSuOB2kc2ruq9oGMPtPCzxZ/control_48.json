She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, an atheist, threatening to divorce his wife if she continues to raise their son as Muslim. The wife comes from a fundamentalist Muslim immigrant family, and there's tension because her family doesn't approve of the author. The father-in-law has taken the son to the mosque without permission.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, both parents have equal rights in raising their children. The author is an atheist and wants the child to be raised secular, while the wife is Muslim. The father-in-law's actions of taking the child to the mosque without consent could be a problem. The author's threat of divorce if the wife continues to raise the child as Muslim is a key point.\n\nLegally, unless there's abuse or neglect, parents can't unilaterally decide the other parent's religious upbringing choices. So if the wife is acting within her rights as a parent, the author's threat could be seen as overstepping. However, the father-in-law's involvement without permission is another issue. The author might be justified in objecting to the grandfather's actions, but using divorce as a threat over the wife's choices complicates things.\n\nEthically, it's about mutual respect and communication. If the wife agreed to secular upbringing initially, changing her stance could be a problem. But maybe she's under pressure from her family. The author's concern for his child's upbringing is valid, but how he's handling it\u2014threatening divorce\u2014might not be the best approach. It depends on whether the wife is violating their prior agreement or if the father-in-law's actions are the main issue.\n\nThe wife seems to be caught between her family and her husband. She's happy in her home but pressured by her father. If she's complying with her family against her husband's wishes, that's a conflict. However, the author's solution is to end the marriage, which is a drastic step. It's possible he's in the right if the wife is breaking their agreement, but if she's struggling with her family's influence, it's a different scenario.\n\nI need to check if the author's actions are legally permissible. In some jurisdictions, one parent can't prevent the other from exposing the child to their religion unless it's harmful. So if the wife is practicing her faith with the child, even against the other parent's wishes, it might not be illegal. The author's threat to divorce might be a personal choice, but it could be seen as using marriage as a bargaining tool, which is ethically questionable.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's stance on the upbringing is his right, but threatening divorce over differences in child-rearing is a complex issue. The father-in-law's unauthorized involvement adds another layer. If the wife is acting independently, the author's threat might be in the wrong. If she's being coerced, maybe not. But generally, using divorce as leverage over disagreements about child-rearing could be seen as extreme.\n"
