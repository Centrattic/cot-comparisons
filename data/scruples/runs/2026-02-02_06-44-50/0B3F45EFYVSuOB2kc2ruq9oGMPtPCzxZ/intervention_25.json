She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling his wife he'll divorce her if she continues to raise their son as Muslim.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is an atheist, and the wife was initially agnostic but comes from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They agreed to raise their kids secular, and the author didn't want the religion imposed on their children. The wife agreed to that. However, the father-in-law is pressuring the wife and even taking the son to the mosque without the author's consent, which is a breach of the agreed-upon arrangement.\n\nThe author feels that his rights as a father are being violated. He's not just upset about the religion but about the father-in-law's control over the wife and the child. He's trying to protect his son from being raised in a way that goes against his beliefs. But when he tells the wife he'll divorce her if she continues, that's a strong ultimatum. \n\nOn one hand, the author is standing up for his values and the child's upbringing. On the other hand, the wife might feel that she's being forced into a choice between her husband and her family. The key issue here is whether the author's threat of divorce is a justified response to protect his son's upbringing or if it's an overreaction that undermines his wife's autonomy.\n\nThe wife might be caught in a bind. She was supposed to raise the child secularly, but her family's influence is pushing her towards Islam. The author's ultimatum could add pressure on her to choose between her husband's demands and her family's expectations. If the wife is not in agreement with the father-in-law's actions but still wants to practice her faith, the author's response might not consider her own beliefs and her right to express them, even if it conflicts with his.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that he respects the wife's autonomy as an adult, but the ultimatum seems to remove her agency in the situation. By saying he'll divorce her if she doesn't stop, he's essentially making her the enemy in this conflict, rather than addressing the father-in-law's actions directly. The real problem is the father-in-law's interference, not necessarily the wife's actions if she's being pressured by her family.\n\nFurthermore, the author's approach might not be the healthiest way to resolve the issue. Instead of threatening divorce, maybe working together to set boundaries with the father-in-law, seeking counseling, or finding a compromise would be more constructive. The ultimatum could lead to a breakdown in the marriage without addressing the underlying issues of the wife's family's influence and the author's concerns about his son's upbringing.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's concern for his son's upbringing is valid, the method he's using\u2014threatening divorce\u2014might not be appropriate. It could be seen as an overreaction that doesn't take into account the wife's position and the complexity of the situation. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not finding a more collaborative solution and instead resorting to an ultimatum.\n"
