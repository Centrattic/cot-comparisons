She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong after threatening to divorce his wife over her continuing to expose their son to Islam. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the key points: The husband is an atheist, the wife converted to Islam but was previously agnostic. They agreed to raise their children secularly. However, the wife's family is very religious, and they're pressuring her. The husband found out the father-in-law took their son to the mosque without permission. The husband is upset because he doesn't want the child raised as Muslim and is considering divorce if the wife continues to allow this.\n\nNow, legal aspects might vary by country, but assuming this is a common law scenario where both parents have equal rights. The husband has a right to his religious beliefs and wants the child raised secularly. The wife's family's actions are against his wishes, and she's allowing it, which he sees as a betrayal.\n\nBut wait, the wife is an adult and might have her own beliefs evolving. She might be influenced by her family, which could be a point of contention. However, the father-in-law's unauthorized actions with the child (taking him to mosque without consent) might be a legal issue. The husband has a right to object to the child being raised in a religion against his wishes, especially since they had an agreement.\n\nThe husband's threat of divorce is based on the breach of their agreement and the unauthorized actions of the father-in-law. The wife's compliance (whether she's actively choosing to go along or is being pressured) is important. If she's willingly allowing the father-in-law to influence the child against the husband's wishes, then the husband's stance is about protecting his child's upbringing. However, if the wife is being coerced, that complicates things.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the husband is standing up for his beliefs and the agreed-upon parenting plan. The wife's actions (or inaction) might be the issue here. However, threatening divorce over this could be seen as extreme, but given the context of the child's upbringing, which is a fundamental right, it's a complex situation.\n\nLegally, in many places, both parents have equal rights to raise the child, so the husband's stance is valid. The wife's continued actions against the agreed plan might be the problem. The father-in-law's actions could be considered parental alienation or illegal if not approved by the other parent.\n\nThe husband's main issue is the child's religious upbringing, which is a significant aspect of parenting. If the wife is not respecting the agreed-upon terms, the husband is within his rights to seek resolution, including divorce if mediation fails. So, the answer would lean towards B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
