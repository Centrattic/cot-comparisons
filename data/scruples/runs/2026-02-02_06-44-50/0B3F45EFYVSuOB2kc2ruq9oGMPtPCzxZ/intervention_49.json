She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple with conflicting views on raising their child. The husband is an atheist, and the wife comes from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They had agreed to raise their son secularly, but the wife's father is taking the child to the mosque without the husband's knowledge.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple had an agreement about secular upbringing. The father-in-law is acting without the husband's consent, which the husband strongly opposes. The wife might be influenced by her family's pressure despite their prior agreement. The husband's main issue is that the father-in-law is interfering in the upbringing of the child against his wishes. \n\nThe husband is asserting his right to have a say in his child's upbringing, which is understandable. However, threatening divorce over this issue might be seen as extreme. But given the situation, maybe he's justified in standing his ground. The father-in-law's actions are a problem here, but the wife's role is also important. If she's not preventing her father's actions, that could be a point of contention. The husband is trying to protect his son from what he sees as unwanted religious influence. \n\nBut is threatening divorce the right approach? It's a drastic measure, but if there's an agreement that can't be upheld, then maybe it's a last resort. The wife might be caught between her family and her husband, and the husband's ultimatum could be seen as a way to enforce their original agreement. However, using divorce as a threat might be seen as inflexible. \n\nOn the other hand, the father-in-law's actions are unauthorized, and the husband has a right to be involved in his child's upbringing. The wife's compliance or inaction could be part of the problem. The husband's stance is about respecting his values as a parent. So, is he in the wrong? It depends on whether the threat of divorce is proportional. Since they had an agreement, and the wife isn't stopping the interference, the husband's response might be justified. But maybe there's a way to address it without divorce. \n\nAlternatively, if the wife is being pressured by her family and isn't standing up for her agreement, she might share some responsibility. But the question is about the husband. The key is whether threatening divorce over this issue is reasonable. Given the circumstances, it's a difficult situation, but if the agreement is being violated and the other parent isn't acting, then the husband's stance might be justified. So maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong. But I need to be careful about the nuances. The father-in-law's actions are a problem, but the husband is standing up for his rights as a parent. The threat is a means to enforce the agreement. So, likely B.\n"
