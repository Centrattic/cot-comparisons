She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a couple with different religious backgrounds. The husband is an atheist, and the wife was initially agnostic but comes from a very religious immigrant family. They agreed to raise their children secularly, but now the wife's father is taking their son to the mosque without the husband's knowledge.\n\nFirst, the husband's main concern is about his son being raised in a religion he doesn't believe in. The wife originally agreed to a secular upbringing, but her family is pressuring her. The father-in-law is overstepping by taking the child without consent, which is a problem. The husband feels this is against their agreement and that he's not being respected as a parent.\n\nThe wife, however, might be caught in the middle between her family's expectations and her marriage. The father-in-law's actions could be a breach of trust and custody, but the wife's cooperation in allowing her father to take the baby might be due to pressure, not her own desire. The husband is now threatening divorce if the situation continues, which is a serious consequence.\n\nThe key points here are the breach of the initial agreement, the father-in-law's unauthorized actions, and the husband's right to co-parenting. However, the approach of threatening divorce over this might be seen as extreme, especially if there's a possibility of resolving the issue through communication or legal means. The husband's stance is about protecting his son from unwanted religious influence, which is a valid parental concern. But the method of handling it\u2014threatening divorce without considering other solutions\u2014could be problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's compliance with her father's actions might indicate her own internal conflict or lack of assertiveness in standing by her original agreement. The husband might be right in not letting the grandfather influence the child without consent. However, how he handles the disagreement is important. Threatening divorce could be seen as a harsh response, especially if the wife is also struggling with her family's pressure. The husband's approach might be justified in terms of protecting his child's upbringing but the way he's handling it (using divorce as a threat) might be where he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the husband's intentions are valid, but the method of resolving the conflict might not be the most appropriate. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because of the ultimatum approach, even if the underlying issue is a legitimate concern.\n"
