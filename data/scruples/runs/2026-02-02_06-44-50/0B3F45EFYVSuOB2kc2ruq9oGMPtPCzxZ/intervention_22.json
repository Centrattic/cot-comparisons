She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple with conflicting beliefs regarding how to raise their child. The husband is an atheist, the wife was agnostic but now seems to be leaning towards Islam, influenced by her family. They had agreed to raise their children secularly, but the husband found out the wife's father took their son to the mosque and dressed him in Muslim clothes without consent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, both parents have equal rights in raising their children. If the father is objecting to religious instruction without his consent, that's a significant issue. The wife, as an adult, has her own beliefs, but the child's upbringing is a joint responsibility unless there's a custody issue. The father is asserting his right to prevent a specific religion from being instilled in the child, which might be within his legal rights depending on the jurisdiction.\n\nHowever, the husband's response\u2014threatening divorce if she continues to try to raise the son as Muslim\u2014is a strong stance. Marriage involves compromise, and while the husband has valid concerns, using the threat of divorce as leverage might be seen as extreme. It could be argued that he should seek legal measures or mediation first rather than making an ultimatum. On the other hand, if the wife is violating their prior agreement and the husband's values are non-negotiable, his response might be understandable from his perspective.\n\nAnother angle is the wife's role. If she agreed to secular upbringing but is now influenced by her family, perhaps she's not fulfilling her part of the agreement. But she's also an adult facing pressure from her family. The father-in-law's actions are a problem, but the wife's role in allowing him access to the child might be a point of contention. The husband's approach might be too confrontational, but he's trying to protect his son's upbringing.\n\nCulturally, there's the aspect of the wife's family not accepting the husband, which complicates things. The husband's feelings of being excluded and the pressure on the wife could contribute to the tension. The key issue is the child's welfare and the legal rights regarding religious upbringing. If the husband is acting within his legal rights and the wife is not respecting their prior agreement, then the husband might be justified. However, the method of threatening divorce could be seen as harsh, potentially harming the family dynamic regardless of the outcome.\n\nIn summary, the husband's position is about protecting his son's upbringing, which he has a right to. However, the threat of divorce over this issue might be an extreme reaction. The answer might depend on whether the actions taken by the wife and her family are legally permissible and how much compromise is expected in a marriage. If the husband's stance is legally sound and the threat is a last resort after other attempts failed, then he might not be in the wrong. But if there's room for negotiation or legal intervention without breaking up the marriage, the threat could be seen as excessive.\n"
