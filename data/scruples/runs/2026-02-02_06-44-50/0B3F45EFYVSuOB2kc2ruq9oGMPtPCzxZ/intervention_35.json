She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for threatening divorce over his wife continuing to raise their son as Muslim. The author is an atheist, and they agreed to raise their children secularly. The wife comes from a Muslim family, and the father-in-law is pressuring to involve the son in Muslim practices. The author found out the father took the son to the mosque without permission and decided to divorce if this continues.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author's stance is about child-rearing and religious upbringing. He believes that the son should be raised secularly, as agreed, and is upset that the father-in-law is influencing the child against his wishes. He feels that the wife isn't standing up to her family, leading him to threaten divorce.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's family is part of her background, and she might feel torn between her husband's wishes and her family's expectations. She might be trying to maintain her cultural identity while also respecting her husband's secular views. The fact that she's happy at home but comes back depressed after seeing her father suggests she's conflicted.\n\nNow, the author's main issue is the unauthorized actions of the father-in-law. He sees it as a violation of their agreement and a threat to his son's upbringing. His response is to threaten divorce if the situation continues. Is that justified? Well, parental rights and child-rearing decisions are significant. Both parents have a say, especially once the child is born. If the wife is agreeing to let her father influence their son, that could be a problem. But maybe she's under pressure and not acting out of her own volition.\n\nHowever, the author's approach of threatening divorce is a drastic step. It's important to consider if communication and seeking mediation could resolve the conflict without breaking the marriage. Also, the father-in-law's actions might be seen as overstepping, but the wife's role here is key. If the wife is complicit or not standing up for her husband's wishes, that's an issue. Alternatively, she might be struggling with her own identity and family pressures.\n\nLegally, in many places, both parents have equal rights in child-rearing, so the father-in-law shouldn't be making unilateral decisions. The author's refusal to allow the father-in-law to influence the child could be seen as protecting his right as a parent. But the way he's handling it by threatening divorce might be too harsh, especially if there's a possibility of resolution through discussion or legal means.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but I need to weigh if that's accurate. The author's main issue is the violation of their agreed-upon secular upbringing. If the wife is not honoring that agreement by allowing the father-in-law to influence their son, then the author has a legitimate concern. However, the threat of divorce is a serious consequence. Perhaps there are other steps they could take, like setting boundaries with the father-in-law, legal discussions, or counseling.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's position is about protecting his child's upbringing, the method of addressing it through divorce might be extreme. The situation is complex, involving cultural and familial pressures. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to protect his child's upbringing, but his approach could be improved. On the other hand, the wife's role in this is also important\u2014if she's not asserting her husband's wishes to her family, that's a separate issue. Overall, the answer might hinge on whether threatening divorce is an appropriate response to a disagreement over child-rearing.\n"
