She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The situation is that the author is married to a woman from an immigrant Muslim family, and he's an atheist. They agreed their kids would be raised secular. Now, the wife's father is taking their son to the mosque without permission and dressing him in Muslim clothes. The author is threatening divorce if this continues.\n\nFirst, the main issue is about the upbringing of their child. The couple had an agreement before having kids, so the author's stance is about honoring that agreement. The father-in-law is pressuring them, which is causing tension. The author feels that his son is being influenced against his wishes. \n\nI should consider the legal aspects. In many places, both parents have equal rights in raising their child unless there's a court order. If the father-in-law is taking the child without permission, that might be a legal issue. But the wife is the mother, so she's the one who's allowing or not allowing this. The author is upset because he thinks she's going against their agreement.\n\nThe wife's situation is tricky. She might be under pressure from her family, which is a common issue in intercultural or interfaith marriages. She might feel torn between her husband and her family. The author is frustrated because she's not stopping her father from interfering. The author's threat of divorce is a strong response, but maybe he's justified if he feels his wishes are being ignored regarding their child.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's standing up for his beliefs and the agreement they had. However, threatening divorce is a serious step. But given that the child's upbringing is a fundamental issue, and the father-in-law's actions are against his wishes, maybe it's understandable. The wife's compliance with her father's actions could be seen as breaking their agreement, so the author isn't wrong to be upset. On the other hand, maybe the author should have tried to resolve this with the wife first rather than threatening divorce immediately. But the problem is ongoing, and the father-in-law isn't listening. \n\nConsidering all that, the author might not be in the wrong because he's asserting his right to raise his child without interference, especially when there was a prior agreement. The father-in-law's actions are problematic, and the author is trying to protect his son's upbringing. So the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
