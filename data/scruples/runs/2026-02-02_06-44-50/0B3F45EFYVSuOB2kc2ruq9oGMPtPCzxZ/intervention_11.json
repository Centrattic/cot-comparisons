She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband and wife with conflicting views on raising their son's religion. The husband is an atheist, and they originally agreed to raise their kids secular. The wife comes from a fundamentalist Muslim family who are pressuring her to involve the son in their religion. The father finds out that the wife's father took the son to the mosque without permission and decides to threaten divorce if she continues.\n\nFirst, the husband's position is that he doesn't want the child raised as Muslim. He feels the father-in-law is overstepping. The wife, however, might be caught between her family's expectations and her marriage. The key points here are the initial agreement between the couple about secular upbringing. If they had agreed before the child was born, then he's standing up to his part. But if the wife is now being pressured by her family, maybe she's trying to maintain her relationship with them.\n\nThe husband's response is to threaten divorce if she continues. That's a strong reaction. The father-in-law's actions are problematic, but the wife might be complicit by allowing the visits. However, the husband's ultimatum could be seen as extreme. Divorce over this issue might be considered a harsh measure, especially since the wife might not be fully in agreement with her father's actions. Also, the husband is not allowing the wife to reconcile her family ties with her marriage, which could lead to more conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is trying to honor his original agreement with his wife. If she's going against that agreement by letting her father influence the child, he has a right to be upset. But threatening divorce each time she does something he doesn't agree with might be overreacting. Maybe there's a middle ground, like seeking counseling or setting clearer boundaries with the father-in-law.\n\nThe wife's happiness when they are together but depression when with her father suggests she's conflicted. She might be trying to balance her family's expectations with her husband's wishes. If she's not actively participating in the religious upbringing but allowing her father to, maybe she feels trapped. The husband should consider that and try to communicate better rather than threatening divorce.\n\nIn terms of legal aspects, in some places, both parents have rights in child-rearing, but since the husband is the father, he has a say. However, the wife might have her own rights as well. The situation is complex. The husband's stance is about protecting his child's upbringing, but the method (threatening divorce) is extreme. So, the question is whether his reaction is justified.\n\nI think the husband is in the wrong because while his concerns are valid, threatening divorce over this without addressing the underlying issues and without considering his wife's position is too harsh. He should work with her to find a solution rather than using an ultimatum. So the answer might be A, but I need to make sure.\n"
