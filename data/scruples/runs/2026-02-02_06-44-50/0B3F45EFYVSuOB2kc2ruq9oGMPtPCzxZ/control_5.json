She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple with differing religious beliefs and their child's upbringing. The husband is an atheist, and the wife was agnostic but now seems to be leaning towards Islam, influenced by her fundamentalist Muslim family. They had agreed on a secular upbringing for their child. The conflict arises when the wife's father takes their son to the mosque without the husband's consent, leading the husband to threaten divorce if the wife continues to raise the child as Muslim.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, both parents have equal rights in raising their children. The husband is concerned about religious indoctrination and the father-in-law's influence. However, the wife is also a parent, and she might have her own reasons for wanting to involve her son in her religion, which she might believe is part of his heritage. The key issue is whether the husband's threat of divorce is justified given the circumstances.\n\nThe husband's stance is about protecting his child from what he sees as unwanted religious influence. The wife, on the other hand, might feel her cultural and familial ties are important. The father-in-law's actions\u2014taking the child without permission and trying to influence the child's religion\u2014could be problematic, but the wife's continued cooperation with her family might also be an issue. \n\nThe husband is asserting his right as a parent to have a say in his child's upbringing. However, threatening divorce over this seems extreme, especially since the wife might not be directly responsible for her father's actions. It's possible that the wife is caught between her husband and her family, and the husband's ultimatum could be pressuring her into a difficult position.\n\nLegally, if the husband can prove that his wife is allowing the father-in-law to influence the child against his wishes, there might be grounds for a custody issue. But in terms of marital rights, threatening divorce over a disagreement in parenting styles, especially when both parents have their own valid perspectives, might be seen as harsh. The husband's actions could be seen as protecting his child's secular upbringing, but the method (threatening divorce) is a severe response.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's family's actions\u2014taking the child without consent and imposing religious practices\u2014could be considered overstepping. The husband has a right to be involved in decisions regarding his child's upbringing. However, the solution of threatening divorce might not be the appropriate way to handle this conflict. It's possible that communication issues or a lack of mediation are contributing to the problem.\n\nIn summary, while the husband has valid concerns about his child's upbringing and the influence of his in-laws, threatening divorce over this without seeking other solutions (like legal intervention or counseling) might be the wrong approach. The wife's agency as an adult is also a factor; she should be able to make decisions for her child, but the husband's right to co-parent cannot be ignored. The situation is complex, and the threat of divorce might not be justified given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong, but the situation is nuanced. However, considering the options given (A or B), the answer is likely B (No).\n"
