She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife over her religious upbringing of their son. The situation involves the author being an atheist and the wife, who's from a fundamentalist Muslim immigrant family, possibly not as committed to her religion as before. They agreed to raise their children secularly, but the wife's father is taking the son to the mosque without the author's knowledge.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple had an agreement about secular upbringing. The wife's family is pressuring her, and the father-in-law is acting against the author's wishes. The author feels that the religious influence is being forced on the child. The wife might be conflicted due to family pressure.\n\nThe author's main issue is that his wife is allowing her father to influence their son, which he didn't consent to. He's standing by his original agreement and is using the threat of divorce to enforce it. But is this the right approach? Divorce is a significant step. Maybe there's a way to address the issue without breaking up the marriage. However, if the wife is not adhering to their agreement, the author has a right to be concerned about his child's upbringing.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's approach is confrontational. He's not engaging with his wife to resolve the conflict but instead threatening divorce. That could be seen as extreme. The wife might feel trapped between her family and her husband, and the author's ultimatum could push her further into her family's influence or cause more marital strain.\n\nBut then again, the author is protecting his child from religious indoctrination against his wishes. The father-in-law's actions are unauthorized, which is a breach of trust. The author has a right to be involved in his child's upbringing and to object to unsupervised religious exposure.\n\nThe question is whether the author's response is proportionate. While the threat to divorce is harsh, it's based on a fundamental disagreement over their child's upbringing, which is a critical issue. However, there might be other avenues to resolve this, like mediation or legal steps to clarify custody and upbringing rights. The author's actions might be justified if the wife is not respecting their agreement and the father-in-law is overstepping.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, parents have the right to make decisions about their child's upbringing. If one parent is going against the other's religious wishes, legal intervention might be necessary. The author's stance could be seen as protecting his parental rights, but the method of using divorce as an ultimatum is contentious.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might not be in the wrong if he's standing up for his beliefs and the child's upbringing, but his approach is extreme. However, since the other parent is violating the agreement, he has valid concerns. It's a tough call between respecting the wife's autonomy and protecting the child's upbringing against unwanted influence. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because he's enforcing their prior agreement and protecting his child's upbringing, even if the method is harsh.\n"
