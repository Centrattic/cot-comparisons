She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is an atheist, and his wife is from an immigrant Muslim family. They agreed to raise their children secular, but now the wife's father is taking their son to a mosque without the author's knowledge. The author is threatening divorce if the wife continues to allow this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple had an agreement about their children's upbringing. The wife might be under pressure from her family, which is causing conflict. The father-in-law is acting against the author's wishes, which is a problem because the son is both their child. The author feels that his religious beliefs are being imposed on his son, which he's not okay with. \n\nNow, the author is threatening divorce over this. Is that justified? Well, if they had an agreement and the wife is breaking it because of family pressure, maybe the author has a point. But marriage involves compromise. If the wife is going along with her father's actions despite the agreement, that could be an issue. However, the author is not in a position to control the wife's family. The wife might be in a tough spot, trying to please both her husband and her family. \n\nBut the author is the father, so he has a right to be involved in his son's upbringing. The grandfather taking the child without consent is a problem. The author might be justified in wanting to protect his son's upbringing. However, threatening divorce over this could be seen as extreme. Maybe there are other ways to resolve the conflict first, like counseling or legal measures to prevent the grandfather from taking the child. \n\nBut considering that the author is an atheist and the wife's family is pushing religion, it's a matter of parental rights. Both parents have a say in their child's upbringing. If the wife is allowing her father to influence the child against the other parent's wishes, that's a problem. The author's stance is about his son's future, which is a significant issue. However, the threat of divorce just because of this could be seen as harsh if there's no room for negotiation or if the wife isn't at fault entirely. The wife might be struggling with cultural and familial pressures, and the author's response might be too punitive.\n\nAlso, the father-in-law's actions are interfering in the custody, which is a legal matter. The author should probably address this through legal channels rather than threatening divorce. But if the wife is complicit in allowing her father to take the child, that's a separate issue. The author's main concern is valid, but the approach might be too confrontational. \n\nIn summary, the author has valid concerns about his son's upbringing and the interference from his in-laws. However, threatening divorce might be an overreaction if there are other solutions available. The wife might be caught between two worlds, and the author's response could be seen as not fully considering her position. But if the agreement was clear and the wife is violating it, the author is within his rights to be concerned. It's a complex situation where both parties have valid points, but the author's threat of divorce might not be justified if there's potential for resolution without splitting up.\n"
