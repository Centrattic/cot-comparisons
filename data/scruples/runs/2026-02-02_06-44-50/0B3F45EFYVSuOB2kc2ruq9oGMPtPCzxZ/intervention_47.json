She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user provided a detailed situation where the author, a non-religious person, is in a conflict with his wife about raising their son. The wife is from a fundamentalist Muslim family and has started taking the child to the mosque and dressing him in Muslim clothes without the author's knowledge. The author has now told his wife he'll divorce her if she continues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, both parents have the right to make decisions regarding their child's upbringing, but when there's a conflict, it can become complicated. The key points here are the wife's actions without the husband's consent and the father-in-law's involvement. The husband is an atheist and they had an agreement on secular upbringing. The wife initially agreed but then allowed her father to take the child to the mosque. This breach of trust might be a significant issue for the husband.\n\nHowever, the wife is also an adult, and unless there's a legal agreement or custody arrangement, she might have some say in the child's religious upbringing. The father-in-law's actions, taking the child without consent, could be problematic. The husband's threat of divorce is a strong response, but if the wife is actively going against the agreed terms, the husband might feel justified in taking that stance. However, the approach of threatening divorce might be seen as extreme. It's possible that the husband should have tried other means first, like mediation or legal steps, rather than immediately threatening to end the marriage. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel pressured by her family and could be struggling with her own identity, leading her to act in ways that conflict with her original agreement. The husband's concern about the child being \"drilled\" with religion is about protecting his child's upbringing, which is a valid parental concern. But the method of handling it by threatening divorce could be seen as harsh, especially if the wife is already under stress from her family.\n\nThe key here is whether the husband's response is proportionate to the situation. If the wife has broken the agreement and the father-in-law is involved without permission, the husband might have a right to be upset. However, the way he's handling it (threatening divorce) might be seen as extreme. There could be a middle ground, like seeking legal advice to establish parental rights or mediation to resolve the conflict without ending the marriage. \n\nIn terms of the wife's actions, if she's actively taking the child to the mosque against the husband's wishes and without his consent, that could be a breach of their agreement. But if she's being manipulated or pressured by her family, that adds another layer. The husband's threat of divorce could be seen as a last resort if he feels all else has failed. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nConsidering all this, there's a mix of both parties' actions. The wife's actions may have breached an agreement, but the husband's response of immediate divorce threat might be too severe. Legally, in some places, both parents have the right to make decisions, but the father-in-law's involvement complicates things. The husband's primary concern is the child's upbringing, which is valid, but the method of handling it could be questioned. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on cultural context and the specific circumstances. However, based on the information given, the husband is not in the wrong for being protective of his child's upbringing, especially if there was an explicit agreement. The wife's actions are the issue here. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong."
