She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is an atheist who married a woman from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They had agreed to raise their children secularly, but the wife's father is taking their son to the mosque without the author's consent. The author is threatening divorce if this continues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple had an agreement about their children's upbringing. The wife's family is pressuring them, and the father-in-law is acting against the author's wishes, even taking the child to religious services without permission. The author feels that his rights as a parent are being violated because the child is being exposed to religious practices he's against.\n\nThe wife might be caught in the middle. Her family's disapproval of the author could influence her actions. However, she's living with her husband and seems to support a secular upbringing when at home. The issue is that the father-in-law is not respecting the author's boundaries, and the wife might not be doing enough to stop it.\n\nThe author's response is to threaten divorce. Divorce is a serious step. But he's standing up for his beliefs and the agreed-upon parenting plan. He's trying to protect his son from religious indoctrination, which he sees as against their prior agreement. The father-in-law's actions are non-consensual and overstepping, which is a problem.\n\nHowever, the author's approach is to cut off the wife's family access entirely, even if it means ending the marriage. The wife might feel torn between her husband and her family. Is it fair to punish her for her family's actions? The author is also not considering if the wife is being forced by her family or if there's more nuance in her decisions. Maybe there's a lack of communication or understanding between the couple.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to protect his child's upbringing. On the other hand, threatening divorce over this might be extreme if the wife isn't the one directly causing the issue. The father-in-law's actions are the main problem, but the author is directing the threat at his wife, which could be seen as holding her responsible for her father's behavior.\n\nIn terms of parental rights, both parents have a say in their child's upbringing. The author is asserting his right to prevent religious instruction without consent. But the wife's family's involvement complicates things. The author might be in the right in wanting to protect his child's secular upbringing, but his method of addressing the issue (threatening divorce) could be problematic if it's not allowing for other solutions first, like legal steps or mediation.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be in the wrong regarding the principles of parental rights and respecting their prior agreement. However, the way he's handling the conflict could be seen as extreme. The answer might depend on cultural context and legal standards. In some places, parents have the right to make decisions about their children's upbringing without interference from extended family. The father-in-law's unauthorized actions are indeed problematic, so the author's stance is understandable. However, threatening divorce as the immediate solution might not be fair to the wife if she's not fully complicit. But given the circumstances, the author is protecting his own beliefs and the agreed parenting plan. Therefore, the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
