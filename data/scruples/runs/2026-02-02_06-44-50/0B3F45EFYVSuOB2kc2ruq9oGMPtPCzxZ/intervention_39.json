She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a couple with a child where the wife's family is pushing to raise the son as Muslim, but the husband is an atheist and wants a secular upbringing. The husband threatens divorce if the wife continues to let the family do this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, both parents have equal rights in child-rearing, but the husband is making a strong statement here. He's saying he'll divorce her if she doesn't comply with his wishes. But the wife is an adult and might have her own beliefs, even if influenced by her family. The father-in-law's actions\u2014taking the child to the mosque without consent\u2014are a key point. The husband is upset about that, which is understandable, as parental rights are involved.\n\nHowever, the husband's approach seems extreme. Threatening divorce over this disagreement might be seen as using emotional pressure. The wife might feel trapped between her husband's demands and her family's expectations. Also, the husband's claim that she can do what she wants but he won't let her raise the son that way is a bit contradictory. If she's an adult, respecting her autonomy is important, but so is protecting the child from unwanted religious influence.\n\nThe father-in-law's actions are problematic, but the husband's response\u2014threatening divorce\u2014is cutting off communication rather than seeking a compromise. Maybe there are other solutions, like legal measures or counseling. However, the core issue is the child's upbringing, which is a significant decision. The husband has a right to protect his child's upbringing, but the way he's enforcing it could be seen as controlling. The wife's happiness is mentioned, which complicates things further. If she's conflicted, the husband's ultimatum might not be the healthiest approach.\n\nSo, considering all that, the husband's threat of divorce seems like an extreme measure. While his concerns about the child's upbringing are valid, the way he's handling it without trying to find a middle ground might make him at fault. The answer might lean towards A (in the wrong) because of the ultimatum and lack of compromise. But I need to check if there's a legal duty here. In some jurisdictions, parents can't force a child into a religion against the other's wishes. However, the threat of divorce for a disagreement in parenting might be seen as overstepping. So, the author is in the wrong because of the harsh response rather than seeking resolution.\n"
