She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple where the wife is from a Muslim immigrant family, and the husband is an atheist. They agreed to raise their child secularly, but the wife's father is taking their son to the mosque without the husband's knowledge. The husband threatens divorce if the wife continues to allow this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple had an agreement about secular upbringing. The wife's family is pressuring her, and the father-in-law is acting against the husband's wishes. The husband feels that his rights as a father are being violated. The wife is under pressure from her family, which might affect her decisions.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate if the husband's actions are justified. He's enforcing his end of the agreement by threatening divorce, which is a significant step. On one hand, he's protecting his child from what he sees as unwanted religious influence. On the other hand, threatening divorce over the child's upbringing might be extreme, especially if the wife is also involved in these decisions.\n\nThe wife might be caught between her family and her husband. The father-in-law's actions are a problem, but the husband's response could be seen as overreacting. However, parental rights and the upbringing of a child are critical issues. The husband's stance on not wanting his child raised in a specific religion that he opposes is a personal right, but how he enforces it matters.\n\nThe wife's autonomy is also a factor. If the husband is pressuring her to not follow her family's religious practices, that could infringe on her rights as an adult. However, the child's upbringing is a joint responsibility. The husband's threat of divorce for a disagreement on parenting might be seen as an overreach, especially if there's no legal or mutual resolution attempted first.\n\nIn some cultures, family and religious upbringing are very important, which might add complexity. The wife's happiness in their home versus her family's pressure is a delicate balance. The husband's actions could be protecting his child but might also be undermining his wife's autonomy, especially if she's choosing to involve her family despite his objections.\n\nOverall, while the husband has a right to his beliefs, threatening divorce over this specific issue without trying to find a middle ground might be excessive. It's possible that the wife's actions are influenced by her family's pressure, and the husband's response could be seen as not considering her position. The answer hinges on whether the threat of divorce is a proportionate response to the situation.\n"
