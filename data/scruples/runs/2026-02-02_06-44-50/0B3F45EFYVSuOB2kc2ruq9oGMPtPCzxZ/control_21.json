She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a couple with conflicting religious views on raising their child. The husband is an atheist, the wife used to be agnostic but now is being pressured by her fundamentalist Muslim family. They agreed to raise their kids secular, but now the wife's father took the baby to the mosque without the husband's knowledge.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The parents had an agreement, but the wife's family is pressuring. The husband is upset because the father-in-law is imposing religion on the child, which the husband is against. The husband threatens divorce if it continues. The wife seems to support the secular upbringing but is being influenced by her family.\n\nThe question is about whether the author (husband) is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nIn terms of parental rights, both parents have a say in the child's upbringing. However, the wife might not be directly violating the agreement if she's being coerced by her family. The husband is protecting his stance, but maybe he's overstepping if the wife is still aligned with him. However, if the wife is allowing her father to take the child without consent, that's a breach. The husband's threat of divorce is a serious step. The wife's family's actions are problematic, but the wife's role in allowing that could be an issue. \n\nAlso, the wife seems to be in a difficult position between her family and her husband. The husband's main concern is about his son's upbringing against his wishes. The father-in-law's actions are unauthorized. The husband is trying to protect his child's upbringing, so maybe he's in the right. But maybe he should have addressed it with the wife first instead of threatening divorce. \n\nBut the wife already agreed to secular upbringing, so if she's not preventing her father's actions, she might be at fault. The husband is standing by their agreement. However, threatening divorce over this might be extreme. But given the circumstances, he might feel that his values are being violated. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's upholding the agreement they made and trying to prevent his child from being raised against his beliefs. The father-in-law's actions are a breach, and the husband has a right to object. The wife might need to mediate better, but the husband isn't wrong to hold his ground.\n"
