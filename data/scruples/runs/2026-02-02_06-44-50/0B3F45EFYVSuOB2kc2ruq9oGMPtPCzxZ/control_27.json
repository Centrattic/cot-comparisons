She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife over the religious upbringing of their son. \n\nFirst, the author is an atheist, and he and his wife initially agreed that their children would be raised secularly. The wife comes from a fundamentalist Muslim family, but she was agnostic when they married. However, after their son was born, the wife's father took the child to the mosque without the author's consent, which is a key point here. \n\nThe author feels that the father-in-law is exerting too much influence over the child's upbringing against his wishes. He's concerned about his son being exposed to religious practices he disagrees with. He's communicated this to his wife, and she agreed not to let the father see the child, but he found out the father did so anyway. This led him to issue a divorce ultimatum.\n\nNow, considering the legal and ethical aspects. In many jurisdictions, both parents have equal rights in child-rearing decisions. However, if the author is the primary decision-maker, or if there's a mutual agreement, then the wife might be overstepping by not following through on their initial agreement. The father taking the child without consent is a breach of trust and possibly goes against the legal custody terms, depending on the country. \n\nEthically, the author's stance is about protecting his child from religious indoctrination he opposes. On the other hand, the wife might feel her cultural and familial ties are important and that she's trying to balance her heritage with her partner's views. The father-in-law's actions are problematic because he's influencing the child without the author's consent, which is a violation of parental rights.\n\nThe author's response is to threaten divorce if the situation continues. This is a major step, but if the wife is unwilling to respect his boundaries and the father-in-law is interfering, it's a significant conflict. It's not just about religion but about control over the child's upbringing. \n\nHowever, the author might be in the wrong if he's not allowing his wife any autonomy. The wife is an adult and might have her own reasons for keeping her child connected to her culture. The ultimatum could be seen as extreme, especially if there's potential for reconciliation if both parties communicate better. But given the father-in-law's actions and the wife's possible pressure from her family, the author's concerns are valid. \n\nIn terms of parental rights, the author has a right to be involved in the decision-making. The wife's actions in allowing her father to take the child without the author's consent might be the main issue here. The author's response, while harsh, is a reaction to a breach of trust and parental rights. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but the situation is complex. The answer likely leans towards B (Not in the wrong), but it's nuanced. The key points are the father-in-law's unauthorized actions and the initial agreement not being respected.\n"
