She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife if she continues to raise their son as Muslim. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my take.\n\nFirst, the context: The couple married two years ago. The wife is from a fundamentalist Muslim family, but she was agnostic when they met. The author is an atheist. They agreed to raise their kids secular. Now the wife's father is taking their son to the mosque without consent, and the author is upset. He's told his wife he'll divorce her if this continues.\n\nHmm. So the author is threatening divorce over the religious upbringing. The wife's family is pressuring her, and she's conflicted. The father is concerned about his son's religious exposure. The wife might be caught between her family and her husband.\n\nThe key points here are the initial agreement about secular upbringing, the father's right to co-parenting decisions, and the wife's autonomy. The author feels his wishes regarding his child's upbringing are being violated. But he's also making a conditional threat of divorce based on her actions.\n\nOn one hand, parents do have a say in their child's upbringing, especially when it comes to religion. If there was a mutual agreement, and the wife is going against that agreement by allowing her family to influence the child, the author has valid concerns. However, threatening divorce over this is a significant step. Is it reasonable? Maybe if the wife is not respecting his wishes despite agreements, but there's also the aspect of the wife's autonomy. She's an adult and can make her own choices, even if they conflict with her husband's.\n\nThe father-in-law's actions are problematic, but the author's response is directed at the wife. If the wife is being pressured by her family and is perhaps not standing up to them as much as he'd like, is the author overreacting? Or is he justified in protecting his son from religious indoctrination without his consent?\n\nAlso, the wife might be struggling between her husband's wishes and her family's. She might feel trapped. The author's ultimatum could be seen as controlling or not respecting her ability to make her own decisions, even if they're not aligned with his preferences. Marriage involves compromise, but when it comes to children's upbringing, there can be deep conflicts.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's asserting his right to co-parenting decisions, maybe not. But threatening divorce over the wife's choices might be extreme. The wife's autonomy is important. If they had an agreement and she's breaking it, he's within his rights to express that, but using divorce as a threat could be seen as inconsiderate of her position. Maybe there's a middle ground where they can work out a solution without such a drastic measure.\n\nI think it's a bit of both. The author's concern about the child's upbringing is valid, but his approach might be the issue. The wrong here might be in the method rather than the intent. So maybe the answer is that he's not in the wrong (B), but there's nuance. Or maybe he is in the wrong (A) because of the threat of divorce. It's tricky.\n"
