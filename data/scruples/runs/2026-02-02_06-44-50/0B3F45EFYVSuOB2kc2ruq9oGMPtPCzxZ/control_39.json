She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife over her continuing to raise their son as Muslim, despite their prior agreement to raise the child secularly.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is an atheist, his wife was agnostic when they married. They agreed to raise their children secularly. However, after the birth of their son, the wife's Muslim father has been pressuring them to take the child to the mosque, even going so far as taking the baby there without the author's knowledge. The author feels that his wife isn't standing up to her family and is allowing her father to influence their son against his wishes. He's now considering divorce as a result.\n\nSo, the key points here are the conflict over child-rearing decisions, the wife's family's influence, and the author's ultimatum. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for this stance.\n\nI should consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, both parents have equal rights in raising their children, and the father's right to make decisions about the child's upbringing is valid. If the parents had an agreement, the wife might be going against that, which the author is reacting to.\n\nHowever, the wife might feel pressure from her family and perhaps has her own cultural background influencing her actions. The author is taking a firm stance to prevent religious influence on the child, but is threatening divorce a reasonable response? Divorce over this might be seen as extreme if the wife isn't entirely at fault. Maybe she's also trying to balance her heritage with her husband's wishes, but isn't succeeding, leading to conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern is valid if he's not comfortable with the child being exposed to Islam against his wishes. The father's right to make decisions for his child is important. But does the threat of divorce over this matter cross a line? It might depend on whether there's a way to mediate the situation. The author's approach seems confrontational, but if the wife isn't addressing the issue and the father-in-law is non-compliant, the author is trying to protect his son.\n\nI should also think about the wife's perspective. She might be struggling with her cultural identity and her husband's expectations. The fact that her family doesn't like the author because he's white and from a Christian background adds another layer of tension. She might feel torn between her husband and her family's religious expectations.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is standing up for his beliefs and the agreed-upon parenting plan. However, using divorce as a threat over a disagreement in parenting could be seen as extreme. The wife might need to take responsibility if she's not preventing her father's influence, but the author's response might also be harsh if there's room for compromise or better communication.\n\nI think the answer here leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because he's asserting his rights as a parent, but some might argue he's overreacting. However, given the circumstances of the prior agreement and the father-in-law's actions, the author's stance is defensible.\n"
