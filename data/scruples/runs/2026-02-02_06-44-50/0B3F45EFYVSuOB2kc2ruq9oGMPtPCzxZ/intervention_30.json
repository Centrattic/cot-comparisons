She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife if she continues to raise their son as Muslim. The situation involves cultural and religious differences between the couple. The wife comes from a fundamentalist Muslim family, and the husband is an atheist. They agreed to raise their children secular. However, the wife's father is taking the son to the mosque without the husband's consent, leading the husband to make the ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple had an agreement on secular upbringing. The wife's family is pressuring her, and despite her agreement with her husband, she might be influenced by her father. The husband feels his authority as a parent is being undermined, especially since the father-in-law is acting without his consent. The husband is standing by his decision to split up if the situation continues, which is a significant step.\n\nNow, thinking about parental rights and shared responsibility. Both parents have a say in their child's upbringing. If one parent is going against the agreed-upon plan without consulting the other, it's a breach of trust. The husband's frustration is understandable if he feels his wishes are being ignored. However, threatening divorce over this might be seen as extreme. But given that they had an agreement, his stance could be justified as standing up for his beliefs.\n\nAnother angle is the wife's autonomy. She is an adult, and while she's married, she might still have her own cultural ties. The husband's control over her actions could be problematic. However, in this case, the issue is about their child's upbringing, which is a joint decision. If she's violating their agreement, the husband has a right to object.\n\nThe father-in-law's actions are another point. Introducing the child to religion without the other parent's consent might be overstepping. The husband's refusal to let this happen is about protecting his son's upbringing. But the way he's handling it\u2014threatening divorce\u2014could be seen as harsh, especially if the wife is also feeling pressured by her family and might not have full control over her father's actions.\n\nThere's also the aspect of communication. The husband mentions he has told her many times, but she continues. It's possible that the wife is caught between her husband and her family, leading to her depression and shame. The husband might not be considering her position, which is a valid point. But if she's aware and still allowing her father to influence their child, the husband's ultimatum could be seen as a necessary step to protect his values.\n\nIn terms of legal aspects, in many places, both parents have equal rights unless otherwise determined. However, this is about personal values and agreements. The husband is enforcing the initial agreement they made, which is a valid position. But the method\u2014threatening divorce\u2014could be seen as extreme, but given the gravity of the issue (child's upbringing), it might be considered a justified stand.\n\nOverall, while the husband's actions are firm, the core issue is about upholding the initial agreement regarding their child's upbringing. If the wife is not respecting that agreement, the husband has a right to take a strong stance. However, the way he's handling it (threatening divorce) might be seen as harsh, but given the circumstances, it's a matter of differing perspectives on parental rights and cultural pressures.\n"
