She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is an atheist, married to a wife from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They had agreed to raise their kids secular, but now the wife's father is taking their son to the mosque without the author's knowledge. The author is threatening divorce if this continues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author and wife had an agreement about secular upbringing, which the wife might be violating through her family's influence. The author feels his wishes are being ignored, and he's standing up for his values regarding his son's upbringing. The wife's family is pushing religion, which the author opposes. The father-in-law is taking the child without consent, which is a big deal because parental rights are important in most places.\n\nNow, is the author wrong for threatening divorce? Well, in relationships, major disagreements can lead to breaking up, especially when it comes to children. The author's stance is about protecting his son from religious indoctrination against his wishes. But he did agree to marry her knowing her family's beliefs. However, he thought she was agnostic, which might not be the case now. The wife might be influenced by her family, leading to a breach of the original agreement.\n\nThe author's actions are extreme\u2014threatening divorce over this issue. But maybe he's justified because the upbringing of a child is a critical decision. If one parent is going against the agreed-upon plan, especially without the other's consent, it's a serious matter. However, is threatening divorce immediately the right approach? Maybe he should try other methods first, like legal steps or counseling. But given that the father-in-law is interfering, and the wife isn't stopping it, the author feels he has no choice.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might be caught between two worlds. She's living a secular life with her husband but under pressure from her family. The author is holding her accountable, but she might not be the one directly taking the child. The father-in-law's actions are the problem here. The author could be overreacting by blaming the wife and threatening divorce instead of addressing the father-in-law directly.\n\nBut the author's main point is about the child's upbringing. If the child is being exposed to religion without the other parent's consent, that's a legal and ethical issue. In many jurisdictions, both parents have a say in their child's upbringing. If one parent is circumventing the other, that's a problem. The author is trying to protect his rights as a parent. However, the way he's handling it by threatening divorce might be too harsh, but the underlying issue seems valid.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a tough call. His actions are extreme, but the issue is significant. Maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he's asserting his parental rights regarding his child's upbringing. However, some might argue he should have handled it differently. But given the circumstances, he's standing up for his agreed-upon values, so B might be the answer.\n"
