She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user, who is an atheist, married a woman from a fundamentalist Muslim immigrant family. They agreed to raise their children secularly, but now the wife's father is taking their son to the mosque without the user's knowledge. The user has threatened divorce if the wife continues to allow this, even though she's an adult and can make her own choices. He feels the father-in-law is exerting too much control and he can't let his son be raised Muslim. The wife is happy in their home but becomes depressed when around her father.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points. The couple had an agreement about raising their children secularly. The wife's family is pressuring them, and the father-in-law is acting against the user's wishes by taking the baby to the mosque. The user is upset because he feels his parental rights are being ignored. The wife might be conflicted between her family's expectations and her own agreement with her husband.\n\nBut the wife is an adult and can make her own decisions. The user is threatening divorce over this issue. Is that justified? Well, they agreed on secular upbringing, and the wife may be breaking that agreement. However, the user is taking a very strong stance. He's saying he'll divorce her if she continues, even though she's an adult and can choose her own path. But the son is their child, so both parents have a say in their upbringing. If the wife is allowing her father to influence their son against her husband's wishes, that could be a problem.\n\nBut wait, in many places, both parents have equal rights in child-rearing. So if the wife is allowing her father to take the child without the husband's consent, that could be an issue. The user is standing up for his right to have a say in his son's upbringing. On the other hand, the wife might feel pressured by her family and is struggling with that. The user might be overreacting by threatening divorce, but the issue is significant because it's about the child's religious upbringing.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Maybe not, because he is asserting his parental rights and the agreement they had. However, if the wife is an adult and they had an agreement, but she is not following through, maybe the problem is more about communication and conflict resolution rather than immediate divorce. Threatening divorce over this might be extreme, but if the issue is about the child's upbringing, which is a major factor in a marriage, it's understandable. The father-in-law's actions are problematic, and the user is trying to protect his son from being raised in a religion he opposes. So perhaps the user isn't in the wrong. But I need to check if there's any fault on his part. Maybe he could have tried more mediation or discussed with the wife first, but he has already told her multiple times and she's still not stopping. So maybe he's justified in his stance.\n"
