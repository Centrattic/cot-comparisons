She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with differing religious beliefs and a conflict over how their son should be raised.\n\nFirst, the husband is an atheist, and the wife was initially agnostic but now seems to be leaning towards Islam due to her family's influence. They had agreed that their children would be raised secularly. However, the wife's father has taken the child to the mosque without the husband's consent, which the husband finds unacceptable. He threatens divorce if this continues.\n\nFrom the husband's perspective, he's standing up for his beliefs and the agreed-upon parenting plan. He feels his wife is not honoring the agreement, possibly under pressure from her family. He's making a tough decision about divorce to protect his son's upbringing. But is this the right approach?\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might be struggling with her own identity and family expectations. She might feel torn between her husband and her family. The father-in-law's actions could be problematic, but the husband's threat of divorce over this issue could be seen as extreme, especially given the child is an infant. Divorce is a major life decision and using it as leverage might not address the underlying issues, like communication or support for the wife's pressures.\n\nThe husband's stance on raising the child is valid if both parents agreed, but if the wife is now changing her stance and the father-in-law is involved without consent, there's a conflict. However, the husband's solution is to end the marriage, which might not resolve the problem and could harm the wife and child. It's possible he's not considering the wife's position or seeking compromise, like family counseling or legal mediation to address the father-in-law's actions.\n\nAlso, the husband mentions the wife is happy at home but depressed when with her father, indicating her struggle. If the husband is focused on the father-in-law's influence, he might need to involve the wife more in finding a solution rather than threatening divorce. Divorce could leave the wife isolated with the child, especially if the father-in-law is pressuring her, making her situation worse.\n\nIn terms of legal aspects, in many places, both parents have equal rights, and non-consensual religious upbringing might be a point of contention. But the husband's approach here is more about moral stance than legal action. However, threatening divorce over this could be seen as extreme if there's no legal recourse or if it's not in the child's best interest.\n\nSo, considering all angles\u2014the husband's right to an agreement versus the wife's autonomy, the father-in-law's interference, and the impact of divorce on the family\u2014it might be that the husband is overreacting by threatening divorce without addressing the issues through communication or support. Therefore, he could be in the wrong for not seeking other solutions first and for making such a drastic threat.\n"
