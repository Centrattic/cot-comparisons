She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple with conflicting religious beliefs regarding raising their child. The husband is an atheist, and the wife is from a Muslim immigrant family, which is fundamentalist. They had agreed that their children would be raised secularly, but now the wife's father is taking their son to the mosque without the husband's knowledge.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple had an agreement about their child's upbringing. The husband is upset because the wife's family is influencing the child against his wishes. The wife might be caught in the middle between her husband and her family. The husband is threatening divorce if the wife continues to allow her family to influence their son. \n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know the perspective. Let's think about the dynamics here. The husband is trying to protect his child's upbringing according to their agreement. However, his approach is confrontational, threatening divorce. The wife might feel pressured between her husband and her family. The father-in-law's actions are a problem, but is the husband justified in threatening divorce?\n\nThe wife agreed to raise the child secularly, but perhaps she's conflicted due to her family's pressure. The husband's threat might be a reaction to her not upholding the agreement. However, threatening divorce because of disagreements over child-rearing, even if the other spouse is not fully adhering, could be seen as extreme. It's important to consider if there's been any effort to resolve the issue outside of threats, like counseling or communication.\n\nThe husband might have a valid concern about the child's upbringing, but the way he's handling it\u2014flat-out threatening divorce\u2014could be seen as overreacting. The wife's autonomy as an adult is mentioned, but she's also being influenced by her family. The husband's stance on not allowing religious influence might be justified based on their agreement, but the method of enforcement (threatening divorce) could be problematic. \n\nIn terms of legal and ethical aspects, parental rights and shared custody might come into play. However, since the question is about moral wrong, it's more about personal ethics. The husband might be right in wanting to protect his child's upbringing, but the use of divorce as a ultimatum could indicate a lack of compromise or understanding of his wife's position. The wife might be struggling with her own identity and family pressure, which the husband isn't fully considering.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the husband's actions might be seen as extreme, even if his intentions are to protect their child. The threat of divorce over this issue could be viewed as the author being in the wrong because it's a harsh response that doesn't account for the wife's position or seek mutual resolution. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). However, there's a balance here. If the wife is not honoring their agreement, the husband's concern is valid, but the method is questionable. The final call is whether the threat of divorce is justified. Since the user asked if the author is in the wrong, and considering the approach taken, the answer is A.\n"
