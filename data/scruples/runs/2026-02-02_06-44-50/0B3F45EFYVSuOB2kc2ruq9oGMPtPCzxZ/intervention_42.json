She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is an atheist, and his wife, who is from a fundamentalist Muslim immigrant family, was initially agnostic but now seems to be influenced by her family's religion. They had agreed that their children would be raised secularly. The author found out that his father-in-law took their son to the mosque without permission, dressed him in Muslim clothes, and the author is threatening divorce if this continues.\n\nFirst, the author is standing up for his beliefs and the decision he made with his wife. They had an agreement, and he's enforcing it. But he's also threatening divorce because the father-in-law is interfering. The wife might be caught in the middle here. The author is protecting the child from religious indoctrination, which he has a right to do since it's his child too. However, the way he's handling it\u2014threatening divorce\u2014might be harsh. But maybe he's justified because he's protecting his child's upbringing. On the other hand, the wife might feel pressured between her family and her husband. If she's allowing the father-in-law to take the child without the husband's consent, that could be an issue. But maybe she's being manipulated by her family. The author's main issue is the unauthorized actions of the father-in-law, which is a breach of trust. So, is he in the wrong? It's complicated. He's asserting his parental rights, but the method of threatening divorce might be extreme. However, considering the circumstances, maybe he's right to protect his child's upbringing. So, I think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
