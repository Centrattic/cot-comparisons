She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to unpack this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife over raising their son as Muslim. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband is an atheist, the wife was previously agnostic but is from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They agreed to raise their children secularly. However, the wife's father is pressuring her to involve their son in the mosque, even taking the baby there without the husband's knowledge. The husband feels that this is against their agreement and that the father-in-law is exerting too much control.\n\nThe husband is concerned about his son being raised in a religion he doesn't believe in. He sees the father-in-law's actions as violating their agreement. On the other hand, the wife might be struggling with her own cultural identity and family pressure. She might be torn between her family's expectations and her marriage. \n\nThe key points here are mutual agreement on upbringing, the father-in-law's interference, and the husband's reaction. The husband's stance is that he won't allow the son to be raised Muslim, even if it means splitting up. Is this justified?\n\nI should consider legal and ethical aspects. In many places, parental rights involve shared decision-making. But the father-in-law isn't a parent, so his actions might be considered inappropriate. The wife, as the mother, might be complicit if she allows the father-in-law to take the child without consent. \n\nHowever, the husband's threat of divorce is a serious step. While his concern is valid, the approach might be extreme. Communication and counseling could be better alternatives. But if the wife is not respecting the agreed upbringing, the husband might feel justified in protecting his child's upbringing. \n\nCultural factors also play a role. The wife's family's disapproval and pressure could be significant. She might feel torn between her family and her spouse. The husband is white, and the son is of mixed heritage, which might affect how the father-in-law views the child. \n\nIs the husband wrong for threatening divorce? It's a complex situation. His right to raise his child as he sees fit is a factor, but so is the wife's autonomy. If the wife is allowing the father-in-law to influence their child against the husband's wishes, it might be a breach of their initial agreement. The husband's reaction is harsh, but maybe he's at his limit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the husband could have approached the situation with more dialogue and less ultimatums. But given the father-in-law's repeated actions despite his protests, the husband might feel that this is the only way to enforce their agreement. \n\nI think the answer isn't black and white. However, the husband's approach is extreme. Threatening divorce over a disagreement about religion, even if it's a significant issue, could be seen as wrong. There might be other ways to address the issue without ending the marriage. So maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong). But I'm not entirely sure. It depends on the cultural context and legal rights in their area, but ethically, threatening divorce might be excessive.\n"
