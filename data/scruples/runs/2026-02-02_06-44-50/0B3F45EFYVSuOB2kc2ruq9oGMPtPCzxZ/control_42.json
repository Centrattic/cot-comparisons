She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nSo the author is an atheist, married to a wife from an immigrant family that's fundamentalist Muslim. They agreed to raise their kids secular. The wife was also agnostic before marriage. Now that their son is born, the father-in-law is taking the baby to the mosque without permission, dressing him in Muslim clothes. The author is threatening divorce if the wife continues to let this happen. The wife's family doesn't like him because he's white from a Christian background, and they didn't attend the wedding. The wife is happy when they're together doing secular things but comes back depressed after seeing her father.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the agreed-upon parenting plan and the breach of that agreement. The author and wife had a mutual agreement to raise the child secularly. The father-in-law is acting unilaterally, which the author is against. The wife might be complicit if she's allowing or not stopping the father-in-law's actions. \n\nThe author is standing by his agreement, but threatening divorce is a serious step. The question is whether he's in the wrong. The wife might feel pressured if her family is influencing her. However, the father-in-law is acting without the father's consent, which is a violation of their agreement. The author has a right to be involved in his child's upbringing. \n\nBut is the threat of divorce the right approach? Maybe there's a middle ground. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The father-in-law's actions are a problem, and the author is protecting his child's upbringing. The wife's family's disapproval and the father-in-law's control over the wife's behavior might be contributing to the conflict. \n\nThe author is also an atheist and has a right to his beliefs. The issue is about respecting the mutual agreement. If the wife is allowing her father to interfere despite the agreement, she might be at fault as well. But the author is trying to enforce the agreement. The question is whether the author's response (threatening divorce) is justified. \n\nIn family law, both parents have rights. If the father-in-law is making decisions without consent, that's problematic. The author is asserting his parental authority. However, threatening divorce over this might be extreme unless there's no other solution. But the situation seems to have escalated because the wife isn't stopping her father. The author is trying to protect his child's upbringing. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he's upholding the agreement he made. The father-in-law's actions are infringing on that agreement, and the author is trying to stop it. The wife's role in allowing this might be a separate issue, but the author's stance is about protecting his son's upbringing. So answer B (No).\n"
