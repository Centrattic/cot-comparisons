She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The author is an atheist, married to a wife who comes from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They agreed to raise their kids secularly. But now the wife's father is taking their son to the mosque without the author's knowledge. The author is threatening divorce if the wife continues to let this happen.\n\nFirst, I should consider their original agreement. They both agreed that the kids would be raised secularly unless they choose otherwise later. So the author's main issue is that the father-in-law is influencing the child against his wishes. The wife might be conflicted between her family's religious expectations and her agreement with her husband.\n\nThe author feels that his son is being exposed to religious practices he didn't consent to. The father-in-law is acting like the author isn't the father, which is a problem. The author is standing up for his right to co-parent and make decisions about his child's upbringing. On the other hand, the wife might be under pressure from her family, which could affect her mental health, as mentioned she becomes depressed after seeing her father.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, he's asserting his parental rights, which is understandable. However, threatening divorce over this might be a heavy-handed approach. Maybe there are other ways to resolve the conflict, like mediation or setting clearer boundaries with the father-in-law. Also, the wife's autonomy comes into play here. She's an adult, and while the author is concerned about her being influenced by her family, he can't control her actions entirely. If she's choosing to allow her father to interact with the child in this way, despite their agreement, that's a point of contention.\n\nBut the father's right to co-parent is important. If the father-in-law is making decisions about the child's religious upbringing without the father's consent, that's a breach of parental authority. The author's frustration is valid because the child's upbringing is a major issue. However, the way he's handling it by threatening divorce might not be the best solution. It's possible he's not considering the emotional impact on his wife, who might feel caught between her husband and her family.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Maybe not entirely. He has a right to be involved in his child's upbringing. But the approach of threatening divorce might be too extreme without trying to resolve the issue through other means first. The key here is whether the author's actions are reasonable given the circumstances. He's protecting his son's upbringing, which is a parent's right, but the method of confrontation could be problematic. However, since the father-in-law is actively going against the agreed-upon parenting plan, the author's stance is understandable. I think the answer is B (No), he's not in the wrong because he's standing up for his parental rights, even if the approach could be debated.\n"
