She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is between the author, his wife, and her family. The author is an atheist, the wife used to be agnostic but now is Muslim, and they had agreed that their kids would be raised secular. But now the wife's father is taking their son to the mosque without the author's knowledge.\n\nFirst, the author and wife had a prior agreement about their child's upbringing. The author is clear that he doesn't want the religion drilled into their son. The wife agreed to this. However, the father-in-law is interfering by taking the son to the mosque and dressing him in Muslim clothes without the author's consent. The author feels that this is against his wishes and that the father-in-law is exerting control over the wife and the child.\n\nThe author's main argument is about the child's upbringing. Since he and his wife had agreed on secular upbringing, but the father-in-law's actions are going against that. The author is firm in his stance, even stating that he would divorce his wife if she continues to allow this. The wife is caught in the middle between her family's expectations and her marriage to the author.\n\nNow, considering the legal and ethical aspects. In many jurisdictions, parental rights regarding a child's upbringing are shared between both parents. If one parent is acting unilaterally without the other's consent, especially in matters of religion, that could be a problem. The author is standing up for his beliefs and the agreed-upon plan for their child. However, threatening divorce over this might be seen as extreme, but the underlying issue is the violation of their prior agreement and the father-in-law's interference.\n\nThe wife's family's disapproval of the author due to his race adds another layer of cultural tension. The wife is trying to maintain her family relationships while respecting her husband's wishes. Her father's actions of taking the child without consent are problematic, and the author is trying to assert his parental rights.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if the father-in-law is acting without the consent of the other parent, that's an issue. The author is protecting his child from religious influence he disagrees with. However, the use of a divorce ultimatum might be seen as harsh. But given the context of prior agreement and ongoing interference, it's a serious matter for the author. The wife's complicity is also a factor\u2014if she's allowing the father to take the child despite knowing the author's stance, that complicates things.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for his parental rights and the agreed upbringing. The father-in-law is overstepping, and the wife's family's actions are undermining the parents' agreement. The author's reaction, while intense, is a response to a breach of their mutual agreement and interference in their child's upbringing. So, the answer is likely B (No).\n"
