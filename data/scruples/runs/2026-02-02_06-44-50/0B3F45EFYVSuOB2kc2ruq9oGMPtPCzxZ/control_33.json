She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for threatening divorce over his wife's religious practices regarding their son.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the situation. The user is an atheist, married to a wife from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They agreed to raise their children secularly. However, the wife's father is taking their son to the mosque without the husband's consent. The husband is upset and has told his wife he'll divorce her if she continues to let this happen.\n\nThe key points here are the initial agreement between the couple about their children's upbringing, the violation of that agreement by the wife's family, and the husband's response. The wife is caught between her family's pressures and her marriage. The husband feels his wishes are being disregarded, especially since the son is his as well. \n\nI need to consider legal aspects too. In many places, both parents have equal rights in raising their children, and one parent can't force the other to raise the child a certain way. But since the husband is objecting to the father-in-law's actions, not the wife's direct actions, there might be a gray area. If the wife is allowing her father to influence their son against the husband's wishes, that's a conflict of interest. \n\nThe husband's stance is about protecting his son's upbringing, which he values highly. However, threatening divorce over this is a significant consequence. The wife might feel that her family's involvement is part of her cultural identity, and she's struggling with the pressure from both sides. \n\nIs the husband in the wrong? It depends on whether he's respecting their initial agreement and the wife's autonomy. If the wife is actively complicit in allowing her father to take the child without the husband's consent, maybe she's at fault. But the husband is also enforcing the agreement strictly, which could be seen as protecting their original terms. \n\nHowever, threatening divorce over this might be an overreaction. There might be other ways to resolve the conflict, like involving legal means or counseling. The husband's approach is confrontational, but the core issue is about respecting the agreed-upon parenting plan. The wife's actions (allowing her father to take the child) could be seen as breaking that agreement, which the husband has a right to object to. \n\nSo, considering all that, the husband might not be in the wrong because he's standing by their agreement. But the way he's handling it could be problematic. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong, not if there's a better way. Since the wife broke their agreement, his response, while harsh, might be justified from his perspective. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
