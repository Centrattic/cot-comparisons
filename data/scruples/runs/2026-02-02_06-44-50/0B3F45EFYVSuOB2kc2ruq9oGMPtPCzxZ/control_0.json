She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a husband who is atheist and a wife who comes from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They agreed to raise their kids secular, but the wife's father is taking their son to the mosque without the husband's knowledge. The husband threatens divorce if the wife continues to allow this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The couple had an agreement about their son's upbringing. The husband is standing by that agreement, but the wife's family is interfering. The father-in-law is acting against the husband's wishes, which is a conflict. The husband's concern is about his son's upbringing and not wanting his child exposed to religious practices against his beliefs.\n\nThe wife might be caught between her family and her husband. She might feel pressure from her father to follow Muslim traditions, even though she was previously agnostic. The husband is frustrated because despite her agreeing to the secular upbringing, her family is still influencing the child. The key here is the agreement between the couple and the breach by the wife's family. \n\nThe husband's threat of divorce is a strong move. But considering that they had an agreement, and the wife's family is undermining that, is he justified? He's trying to protect his son's upbringing as per their agreement. However, the wife's actions (allowing her father to take the child) might be seen as violating that agreement. \n\nBut is the husband wrong for threatening divorce? Divorce is a big step, but if the agreement is central to their relationship, maybe it's understandable. The father-in-law's actions are problematic, but the wife's complicity in letting it happen could be an issue. The husband feels his boundaries are crossed, so his reaction might be seen as self-protective.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel torn between her family and her husband. Maybe she's not intentionally going against the agreement but is influenced by her father. The husband could be being too rigid, especially since the son is a baby and might not remember much. However, the principle of the agreement is important here. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because he's upholding the agreement they made. The wife's family's actions are interfering, and he's standing his ground to protect his and his wife's agreement. The threat of divorce is extreme but might be justified given the circumstances. So the answer is B.\n"
