She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with differing religious views. The husband is an atheist, the wife was previously agnostic but now seems to be leaning towards Islam, influenced by her fundamentalist family. They had an agreement that their children would be raised secular, but the wife's father is taking their son to the mosque without the husband's knowledge.\n\nFirst, the main issue is about the authority over the child's upbringing. The husband is adamant about secular upbringing, while the wife's family is pushing Islamic values. The husband found out that the father-in-law took the son to the mosque, which violates their agreement. The husband's response is to threaten divorce if the wife continues this behavior.\n\nI need to consider the legal and ethical aspects here. In many places, both parents have equal rights in raising the child, but there's also the aspect of mutual agreement. The couple had agreed on secular upbringing, so the husband feels his rights are being violated. However, the wife might be influenced by her family, possibly under pressure. The father-in-law's actions without the husband's consent could be problematic, especially since the child is very young.\n\nThe husband's threat to divorce is a strong measure. While he has valid concerns about his son's upbringing, the way he's handling it by ultimatum might be seen as extreme. The wife might feel trapped between her husband's demands and her family's expectations. It's possible that she's not intentionally going against her husband but is being influenced by her father.\n\nAnother angle is the wife's mental health. She's happy at home but depressed when with her father, indicating she's caught in a conflict. The husband acknowledging she's an adult who can make her own choices but still taking a firm stance on the child's upbringing might not address the underlying issues in their relationship.\n\nLegally, in cases where parents disagree on religious upbringing, courts often consider the child's best interest, which includes not pressuring the child into a religion. However, the husband's approach to resolving this conflict might not be the healthiest. Instead of threatening divorce, perhaps seeking mediation or counseling would be more constructive.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the husband is trying to protect his son from religious influence, which he sees as against their agreement. But using a divorce ultimatum as a means to enforce this could be seen as extreme. The father-in-law's actions are also problematic, but the husband's response might not be the most effective way to address the situation.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to protect his child's upbringing, but his method of handling the conflict by threatening divorce could be problematic. The answer would depend on whether the threat is proportionate and if there are other ways to resolve the issue. In this case, the husband's stance on the upbringing is valid, but the ultimatum might be excessive, but the core issue is about the father-in-law's actions. However, the question is whether the author (husband) is in the wrong. The key is whether his actions (threatening divorce) are justified. Since the father-in-law is violating their agreement, the husband's frustration is understandable, but threatening divorce over the wife's actions, which might be due to pressure from her family, could be seen as harsh. So, maybe he's not in the wrong, but his approach is flawed. The answer would be B for No, but with reservations.\n"
