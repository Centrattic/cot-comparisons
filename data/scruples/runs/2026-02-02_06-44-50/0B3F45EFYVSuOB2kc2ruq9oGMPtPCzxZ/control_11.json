She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author and his wife married two years ago. She comes from a fundamentalist Muslim family, but when they met, she was agnostic. He's an atheist, and they agreed their kids would be raised secular. Now that they have a son, her family is pressuring them to raise the child Muslim. The father-in-law even took the baby to the mosque without their consent. The author is upset because he values his secular upbringing and doesn't want his son exposed to religious indoctrination. He's threatening divorce if his wife continues to allow this.\n\nSo, where's the conflict? The author is standing by his original agreement, but his wife might be swaying under family pressure. The father-in-law's actions are a key point here\u2014doing things without the parents' consent is definitely a problem. The author is concerned about his son's upbringing, which is a parent's right. But by threatening divorce, is he overreacting?\n\nThe wife's perspective is tricky. She might feel torn between her husband and her family. She agreed to secular upbringing, but maybe she's not in a position to resist her family's influence. However, allowing her father to take the baby without permission isn't okay. The author's anger is because his boundaries are being crossed. Divorce is a drastic step, but if the wife continues to compromise his wishes, he might feel it's the only option left.\n\nIs the author wrong? Maybe not. He's protecting his child's upbringing, which is a valid concern. But communication is key. Has he tried to address the issue with his wife beyond just threatening divorce? The wife's mental health is also mentioned; she's depressed after visiting her father. The author might not be considering her struggles, but his stance is about his son's future.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the father-in-law's unauthorized actions and the wife's continued involvement. The author's threat is a reaction to broken trust and violation of their agreement. Since the wife is an adult and the author has communicated his stance multiple times, his decision to set a firm boundary isn't necessarily wrong. Therefore, the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
