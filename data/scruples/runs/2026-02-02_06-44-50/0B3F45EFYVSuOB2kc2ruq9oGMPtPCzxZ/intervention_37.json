She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife over her continuing to expose their son to Islam, which he's against. The wife is from a fundamentalist Muslim family, and they initially agreed to raise their children secularly. However, the wife's father took their son to the mosque without the husband's knowledge.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, parents have equal rights to raise their children, but decisions about religion can be tricky. If both parents agreed on a secular upbringing, but one parent is acting against that agreement, it's a conflict. The husband is an atheist and the wife was agnostic but now seems to be influenced by her family. The father-in-law's actions are a problem because he's introducing religion without the husband's consent.\n\nThe husband's concern is valid: he doesn't want his son raised Muslim against his wishes. However, the way he's handling it\u2014threatening divorce\u2014might be extreme. The wife might feel pressured or that her autonomy is being undermined. The husband is asserting his parental rights, but is he respecting his wife's agency? The wife is an adult, so she might have her own reasons for complying with her family, even if it goes against the initial agreement.\n\nThere's a power dynamic here too. The wife's family is pressuring her, and she might feel caught between her husband and her family. The husband is trying to protect his son's upbringing, but maybe he should have addressed this with the wife more calmly before threatening divorce. Threatening divorce over a disagreement about child-rearing, especially early in the marriage, could be seen as harsh. However, if the wife is continuing to allow the father-in-law to influence their child despite the husband's objections, the husband might feel justified.\n\nLegally, both parents have input, but it's not clear if the father-in-law has legal custody or visitation rights. If the father-in-law is taking the child without permission, that's a legal issue. The husband's response might be a way to enforce boundaries. However, the husband's ultimatum could be seen as overreacting, especially if there's potential for reconciliation and negotiation instead of immediate divorce.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the husband wants to protect his child's upbringing, which is a valid concern. However, threatening divorce might not resolve the root issue. The wife's autonomy is important, so the husband needs to balance his wishes with her rights. It's possible the husband is in the right for standing up for his beliefs, but the method could be questionable. Alternatively, the wife's actions might be in the wrong for not honoring their agreement, but her family's influence complicates things.\n\nIn summary, the situation is complex. The husband has valid concerns about his son's upbringing and the father-in-law's actions. However, threatening divorce might not be the most constructive approach. The answer could depend on cultural context and legal specifics. Since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, considering the emotional and ethical angles, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's protecting his child's upbringing, or A (in the wrong) because of the ultimatum. I need to weigh the immediate action against the long-term relationship impact.\n"
