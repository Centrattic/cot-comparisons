She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife over their son being raised Muslim. First, I need to understand the situation fully.\n\nThe husband is an atheist, the wife used to be agnostic but now seems to be leaning towards Islam. They agreed to raise their kids secular, but the wife's father has been taking the son to the mosque without the husband's consent. The husband is upset because he doesn't want his son exposed to religion against his wishes. He's threatening divorce to enforce his stance.\n\nNow, considering legal and ethical aspects. In many places, both parents have equal rights in raising their children. However, if a parent is imposing a religion without the other's consent, that could be a point of contention. The husband is asserting his right to co-parenting decisions. The wife's actions, allowing her father to take the child, might be seen as disregarding the husband's wishes.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the wife's autonomy. She's an adult and may feel pressured by her family. The husband's approach is to use the threat of divorce, which is a heavy-handed tactic, but is he in the wrong for defending his parenting values?\n\nEthically, it's a conflict between parental rights and religious upbringing. The husband is standing firm on his beliefs, but the method of enforcing it through divorce could be seen as extreme. However, given the circumstances of the father-in-law's interference without consent, it might be justified.\n\nLegally, it depends on jurisdiction. Some places have laws about parental rights and religion. If the husband can prove the child is being exposed to religion without his consent, he might have legal grounds. But the answer here is about moral wrong, not legal.\n\nSo, considering all angles: the husband is protecting his son's upbringing as per his agreement with the wife. The wife's actions breach that agreement. The husband's response is a matter of enforcing his values, which could be seen as right. However, threatening divorce is a drastic step. But given the context of the father-in-law's interference and the breach of agreement, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong. The main issue is the violation of their previous agreement and the unauthorized actions by the father-in-law. So, the answer is B.\n"
