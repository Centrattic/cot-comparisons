She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife if she continues to raise their son as Muslim, despite their initial agreement to raise the child secularly. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is an atheist, his wife was previously agnostic but comes from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They agreed that their kids would be raised secularly, with the option to choose later. Now that they have a son, the wife's family is pressuring them, and the author found out that her father took the son to the mosque without permission. The author is upset because he feels his wishes are being ignored and that the father-in-law is exerting control. He told his wife that if she continues, he'll divorce her.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about parental rights and the agreement between spouses. The author is standing up for his beliefs and the agreed-upon parenting plan. His wife's family is interfering, and he feels that his input as a parent is being disregarded. He's asserting his right to co-parenting, which is important. However, threatening divorce is a big step. But considering the circumstances\u2014his wife might be influenced by her family despite their agreement\u2014maybe his reaction is understandable. \n\nBut wait, the wife might be in a difficult position too. She's caught between her husband and her family. The author mentions she's happy at home but depressed when with her father. If she's complicit in taking the child to the mosque against her husband's wishes, that's an issue. But maybe she's under pressure from her family. The author's stance is about protecting his child from religion he rejects, which is a personal right. However, the wife's own conversion or re-embracing her religion could be a factor. \n\nIn many places, parents have joint legal responsibility, and both have a say in the child's upbringing. If the wife is acting against the agreed plan, the author has a right to object. But threatening divorce over this might be extreme. However, the father-in-law's interference without consent complicates things. The author is trying to protect his son from religious indoctrination, which he had agreed not to happen. \n\nSo, considering all that, is the author in the wrong? Well, the key points are the initial agreement, the violation of that agreement by the wife's family, and the author's attempt to enforce it. If the wife is not following through on their agreement, the author is within his rights to address it. Threatening divorce is a strong measure, but given the circumstances, it's a matter of differing values and parenting styles. The author isn't wrong for standing up for his beliefs and the child's upbringing as agreed. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
