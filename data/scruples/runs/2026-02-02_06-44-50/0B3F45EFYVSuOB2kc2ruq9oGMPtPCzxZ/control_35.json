She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is an atheist married to a wife from an immigrant Muslim family. They had an agreement that their kids would be raised secular. The wife was previously agnostic but now her family is pressuring her, and she's allowing her father to take their son to the mosque without the author's knowledge. The author is threatening to divorce her if this continues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider their original agreement. Both agreed on secular upbringing if they had kids. The wife agreed to that before having the child, so the author's stance is based on that prior agreement. The father-in-law is acting against the author's wishes by taking the son to the mosque, which the author sees as violating their agreement.\n\nBut here's the thing: the wife is an adult and has her own family pressures. The author is her husband, so he has a right to be involved in the upbringing of their child. However, making an ultimatum about divorce over this might be extreme. The key here is whether the author overstepped by using the threat of divorce, especially since the wife might be caught in the middle between her family and her husband.\n\nThe father-in-law's actions are problematic because he's influencing the child without the author's consent. The author is protecting his son's upbringing, which is a significant concern. But is threatening divorce the right approach? The wife might feel torn between her husband and her family, and the author's ultimatum could be seen as dismissive of her situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has a valid right to ensure his son is raised according to their shared agreement. If the wife is allowing her family to override that agreement, then the author is within his rights to express his concerns. However, making a divorce threat could be seen as holding the marriage hostage over a disagreement, especially if the wife isn't directly violating the agreement but is perhaps influenced by her family.\n\nAnother angle is that the wife might be struggling with her own identity and family pressures. The author is her husband, so ideally they should work together to find a solution rather than using a threat of divorce. Communication and compromise might be better approaches than an ultimatum. The fact that the father-in-law is ignoring the author's wishes adds to the tension, but the author's response is to escalate the conflict.\n\nIn summary, while the author has a right to be involved in his son's upbringing and is protecting their original agreement, the method of threatening divorce seems extreme. The wife is an adult and might need support rather than being part of an ultimatum. The author's approach could be contributing to the problem by not addressing the root issues through dialogue and finding a middle ground. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for using such a drastic threat rather than seeking a collaborative solution.\n"
