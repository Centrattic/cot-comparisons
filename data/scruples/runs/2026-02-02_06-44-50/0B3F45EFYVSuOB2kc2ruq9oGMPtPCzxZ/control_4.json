She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife over religious upbringing of their son.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is an atheist, the wife was agnostic but now seems to be leaning towards Islam. They had an agreement that their children would be raised secular. The father-in-law is pressuring the wife and even took the son to the mosque without the author's knowledge. The author feels that the father-in-law is controlling and not respecting his role as a parent. He's threatening divorce to prevent his son from being raised Muslim.\n\nNow, legal aspects: In many places, both parents have equal rights in child custody. Unless there's a court order, neither can unilaterally decide religious upbringing against the other's wishes. The father-in-law taking the child to the mosque without consent might be problematic legally, but the mother's role here is tricky. She might be influenced by her family, but she is an adult and the legal parent. The author has a right to be involved in his child's upbringing, so his stance on preventing religious instruction against his wishes is understandable.\n\nEthically, the situation is more complex. The author is standing up for his beliefs and the agreement made with his wife. However, threatening divorce over this could be seen as extreme. The wife might be caught between her family and her marriage. The author's approach might be seen as taking a firm stand for his values, but it's also causing marital strain. The wife's actions are a concern, but the author's response is a major consequence.\n\nPotential issues with the author's approach: He's using the threat of divorce as leverage, which might not be the healthiest way to resolve the conflict. There might be room for negotiation or legal mediation instead of an ultimatum. However, given his strong stance on not wanting his son raised Muslim, he might feel this is the only option left after other attempts failed.\n\nOn the other hand, the father-in-law's actions are clearly violating the parents' agreement, which is a breach of trust. The author has every right to be upset. The wife's compliance with her father's actions despite her previous agreement could indicate a shift in her stance, but the author might not have addressed this with her properly before escalating.\n\nIn terms of rights, the author is asserting his parental rights, which are important. However, the method of using divorce as a threat might not be the best approach. But given the circumstances, he's not necessarily in the wrong. The key is whether his actions are justified. Since the other parent's actions (both the wife and father-in-law) are violating their prior agreement, the author is trying to protect his child's upbringing as per the original agreement.\n\nSo, balancing legal rights and ethical considerations, the author is not in the wrong. He's defending his agreed-upon parental rights. However, the way he's handling it could be better, but the answer is whether he's in the wrong, not whether his approach is optimal. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
