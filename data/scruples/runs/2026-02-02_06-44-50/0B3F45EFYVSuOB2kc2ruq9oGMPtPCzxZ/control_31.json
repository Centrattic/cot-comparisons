She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after threatening divorce over their wife's Muslim upbringing of their son. Let's start by looking at the key elements of the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple married two years ago with an agreement to raise their children secularly. The wife comes from a fundamentalist Muslim family, and the husband is an atheist. They agreed that the children could choose their religion later. However, the wife's father started taking the son to the mosque without the husband's consent, which the husband objects to. The husband feels his wife is going against their agreement and allowing her father too much influence. He threatens divorce if the situation continues.\n\nNow, considering the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in many places, both parents have equal rights to make decisions about their child's upbringing unless there's a court order. However, if the father objects to religious instruction without his consent, he might have legal grounds to contest it. But the situation here is more about personal conflict than legal process.\n\nEthically, the husband's stance is about parental rights and autonomy. He values secular upbringing and views the religious influence from his in-laws as a threat. The wife, however, might feel caught between her family's expectations and her marriage. She might be struggling with her own beliefs, especially if she was agnostic when they married but now feels pressured by her family.\n\nThe husband's approach of threatening divorce is a strong move. While he's standing up for his beliefs, it's a drastic step that could be seen as dismissive of his wife's autonomy. The wife is an adult, and if she's willingly engaging with her family's religion, the husband might be overstepping by controlling the child's upbringing solely. However, the father's concern about his son's religious indoctrination without his consent is valid. The father-in-law's actions are problematic as they involve a child without the other parent's agreement.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the wife's mental health. She becomes depressed and ashamed when interacting with her father, indicating she's under family pressure. The husband might be trying to protect her from this stress, which is a positive aspect. But threatening divorce could strain their relationship further, especially if the wife feels her cultural background is being dismissed.\n\nIn terms of fault, the husband isn't entirely wrong in wanting his son to be raised secularly as agreed. However, his ultimatum approach without seeking mediation or understanding his wife's perspective could be seen as harsh. The wife's in-laws' actions are definitely problematic, but the husband's threat might not be the best solution. There's a need for communication and perhaps counseling to address the underlying issues rather than an immediate divorce threat.\n\nSo, while the husband's concerns are valid, his method of handling the situation could be questioned. He might not be in the wrong entirely, but the approach is questionable. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that there's room for better conflict resolution.\n"
