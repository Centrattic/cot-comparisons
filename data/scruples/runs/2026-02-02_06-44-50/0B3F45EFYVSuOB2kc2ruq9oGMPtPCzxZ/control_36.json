She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife over her religious upbringing of their son. The key points here are the conflict between their initial agreement on secular upbringing, the father-in-law's actions, and the author's response.\n\nFirst, the author and wife had an agreement that their children would be raised secular. The wife agreed to this. However, the father-in-law is pressuring the wife and even taking the son to the mosque without the author's consent. The author is upset because he doesn't want his son exposed to Islamic teachings against his wishes. \n\nNow, the author's response was to tell his wife that if she continues to raise the son as Muslim, he'll divorce her. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, both parents have the right to have a say in their child's upbringing. However, the father-in-law's actions without the author's consent are a problem. The wife might be under pressure from her family, which complicates things. The author is trying to enforce their agreement, but by threatening divorce, he might be overreacting. \n\nEmotionally, the author is standing by his beliefs and protecting his child's upbringing as per their agreement. However, using divorce as a threat might not be the healthiest approach in resolving the conflict. It could lead to more tension and maybe not address the root issue of the wife's family influence. \n\nThe wife's perspective is also important. She might feel torn between her husband's wishes and her family's expectations. The author's statement that she's an adult and can do what she wants, but then threatening divorce, seems contradictory. It could be seen as controlling if he's not allowing her autonomy while also not handling the situation through communication or mediation.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author's primary concern is his son's upbringing, which is valid. But the method of resolving it by threatening divorce without considering alternatives (like counseling, legal steps, or setting clear boundaries with the in-law) might be seen as extreme. Also, the father-in-law's actions are problematic, but the author should address them directly with the wife and possibly through legal means rather than using divorce as a leverage.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but his approach could be better. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer likely hinges on whether the threat of divorce is justified given the circumstances. Since he's trying to protect his child's upbringing as agreed, but using a harsh method, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the key point is that both parents have rights, and the author's actions are in line with his initial agreement, even if the method is questionable.\n"
