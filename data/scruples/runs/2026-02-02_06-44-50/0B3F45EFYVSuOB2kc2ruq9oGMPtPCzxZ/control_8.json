She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife if she continues to raise their son as Muslim. The author is an atheist, the wife was previously agnostic but now seems to be leaning towards Islam, influenced by her fundamentalist family. They had agreed on secular upbringing, but the wife's father took their son to the mosque without the husband's knowledge.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The husband and wife had an agreement about their children's upbringing. The husband is firm about a secular approach, while the wife's family is pushing for Islamic influence. The father-in-law is acting against the husband's wishes, and the wife might be complicit or unable to resist her family's pressure. The husband feels that his parental rights are being undermined.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue here is about parental rights and the agreed-upon parenting decisions. The husband is standing by the initial agreement, but the wife is not following through, possibly due to external pressures. However, threatening divorce over this is a serious matter. \n\nI should consider if there are other ways to resolve this conflict before taking such a drastic step. Maybe communication, counseling, or legal steps to establish custody and parenting agreements. But the husband feels that the wife's family is exerting too much control, which is a valid concern. Also, the wife might be caught between her family and her husband, which is a difficult position.\n\nOn the other hand, threatening divorce for not adhering to a parenting agreement could be seen as extreme. The husband's stance is about protecting his child's upbringing, which is a significant aspect of parenting. However, the way he's approaching it\u2014by ultimatum\u2014might not address the underlying issues, like the wife's loyalty or her ability to manage her family's influence.\n\nAnother angle is that the wife might have changed her beliefs or is being influenced by her family, which the husband didn't anticipate. The initial agreement was mutual, but circumstances have changed. The husband's reaction could be seen as inconsiderate of her personal growth or the pressure she's facing. But at the same time, he's trying to honor the original agreement they had to raise the child secularly.\n\nLegal perspectives might vary, but in terms of moral responsibility, the husband is trying to uphold the terms they agreed upon. However, his method of enforcing it through an ultimatum could be problematic. Divorce is a major decision and might not be the only solution if there's a possibility of reconciliation or compromise.\n\nSo, balancing these factors, the husband's intention is to protect his child's upbringing, which is a valid parental concern. However, the manner in which he's handling it\u2014threatening divorce without addressing the root issues and potential for resolution\u2014might not be the best approach. The wife's role in this is also important; she needs to assert her independence to protect both her marriage and her son's upbringing.\n\nIn conclusion, while the husband has legitimate concerns about the agreed-upon parenting plan being violated, his response could be seen as extreme. There might be better ways to handle the situation without resorting to divorce. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not exploring other solutions first and for using an ultimatum. However, the core issue of violating the parenting agreement is on the wife and her family. The answer isn't straightforward, but considering the ultimatum aspect, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
