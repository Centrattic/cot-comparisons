She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the Reddit-style AMA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong.\n\nSo the situation is that the author is an atheist married to a wife from a fundamentalist Muslim immigrant family. They agreed that their children would be raised secularly. However, the wife's father is taking their son to the mosque and dressing him in Muslim clothes without the author's knowledge. The author is threatening divorce if the wife continues to allow this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The couple had an agreement about their children's upbringing. The wife's family is pressuring them, and the father-in-law is taking actions against the author's wishes. The author is standing by his agreement and is willing to end the marriage if the situation isn't resolved.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, parents have rights over their children's upbringing, but both parents share that responsibility. If the wife is going along with her father's actions against the husband's wishes, there might be an issue of consent or agreement. However, the wife might feel pressured by her family, which complicates things. The author is asserting his rights as a parent, which is understandable, but is he overreacting by threatening divorce?\n\nEthically, it's about mutual respect and compromise. The couple had an agreement, so the wife might be violating that by not preventing her father's actions. However, the wife might be struggling with her own family's expectations and her marriage. The author's threat of divorce is a serious step, but if he truly believes the agreement is non-negotiable, it's his right to enforce it. On the other hand, maybe there's a need for communication and understanding rather than an immediate ultimatum.\n\nAnother angle is the wife's autonomy. She is an adult and can choose her own beliefs, but as a parent, she shares responsibility with her husband. If she's complicit in her father's actions, that's a problem. However, if she's being manipulated or controlled by her family, the situation is more complex.\n\nIn terms of cultural sensitivity, the author might be dismissive of the wife's background, while she might feel torn between her family and her marriage. The father-in-law's actions are invasive, and the author is protecting his child's upbringing. But threatening divorce over this could be seen as extreme, especially if there's a lack of dialogue and attempts to resolve it amicably.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author is standing by his agreement, which is valid. However, threatening divorce without trying to resolve the issue together might be hasty. The wife's role in allowing her father's actions is also a point. But given the information, the author is not entirely in the wrong because he's protecting his child's upbringing as per their agreement. However, the approach could be better handled with more communication. But based on the scenario, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because he's enforcing the agreement they had.\n"
