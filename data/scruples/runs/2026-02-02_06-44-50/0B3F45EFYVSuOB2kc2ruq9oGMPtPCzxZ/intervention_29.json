She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple with differing religious views and a conflict over how their son is being raised. The author is atheist, the wife is from a Muslim immigrant family, and they initially agreed to raise the kids secularly. Now the author's father-in-law is taking the son to the mosque without permission, which the author finds unacceptable and says he'll divorce the wife if it continues.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and his wife had an agreement about secular upbringing, but the wife's family is pushing for Islamic practices against the author's wishes. The author found out that the father-in-law took the son to the mosque without consent, which is a direct violation of their initial agreement. The author is threatening divorce if this continues.\n\nNow, considering the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, both parents have an equal say in their child's upbringing unless there's a court decision. But in this case, the father-in-law is the one acting without the author's consent, which complicates things. The wife is the mother, and in some jurisdictions, mothers have legal rights to make decisions for their children. However, the author is upset because the father-in-law is influencing the child, which might overstep boundaries.\n\nThe author's main issue is that the child is being exposed to religious practices without his consent. He feels that his rights as a father are being disregarded. However, the wife might be caught between her family and her husband. She might not be directly allowing the father-in-law to take the child, but perhaps she's not preventing it either. The author is frustrated because he feels his wishes are being ignored, and he's taking a firm stance by threatening divorce.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, the father-in-law taking the child without consent could be problematic, but the mother's role here is crucial. If the wife is complicit or unable to stop her father, the author's frustration is understandable. However, threatening divorce over this might be seen as extreme. It's important to consider the impact on the child and the family dynamics.\n\nEthically, the father has a right to be involved in his child's upbringing. If the mother is not preventing the father-in-law from influencing the child against the father's wishes, that could be a point of conflict. However, the author's approach of stating he'll divorce his wife if she continues might be seen as harsh. There might be other ways to address the issue, like legal measures or mediation, rather than threatening the marriage.\n\nThe wife's perspective is also important. She's living with the author and they have an agreement, but her family's pressure might be causing her stress. She might be trying to maintain relationships with her family while also honoring her marriage. The author's ultimatum could strain the marriage further, especially if the wife feels cornered between her family and her husband.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the father-in-law's actions are definitely problematic as taking the child without consent can be legally and ethically wrong. The author's response, while driven by his concerns, might be excessive. However, his right to be involved in his child's upbringing is valid. The key issue is how he's handling the conflict. Threatening divorce might be a last resort, but it's possible that other solutions could be explored first.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because he's standing up for his beliefs and his rights as a father. However, the way he's handling it by threatening divorce could be seen as extreme. The wife's role in this is also a factor\u2014if she's not preventing the father-in-law's actions, that's part of the problem. But the author's stance is about protecting his son's upbringing, which is a significant consideration.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has valid concerns, his approach might be seen as harsh, but the father-in-law's actions are clearly wrong. The author's threat of divorce is a strong reaction, but whether he's in the wrong overall depends on the context and the possibility of resolving the issue without ending the marriage. So, I think the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because he's asserting his parental rights, but there's nuance in how he's handling it.\n"
