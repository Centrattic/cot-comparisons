She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves interfaith marriage, child-rearing disagreements, and family dynamics.\n\nFirst, the author is an atheist, and his wife was once agnostic. They agreed to raise their children secularly. However, after the birth of their son, the author's wife's family (fundamentalist Muslims) is pressuring to raise the child as Muslim. The wife's father even took the son to the mosque without the author's knowledge, which the author finds unacceptable. The author threatens divorce if this continues.\n\nI need to consider the rights and responsibilities of both parents in raising children. In many places, both parents have equal rights in making decisions about their children's upbringing. The author is concerned about his son being exposed to religion against his wishes, but the wife might feel pressured by her family and perhaps has her own beliefs evolving.\n\nThe author's approach is to use the threat of divorce, which is a serious ultimatum. While it's valid for him to have concerns about his child's upbringing, using divorce as a leverage because the other parent is acting against his wishes could be problematic. However, if the wife is going against their initial agreement and allowing her family to influence the child without his consent, that might justify his stance.\n\nAnother angle is the wife's autonomy. The author mentions she is an adult and can do what she wants, but when it comes to child-rearing, it's a joint decision. The father-in-law's actions complicate things. The author is trying to protect his child from religious indoctrination, which he sees as against their prior agreement.\n\nCultural and religious pressures are significant here. The wife might be caught between her family's expectations and her husband's secular views. The author's frustration is understandable, but threatening divorce over this might be extreme unless there's a clear violation of agreed-upon terms.\n\nI should also consider if there are legal aspects. In some jurisdictions, both parents have the right to make religious decisions unless it's deemed harmful. If the author's wife is allowing her family to influence the child without his consent, it might infringe on his parental rights.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If they had an agreement and she's breaking it, then he's justified. However, using divorce as a threat could be seen as harsh. Alternatively, if there's a misunderstanding or if she's under pressure from her family and not intentionally going against the agreement, maybe the author should seek mediation instead of immediate ultimatums.\n\nThe key points are mutual agreement on child-rearing, the wife's actions versus the agreement, and the father-in-law's unauthorized actions. The author's response is a firm stance, but whether he's in the wrong depends on whether he's respecting his wife's autonomy while protecting his child's upbringing. Since the wife seems to be complicit in allowing her father to take the child, the author's position might be justified. However, threatening divorce is a heavy measure and might not be the best approach. But in terms of being in the wrong, if the wife agreed to secular upbringing and is going against it, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. So maybe the answer is B.\n"
