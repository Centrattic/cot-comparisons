She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple with differing religious beliefs and a conflict over how their son should be raised.\n\nFirst, the author is an atheist, and his wife was agnostic when they married. They agreed to raise their children secularly. Now that their son is born, the wife's father, who is a fundamentalist Muslim, is pressuring them to take the child to the mosque and dress him in Muslim clothes without the author's knowledge. The author feels that the father-in-law is exerting control over his wife and the child, which he opposes. He has told the wife that he might divorce her if she continues to allow this, even though she's his wife.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the initial agreement on secular upbringing, the father-in-law's actions without consent, and the author's ultimatum. The user is wondering if the author is in the wrong. \n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The wife might be caught between her family and her husband. The father-in-law's actions are against the agreed-upon parenting plan. The author is trying to enforce his side of the agreement. But does threatening divorce over a breach of that agreement make him wrong? Or is he justified in protecting his child's upbringing as per their prior agreement?\n\nAlso, the wife's compliance with her father's actions could be a factor. If she's allowing her father to influence the child against her husband's wishes, maybe she's not fulfilling her part of the agreement. The author's response is to threaten divorce, which is a serious step. However, the father-in-law isn't the one being addressed directly by the husband; it's the wife who's the parent and the spouse. The author might feel that the wife isn't standing up for the agreement they had.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might be under pressure from her family, and maybe she's struggling with her own beliefs or familial expectations. The author's approach might be too harsh, but given the circumstances, he's trying to protect his child's upbringing as per their agreement. The question is whether the author's ultimatum is justified. \n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, parents typically have shared responsibility in raising children. If one parent is allowing a third party (the father-in-law) to influence the child against the other parent's wishes, that could be problematic. The author is asserting his parental rights, which might be seen as valid. However, the method of communication\u2014threatening divorce\u2014might be seen as extreme, but the situation is serious.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because he's trying to uphold the agreed-upon parenting plan and protect his child from religious upbringing against their agreement. The wife's compliance with her father's actions could be the issue, but the author is reacting to her not maintaining the original agreement. Threatening divorce is a strong measure, but given the circumstances, it might be his way of enforcing the boundaries they had set. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
