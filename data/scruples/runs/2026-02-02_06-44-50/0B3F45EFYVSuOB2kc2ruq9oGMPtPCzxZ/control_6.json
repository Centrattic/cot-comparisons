She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for threatening divorce over their wife's religious upbringing of their son.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The author is an atheist, married to a wife from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They agreed to raise their child secularly. The wife's family, especially her father, is pressuring to involve the son in Islamic practices. The father-in-law took the son to the mosque without consent, and the author feels this violates their agreement. The wife is conflicted but seems to comply with her family's wishes despite agreeing to the secular upbringing.\n\nThe author is threatening divorce to prevent his son from being raised Muslim. The wife is an adult, so why is she not stopping her father? The author feels his wishes are being disregarded, and the father-in-law is ignoring his authority as the father.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, parents generally have equal rights in child-rearing, but if there's a conflict, courts may consider the child's best interests. The author is asserting his parental rights against the grandmother and father-in-law. However, the wife is the mother, and she's the one who's not standing up to her family. The author's threat to divorce is based on his unwillingness to let his son be raised Muslim, which he sees as against the agreed-upon secular upbringing.\n\nEthically, the author might argue that he's protecting his son from religious indoctrination against their original agreement. However, the wife's autonomy is also a factor. By threatening divorce, he's imposing his will in a way that could force the wife into a situation where she has to choose between her husband and her family. This could be seen as undermining her agency, especially if she's already conflicted and depressed by her family's influence.\n\nOn the other hand, the father-in-law's actions are a breach of the parents' agreement, and the author is trying to protect his son's upbringing. The wife might feel trapped between her husband and her family, and the author's ultimatum might be a way to enforce boundaries.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? By threatening divorce over this, he's using the threat of ending the marriage as leverage. That could be seen as extreme. The wife might not have the same level of commitment to the secular upbringing anymore, perhaps influenced by her family, but that doesn't mean she's wrong. However, the author's approach might not allow for compromise. Instead of working with the wife to address her family's pressure, he's taking a hardline stance that could lead to divorce regardless of her current feelings.\n\nIn terms of parental rights, both parents have a say, but the author is not allowing any input from his wife, who is the other parent. He's making the decision unilaterally, which could be problematic. The wife might need support rather than an ultimatum. Additionally, the father-in-law's involvement without consent is a separate issue, but the author's response targets the wife, not the father-in-law.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's approach might be seen as inconsiderate of the wife's autonomy and the complex dynamics with her family. While he has a right to his beliefs, using divorce as a threat to enforce them could be seen as the wrong approach. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
