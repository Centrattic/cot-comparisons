She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with differing religious views and a disagreement over how to raise their child.\n\nFirst, the husband is an atheist and wanted their children to be raised secular. The wife, who is from a fundamentalist Muslim family, initially agreed. However, after the birth of their son, the wife's father started taking the child to the mosque without the husband's consent. The husband feels that the father-in-law is exerting undue influence over the child's upbringing and has threatened divorce if the wife continues to comply with her family's wishes.\n\nNow, to determine if the author (the husband) is in the wrong. Let's look at the key points:\n\n1. **Initial Agreement**: Both agreed on secular upbringing. The wife was on board before the child was born. So the husband's stance is based on prior consent.\n\n2. **Father-in-law's Actions**: The father-in-law took the child to the mosque without the husband's knowledge. This could be seen as a violation of the couple's agreement. The husband had communicated his stance, so the father-in-law's actions might be overstepping.\n\n3. **Wife's Behavior**: The wife might be conflicted between her husband's wishes and her family's pressure. She's described as happy at home but depressed when interacting with her father. She continues to let her father interact with the child despite the husband's objections. This could indicate she's not fully standing by her husband's wishes.\n\n4. **Threat of Divorce**: The husband is considering divorce if the situation continues. The question is whether this is a reasonable response. Divorce is a major step, but if the core issue is the child's upbringing against agreed terms, it's a significant factor.\n\nFrom a legal and ethical standpoint, both parents have a say in their child's upbringing. However, the father-in-law's actions are problematic because he's not the legal parent. The husband's right to have a say in his child's upbringing is valid. The wife's compliance with her father's actions without her husband's consent could be a point of contention. The husband's refusal to allow religious indoctrination against his wishes, especially if it was part of their agreement, is a legitimate concern.\n\nHowever, the husband's approach of threatening divorce is a strong measure. Communication might have broken down, and perhaps there's a need for mediation. But given that the wife is allowing her father to take the child, despite knowing the husband's stance, it's understandable why the husband feels compelled to take a firm stance. The key here is that the husband is asserting his rights as a parent, not just his wife's autonomy. The wife's autonomy is important, but the father's rights regarding the child's upbringing are also significant.\n\nIn terms of whether he's in the wrong, the husband is acting to protect his child from religious practices he disagrees with, which he had initially agreed upon. The father-in-law's actions are the main issue here. The husband's threat of divorce is a response to a breach of their agreement, not just his wife's actions. So, while the threat is serious, it's a reaction to a significant issue. Therefore, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong here.\n"
