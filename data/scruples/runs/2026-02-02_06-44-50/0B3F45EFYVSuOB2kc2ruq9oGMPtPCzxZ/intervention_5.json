She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. Let's break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author is married to a woman from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They had agreed that their children would be raised secular unless the kids choose religion when they're older. The wife initially agreed. Now, the wife's father has taken their son to the mosque without the author's knowledge, dressing him in Muslim clothes. The author feels this is against his wishes and is threatening divorce if it continues.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. So, what's the key here? The main issue is about parental rights and autonomy in raising a child. In many places, both parents have equal rights, but the father is the one making the decision here. However, the mother is also a parent, and her family's influence is a factor.\n\nThe wife might be caught between her husband's secular views and her family's religious expectations. The father-in-law's actions are problematic because he's taking the child without consent. The author's threat to divorce is a serious move. But is it justified? If the parents can't agree on the child's upbringing, that's a significant conflict. However, threatening divorce over a single incident might be too extreme.\n\nAlso, the wife's behavior is a point. She agreed to secular upbringing but might be influenced by her family. The author's father-in-law is acting unilaterally, which is an overreach. The author is trying to protect his son from religion, but the approach might be confrontational. The author's stance is about his right to raise the child as he sees fit, but marriage requires compromise. If the wife is complicit in allowing her father to take the child, that's a problem. However, the author's response of divorce could be seen as harsh, especially if the issue can be resolved through communication or legal means.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, both parents must agree on major decisions about the child. If the father-in-law is acting without consent, that's illegal. But the author's main conflict is with his wife, whom he married knowing her family's stance. The author might believe he has the right to enforce his views, but marriage isn't a contract where you can void it over disagreements. The wife's autonomy is also a factor; the author can't control her actions entirely. However, if she's allowing her father to influence the child without the author's consent, that could be a breach of their agreement.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the context. If the wife is actively participating in the religious upbringing against her husband's wishes, then the author has a valid concern. But threatening divorce immediately might be an overreaction. On the other hand, if the wife isn't supporting her husband's stance and the father-in-law is acting independently, the author is protecting his son's upbringing. However, the way he's handling it\u2014threatening divorce\u2014could be seen as extreme. It's a complex situation with no clear right or wrong answer, but the author's approach might be part of the problem.\n"
