She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife over religious upbringing issues. \n\nFirst, the author is an atheist, married to a woman from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They had agreed that their children would be raised secularly. However, the wife's father is pressuring to raise the son as Muslim, even taking the child to the mosque without the author's knowledge. The author feels that his wife is not standing up to her family, and he's threatening divorce to prevent the son from being raised in the religion he dislikes.\n\nI need to consider legal, ethical, and relational aspects. Legally, parents have the right to raise their children in a certain religion, but both parents have equal rights. Since the author is a co-parent, his objection might be valid, but threatening divorce over it could be problematic. Ethically, respecting each other's beliefs is key in a marriage. The author's ultimatum might be seen as extreme, especially if the wife is conflicted. However, the father-in-law's actions without consent are concerning. \n\nThe wife's situation is complex too. She might be caught between her husband and her family, leading to stress and depression. The author's approach of threatening divorce might push her further into her family's influence or cause her emotional distress. It's possible that the author should seek mediation or counseling first rather than an ultimatum. But his stance on protecting his son's upbringing could be seen as justified from his perspective.\n\nIn terms of wrongdoings, the father-in-law's actions (taking the child without consent) are definitely problematic. The wife might not be actively supporting this, but her inaction could be part of the issue. The author's response, while firm, might be a reaction to a breach of their agreement. However, threatening divorce is a drastic measure. \n\nConsidering all factors, the answer might lean towards B (author not in the wrong) because he's standing up for his beliefs and the agreed-upon parenting plan. However, the method (divorce threat) is harsh. But since the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" and given the circumstances, the author's stance on protecting his son's upbringing could be seen as justified, making B the answer.\n"
