She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is an atheist married to a wife from an immigrant Muslim family. They agreed to raise their kids secularly, but now the author's father-in-law is taking their son to the mosque without permission. The author is threatening divorce if the wife continues to let this happen.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, both parents have equal rights in raising their children, but if there's a conflict over religious upbringing, courts usually consider the child's best interest. The author's wife might be under pressure from her family, which could be affecting her decisions. But since the wife is an adult, does she have the right to make her own choices, even if they go against the author's wishes? The author is saying he's okay with the child being Muslim when he's older but not being forced into it as a baby. \n\nThen there's the family dynamics. The wife's family doesn't like the author, which complicates things. The father-in-law's actions of taking the child to the mosque without consent could be an issue. The author is upset that his son is being exposed to religion without his agreement. But maybe the wife is conflicted because of her family's pressure, even though she initially agreed with the secular raising.\n\nThe author is using a threat of divorce, which is a serious step. Is it justified? If the wife is choosing to comply with her family's wishes despite their agreement, that could be a problem. But if the author is being controlling about the child's upbringing, that's another angle. The line between protecting the child's interests and being overly controlling is thin here. \n\nAlso, the wife's mental health is mentioned\u2014she gets depressed after seeing her father. Maybe the author should address the underlying issues in the marriage, like the wife's family pressure, rather than threatening divorce over the religious upbringing. However, if the author feels that his fundamental values about raising the child are being violated, he might see divorce as the only option.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, both parents can have different religious influences, but there's a limit on how much one parent can enforce their views. The father-in-law's actions might be overstepping, which the author is concerned about. The key is whether the wife is actively complicit in this, which could make the author's reaction more or less justified.\n\nI'm not sure if the author is entirely in the wrong. He's standing up for his beliefs and his child's upbringing, but his method of using a divorce threat might be too harsh. However, given the circumstances, it's a complex situation where both parties might have valid points. The wife might feel torn between her family and her husband, and the author is trying to protect his child's upbringing as agreed. Maybe there's a middle ground, but the author is seeing divorce as the only solution now. So maybe the answer is not clear-cut, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because he's protecting his child's upbringing as he agreed with his wife. However, the threat of divorce is a strong move. Alternatively, he might be wrong for not addressing the issue through other means first. Hmm.\n"
