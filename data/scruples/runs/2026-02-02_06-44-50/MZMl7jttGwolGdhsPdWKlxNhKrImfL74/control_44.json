Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the delivery driver is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and smells like weed. The situation is in a place where weed is illegal. The driver says the customer writes $0.00 in tips, not forgetting because they're high. The driver loses money on each delivery and relies on tips.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if reporting the customer is justified. The key points are the legality of weed, the customer's actions, and the driver's motivations. The customer is using illegal substances, which is a public concern. However, the driver's main grievance is the lack of tips and financial loss.\n\nThe driver's job is to deliver pizza, not to enforce laws. Reporting someone for smoking weed in their own home could be seen as overstepping. Unless the driver observed a crime in progress, like selling or manufacturing, just using it might not be reportable. Plus, the driver is using the customer's weed use as a reason to report them, which could be a pretext for the real issue being the tips.\n\nAlso, the customer is explicitly not tipping, which is their choice, even if it's frustrating. The driver's main issue is financial, but reporting for non-tipping isn't a legal issue. So, the driver is mixing personal grievances with potential illegal activity. If the driver's primary motivation is revenge for not getting tips, then it's wrong. But if there's a legitimate reason to believe the customer is breaking the law beyond just using weed, maybe not. However, the description doesn't mention other illegal activities. Just using an illegal substance in a legal sense. But in some places, even possession is illegal. However, if the customer is in their own home, it's unclear if the driver can report that. The driver isn't a law enforcer, so they can't just report people for personal reasons. So, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because their main motive is about the tips, not reporting a direct crime. They're using the weed as a reason, but the real issue is the tips. That's not their place to enforce the law for personal gain.\n"
