Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the delivery driver who wants to report a customer for smoking weed because they don't tip is in the wrong. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the driver is a delivery person relying on tips, which is common in such jobs. The customer isn't tipping, even though the service is good. The driver notices the customer is stoned and smells like weed. The question is whether reporting the customer for drug use (which is illegal) is justified here.\n\nNow, the key points. The driver has no issue with personal drug use in general but is upset because the customer isn't tipping. The customer is actually choosing to tip $0.00, not forgetting. The driver is losing money on each delivery to this customer because they're far away. So, the driver is considering reporting the customer for a possible drug offense.\n\nIs the driver in the wrong for doing that? Well, the customer's actions (using an illegal drug) might be a separate issue from the tipping. But the driver's motivation is financial gain. Reporting someone solely because they don't tip and are using drugs could be seen as using the law for personal benefit, which might not be right. Also, the driver might not have a clear legal basis to report someone for personal drug use unless there's a specific violation related to the delivery service. Maybe the customer is smoking after the delivery, which the driver isn't responsible for. \n\nThe driver's main grievance is about the tips, not the drug use. So if the driver is using the drug use as a pretext to report the customer to get money back via some means, that's probably wrong. Legally, unless the customer is doing something illegal during the delivery or interacting with the driver under the influence in a way that's violating a law (like driving under the influence, but that's a different scenario), the driver might not have a valid reason to report them. Also, the driver could be retaliating against the customer for not tipping, which is more about personal financial gain rather than upholding the law. \n\nBut on the other hand, if the customer is using an illegal drug, the driver might have a legal responsibility to report it. However, that's usually the case if they're committing a crime in public or if it's affecting the driver directly. If the customer is just smoking in their own home, the driver can't report that unless there's a specific law being broken. \n\nSo, the driver's main issue is the tips. Using the customer's drug use as a reason to report them for financial gain is likely using a legal argument as a pretext for a personal grievance. That makes the driver in the wrong because it's not about enforcing the law but about getting compensation for something they can't control (the customer's tipping behavior). The customer isn't required to tip, and the driver's income relies on that, but it's part of the job. Reporting someone for a crime (if applicable) should be for legitimate safety or legal reasons, not for financial gain. Therefore, the driver is in the wrong.\n"
