Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is a pizza delivery driver who hasn't received tips from a customer four times. Each time, the customer was clearly under the influence of marijuana, which is illegal where they live. The driver loses money on these deliveries because they're far, and their income relies heavily on tips. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering reporting the customer to the police.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. If marijuana is illegal in their location, then the customer could be breaking the law by possessing or using it. The driver is a delivery person, so entering the customer's home might be an issue. Wait, can a delivery driver report someone for smoking weed in their own home? That's a key point. Unless the driver has evidence of illegal activity occurring in a public space or if they were involved in selling it, the customer is probably just using it in private. In most places, private use is illegal but not something a third party like a delivery driver can easily report without probable cause. \n\nThen, the tip aspect. The customer isn't tipping, which affects the driver's income. The driver makes $5 an hour and relies on tips. Not tipping is unprofessional and against company policy, maybe? But should the driver report the customer for a different reason (smoking weed) just because they're upset about the tip? There's a conflict here between personal grievances and legal responsibility. \n\nThe driver's main job is to deliver food. They might not have a legal obligation to police the customers' drug use unless they have a reason to suspect illegal activity that they are required to report. But since the driver isn't a law enforcement officer, their role is to serve, not to report. \n\nAlso, the ethical side: is it right to report someone for a personal reason like not getting a tip? That could be seen as using a legal issue to get revenge on an unpaid tip. The customer's choice to not tip is one thing, but the driver's motivation might be questionable if it's driven by financial loss from the tip rather than genuine concern for the law.\n\nAnother angle: even if the customer is smoking weed, unless the driver has a way to prove it (like seeing it in a public place or being offered some), it's just a suspicion. False accusations can be problematic, so the driver should consider if they have valid evidence. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the driver's primary issue is the lack of tips. Using a potential illegal activity as a means to address that could be crossing a line. The driver isn't in the wrong for being concerned about their income, but reporting someone for drug use just because they didn't tip might not be justified. It's possible that the driver is conflating two separate issues. \n\nI think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. Reporting the customer for a personal financial reason, especially for a private activity that's not directly related to the service, is using a legal matter as retaliation. It's unethical and possibly a misuse of the legal system. Even though the customer isn't tipping, the driver's motivation here is not to uphold the law but to get a tip, which is not acceptable. The correct approach would be to address the tipping issue with the company or find another way to handle it without involving the police. So the author is in the wrong.\n"
