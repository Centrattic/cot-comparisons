Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is they're a pizza delivery driver, and a customer hasn't tipped them multiple times. The customer is always stoned and smells strongly of weed, which is illegal in their area. The author is considering reporting the customer because they have to make a living on tips and this delivery is far, costing them money each time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If weed is illegal where they live, then the customer using it would be breaking the law. The author is thinking about reporting this, which is within their rights as a citizen. But maybe the question is about whether they're justified in doing so for the reason of not getting tipped. \n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author is struggling with tips, which are crucial for their income. However, the main issue is the legality of the customer's actions. The customer isn't just forgetting to tip; they explicitly put $0.00. That's intentional. The author's job is to deliver the pizza, and they're being paid a base wage plus tips. So, the lack of tips is affecting their earnings.\n\nBut is reporting the customer for not tipping and for smoking weed a justified action? The author's main job is to deliver the pizza, not to police their customers. However, if the customer is openly breaking the law by using an illegal substance, the author might feel that they have a responsibility to report that. \n\nHowever, there's a possible conflict of interest here. The author is using the customer's illegal activity as a reason to report them, but maybe the real motive is the lack of tips. That could be seen as hypocritical, especially if the author is using the legal justification to get revenge for the tips. \n\nAlso, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If someone reports another person for a legitimate legal violation, they aren't necessarily in the wrong. But if they're doing it primarily for their own financial gain rather than public safety, that might be questionable. \n\nBut in this case, the customer is breaking the law by using an illegal substance. The author is not the one smoking weed; the customer is. So the author isn't in the wrong for reporting a legal violation. However, some might argue that the author is using the weed as an excuse to justify the report when the real issue is the lack of tips. \n\nBut the key point is the legality. If the customer is in possession of an illegal drug, then the author is not in the wrong for reporting that. It's a citizen's duty to report illegal activities. However, the author should ensure that their intent is to report the illegal activity, not just the lack of tips. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they are reporting a potential illegal act, even if the underlying reason is their own financial struggle with tips. The act of reporting illegal drug use is their responsibility as a law-abiding citizen, regardless of their personal circumstances.\n"
