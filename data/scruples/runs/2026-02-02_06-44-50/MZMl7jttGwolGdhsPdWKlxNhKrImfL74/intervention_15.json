Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the delivery driver who wants to report a customer for smoking weed is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the driver is upset because the customer didn't tip four times and smells like weed. They mention that the customer writes $0.00 in the tip section. The driver loses money on each delivery to this person and feels justified in reporting them because weed is illegal there. The question is whether the driver is in the wrong for wanting to report the customer.\n\nHmm, let's consider the legal aspect. If weed is indeed illegal in their area, then the customer could be breaking the law by smoking it. The driver isn't a police officer, but they might be reporting a potential illegal activity. However, the main issue here is the lack of tips. The driver relies on tips for income, and the customer is deliberately not tipping. But the driver is linking the tip issue to the weed use. Is it right to report someone just because they didn't tip?\n\nWait, the driver is using the weed as an excuse to report the customer. The core problem is the lack of tips, not the weed. If the driver is trying to get the customer to tip by threatening to report them, that's using a legal claim as leverage for personal gain. That might be unethical. Also, the driver might be overstepping by using a law enforcement tool for a non-urgent matter just because of a personal grievance.\n\nBut if the driver genuinely believes the customer is breaking the law by smoking weed, then reporting it isn't wrong. However, the main motivation here seems to be the tips and money lost. The driver is conflating two issues: the customer's personal choice (if it's legal or not) and their own financial loss. If the driver is doing this primarily for the tips, it's more of a personal vendetta, which could make them in the wrong.\n\nAlso, the customer might not be aware that they're supposed to tip, or maybe they have other reasons. The driver could have addressed the tipping issue directly instead of involving the police. Reporting someone for a legal infraction (if it's true) is their right, but if the primary motive is the tips, that's different. So, the driver's actions might not be legally wrong, but ethically, it's questionable because it's using the law to get back at someone for not tipping.\n"
