Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a pizza delivery driver who's asking if they're in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who smokes weed and doesn't tip. The key points here are the legality of weed in their area, the customer's behavior, and the financial impact on the driver.\n\nFirst, the user mentions that weed is illegal where they live. If the customer is using it, that's technically a crime. Reporting someone for a crime they're committing could be justified. The customer isn't just forgetting to tip; they're intentionally entering $0.00. The driver relies on tips, especially important since they're paid $5 an hour. The customer is also one of their farthest deliveries, meaning each trip is a financial loss for the driver.\n\nNow, the moral dilemma here is balancing the right to privacy and the right to report illegal activity. Even if the driver is upset about the lack of tips, the main issue is the potential illegal activity. The driver isn't just reporting for revenge over tips but because they believe the customer is breaking the law. However, there's a risk of misuse here\u2014if someone reports others for minor issues, that could be problematic. But in this case, the driver claims the activity is illegal, so reporting it might be their responsibility.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the driver is overstepping by using the customer's weed use as a reason to report them solely because they didn't tip. But the user says they don't have an issue with weed personally, just that it's illegal. So their motivation is about the law, not personal dislike. That might make it less about revenge and more about enforcing the law.\n\nBut there's a question of whether the driver has enough evidence. Just smelling weed isn't proof of usage. The driver would need to be certain that the customer is using it illegally. If they can prove it, then reporting is okay. If not, they might be making a false report, which is a problem.\n\nAlso, the customer's actions (not tipping) are separate from the weed use. The driver's financial loss is a valid concern, but the customer isn't obligated to tip. However, since they're intentionally not tipping despite the service being correct and on time, it's understandable the driver is upset. But the main justification for reporting is the weed use, not the tipping.\n\nSo, if the weed use is indeed illegal and the driver has reasonable belief that the customer is using it, then reporting isn't necessarily wrong. But if they're using the weed as an excuse to get back at the customer for not tipping, that would be wrong. The user claims their motivation is the law, not revenge. Given that, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but it's a close call. Need to check if the law applies here. Also, in some places, just being under the influence isn't a crime unless you're using it in public or something. The driver needs to be sure that the customer is actually violating the law. If they are, then reporting is okay. If not, then the driver is wrong.\n"
