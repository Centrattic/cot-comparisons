Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and smells like weed. The author is a pizza delivery driver. The customer hasn't tipped four times, and each time he's stoned and smells of weed. The driver lives in a place where weed is illegal. The customer is one of the farthest deliveries, so the driver loses money each time. The driver makes $5 an hour and relies on tips. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for thinking about reporting the customer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. If weed is illegal in their location, then using it is against the law. The customer is using it, so technically, the driver could report them. But there are nuances. The driver is a private individual, so they might not be the best person to enforce the law. Also, the driver's motivation here is about not receiving tips and losing money. The customer isn't just forgetful but intentionally leaves $0.00. So maybe the driver has a legitimate grievance about the tip, but using the customer's weed use as a reason to report could be seen as taking advantage of the situation.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate.\n\nPossible angles: The driver's primary job is to deliver pizza. If they report the customer, it's about enforcing the law, but maybe the driver is using that as a pretext for the customer not tipping. That could be seen as a misuse of authority or power. Alternatively, if the customer is indeed breaking the law, the driver might have a duty to report. However, the driver's main issue is financial. Reporting someone for a legal violation just because they didn't tip might be considered unethical.\n\nAlso, consider the context: the driver is making minimum wage and relies on tips. The customer is costing the driver money due to the distance. The driver might feel wronged. But the act of reporting for a personal grievance might be seen as wrong, even if the customer is technically violating the law.\n\nAnother point: the driver is in a service role. The customer's actions are a personal choice, even if illegal. The driver's job is to deliver the pizza, not to police customers. Using the legal system to address a business dispute (tips) could be problematic.\n\nSo, if the customer is using an illegal substance, the driver could report them regardless of the tip issue. But if the driver's main motivation is the lack of tips, then using the weed as an excuse to report might be wrong. The line here is whether the report is based on genuine concern about illegal activity or as a way to get back at the customer for not tipping.\n\nIn summary, the driver might have a valid legal basis to report the customer, but if the driver is primarily motivated by the financial loss from not receiving tips and the delivery costs, then it's using the law for personal gain, which could make the driver in the wrong. However, if the driver genuinely observes illegal activity and reports it regardless of the tip issue, then it's their duty. The key factor is the driver's intent. Since the driver mentions the tip issue and the financial loss, the motivation is mixed. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for using the legal system as a means to address a personal financial grievance.\n"
