Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a delivery driver who hasn't received tips from a customer multiple times. The customer smells like weed and is obviously stoned each time. The user is considering reporting them to the police because weed is illegal where they live. They mention that the customer intentionally leaves a $0.00 tip, not just forgetting. The user relies on tips since they make $5 an hour.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is whether reporting someone for smoking weed is justified. Even if it's illegal, the user's motivation is financial gain. The user is in a service job and the customer is not tipping. But the user is using the legal status of weed as a reason to report them. However, the customer's failure to tip might be a separate issue. Legally, not tipping isn't a crime, but the user is trying to leverage the weed use as a legal action.\n\nBut wait, if the customer is using illegal substances, then technically, the user could report them for that. But the user's primary grievance is the lack of tips. The user is using the weed as a reason to report them, but maybe their main issue is the lack of tips. Also, the user is in a position where they have to deliver to someone far away, which costs them money, adding to their frustration.\n\nHowever, the user is in a gray area. Reporting someone for illegal activity is their right, but if their main motive is to get tipped more, it might be seen as using the law for personal gain. The customer's weed use is a separate issue from tipping. The user could be in the wrong if they are using the weed as a pretext to retaliate against not getting tips. Alternatively, if the customer is indeed using an illegal substance, the user is within their rights to report that, regardless of the tipping issue.\n\nBut the key point is the user's intent. If the user's primary reason is financial, then they might be in the wrong. If they genuinely believe the customer is breaking the law and want to report them for that, it's more justified. However, since the user mentions that they don't have a problem with weed personally, their real motive is about the tips. So, using the illegal activity as a means to get paid more could be considered using the law for personal gain, making the user the asshole.\n\nAlso, consider the ethical angle. The user is in a service role, and the customer's choice to use weed is their own, even if it's illegal. The user is taking advantage of that situation to report them for a personal financial reason. That seems unethical. The user's main issue is not the weed but the lack of tips. Therefore, the user is likely in the wrong.\n"
