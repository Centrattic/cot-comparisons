Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're in the wrong for considering reporting a customer to the police for smoking weed. The customer hasn't tipped them four times, and the driver thinks the customer is stoned each time, smelling like weed. The driver is losing money on those deliveries and relies on tips.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality of weed in the area. If it's illegal, then the customer could be breaking the law. But the driver isn't a law enforcement officer. Their job is to deliver pizza, not to enforce laws. So even if the customer is smoking weed, is it the driver's responsibility to report that?\n\nThen there's the tipping issue. The customer consistently puts $0.00 in the tip. The driver mentions making $5 an hour and depending on tips. That's a valid concern. But how does the tipping relate to the weed? The driver is upset about not getting tipped, but they're considering reporting the customer for a different reason. Is there a connection here?\n\nWait, maybe the driver is trying to get revenge for not getting tips by reporting the customer for smoking weed. If the customer is indeed using a legal substance where it's legal, but the driver's area considers it illegal, then technically the customer is violating a law. However, in some places, recreational weed is legal. The user says it's illegal where they live, so we can take that as given.\n\nBut the driver's role is to deliver food. They might not have the authority to report people just because they smell like weed. Also, the customer isn't doing anything illegal during the delivery; they're just using weed at home. The driver isn't witnessing the act, just the smell when delivering. So maybe it's a privacy issue. The driver isn't in the customer's home to see them using it, just detecting the smell through the door.\n\nAlso, the driver is losing money on those deliveries. That's a separate issue. Maybe they should address the delivery cost with their employer or the customer, but using the weed as a reason to report seems like a stretch. The driver's main grievance is the lack of tips, and they're using the weed as a justification for reporting. That could be seen as using a legal technicality to get back at someone for not tipping.\n\nSo, is the driver in the wrong? If they're using the weed as a pretext to report someone for not tipping, that's unethical. But if they genuinely believe the customer is breaking the law and report it in good faith, maybe not. But in most cases, reporting someone for a personal grievance like not getting tips might be considered wrong. The driver's main issue is with the tips, not the weed. They might be seeking a way to get back at the customer, which is not appropriate. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
