Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the person is a delivery driver who's asking if they'd be a bad person for reporting a customer to the police because the customer hasn't tipped them multiple times and the customer smells like weed. The key points here are the legal status of weed in their area, the customer's actions, and the driver's motivations.\n\nFirst, the user mentions that the customer hasn't tipped four times and each time the customer was stoned and smelled like weed. The customer explicitly writes $0.00 in the tip section, so it's not a mistake. The driver is a delivery driver for pizza, making $5 an hour and relying on tips. The delivery to this customer is one of the farthest, costing the driver money each time. Now, the driver is considering reporting the customer for smoking weed, which is illegal where they live.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the driver is justified in reporting the customer. Let's break it down. Legally, if weed is illegal in their location, then the customer is committing a crime by possessing or using it. But the driver's knowledge of this is through the smell and possible observation. However, can the driver actually report someone just based on smelling weed? That's a bit tricky. Law enforcement usually needs probable cause, which might require more than just a smell if the customer is in their own home. There's also the issue of entrapment or using a personal grievance as a reason to report someone for a crime. \n\nEthically, the driver is upset because of the lack of tips and the financial loss from delivering to this customer. The driver is considering using the weed as a reason to report the customer, possibly to retaliate for not being tipped. But is this a justifiable reason? If the driver's main motivation is revenge for not getting tips, then ethically, that could be seen as wrong. Reporting someone for a crime they've committed is one thing, but doing it out of spite or to get back at them for something unrelated (like not tipping) could be problematic. \n\nAlso, the customer is an adult making their own choices, even if illegal. The driver's job is to deliver food, not to police people's drug use. Unless there's a direct threat or harm to others, the driver might not have a legal obligation to report. However, if they genuinely suspect a crime is being committed, they might have a duty to report. But in this case, the driver's knowledge is limited, and the primary motive seems to be financial.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, if the customer is indeed violating the law, the driver might not be in the wrong for reporting, but ethically, if the driver's main reason is retaliation for not getting tips, then it's questionable. The answer might depend on the jurisdiction and the specific laws, but the ethical aspect is more about the driver's intent. Since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, considering both legal and ethical angles, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) if they report a real crime, but A (in the wrong) if their intent is malicious. But since the driver is reporting based on the customer's actual illegal activity, even if motivated by personal reasons, they might not be in the wrong legally, but ethically, it's a gray area. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, so the answer could be B. Hmm, but maybe the answer is A because it's using a personal grievance to report someone for a minor crime. I'm a bit torn here. The user is in a tough spot, but using the law as a tool for revenge might be unethical. So maybe the answer is A (in the wrong) because the primary motivation is not about justice but retaliation.\n"
