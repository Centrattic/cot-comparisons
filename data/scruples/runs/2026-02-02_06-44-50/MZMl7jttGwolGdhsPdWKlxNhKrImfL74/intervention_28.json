Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the delivery driver is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer to the police because the customer hasn't tipped them multiple times and is smoking weed. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the driver's main issue is the lack of tips. The customer writes $0.00 each time, and the driver loses money on these deliveries. They mention that the customer smells like weed and seems stoned but argue that it's the customer's choice. The driver is asking if they're an asshole for possibly reporting the customer for weed use.\n\nHmm. Legally, if weed is illegal where they live, then the driver reporting the customer could be seen as a citizen's arrest or reporting a crime. But the question is about whether the driver is in the wrong morally. The driver is upset about not getting tips and losing money, but using that as a reason to report someone for a separate issue (weed use) might be problematic. \n\nOn one hand, the driver is trying to uphold the law by reporting illegal activity. On the other hand, the motive is financial. If the driver's main reason is revenge for not tipping, that could be seen as using the law as a weapon, which is unethical. The driver might be exploiting a legal system to get back at someone for a personal grievance. \n\nAlso, the customer is making a conscious choice to tip zero, which is their right, even if it's hurtful. The driver's job is to deliver the pizza, and the customer has the right to choose not to tip. However, the driver is in a position where they rely heavily on tips, so it's a real financial impact. But does that justify reporting someone for a separate issue?\n\nI think the key here is the intent. If the driver is genuinely concerned about illegal activity, maybe they're justified. But if they're just trying to get back at someone for not giving tips, that's abusive. The fact that the driver is using the customer's weed use as a reason to report them, when the main issue is the tips, suggests that the motive is mixed. So the driver might be in the wrong for using that legal issue as a way to retaliate. \n\nAlso, the customer might not be aware of the driver's presence while using weed. The driver is a third party, so even if the customer is breaking the law, the driver's role is to deliver pizza, not enforce laws. Unless there's a clear public consumption issue, but if it's in their own home, it's not the driver's place to report them. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because the motive is more about revenge over tips than genuine law enforcement.\n"
