Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a delivery driver who wants to report a customer for smoking weed because they didn't tip multiple times. The customer is always stoned and smells like weed, and the user thinks it's illegal where they live. The user is considering reporting them to the police.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for considering reporting the customer. Let's look at the facts. The customer hasn't given any tips, which affects the user's income. The user makes $5 an hour and relies on tips. The customer writes $0.00 in the tip section, so it's intentional. The user is losing money on each delivery to this customer, which adds up.\n\nNow, the customer is smoking weed, which is a state where it's illegal. The user is reporting them for that reason. But is the user justified in doing so? The user's primary grievance is the lack of tips, not the weed use itself. They might be using the weed as an excuse to report the customer. The customer's actions (smoking weed) are a personal choice, even if illegal, and the user's role is to deliver the pizza, not to enforce laws. \n\nHowever, if the user believes the customer is breaking the law (using illegal substances), they might feel compelled to report them. But the user's main motivation is financial\u2014receiving tips. The user is using the weed as a justification for reporting someone who doesn't tip. That could be seen as using a legal issue as a pretext for a personal grievance. \n\nOn the other hand, the user is within their rights to report a potential law violation. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. If the user's primary intent is to get the customer to tip, then they might be misusing the reporting process. The user's actions could be considered unethical or an abuse of power because they're targeting someone for a legal issue that might not be their concern, especially when the main issue is the lack of tips. \n\nAlso, the user makes it clear they don't have a problem with weed personally, but they see it as illegal. However, the customer's actions (not tipping) are separate from the weed use. The user is conflating the two. The user's motivation is financial, not legal enforcement. \n\nIn terms of ethics, using a legal justification to report someone for a personal grievance could be seen as wrong. The user should address the tipping issue directly, maybe through their employer or customer service, rather than involving the police. Reporting someone to the police for not tipping is a misuse of the system and could be considered an asshole move because it's taking advantage of the situation for personal gain. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their primary motivation is financial and they're using the weed as an excuse, which is not a valid reason to report someone to the police.\n"
