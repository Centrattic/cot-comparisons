Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the delivery driver is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and is smoking weed.\n\nFirst, the main points: The driver is a delivery person, the customer hasn't tipped four times, and each time the customer is under the influence of weed, which is illegal in their area. The driver feels they lose money on these deliveries because it's a far location. They're considering reporting the customer to the police for smoking weed, even though they personally don't have an issue with it themselves.\n\nSo, the question is whether the driver is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong and wants to know if others agree.\n\nLet's break it down. The key factors here are the legality of the situation and the driver's motives. The customer is breaking the law by using an illegal substance. The driver's primary concern is not getting tipped, but they're thinking of reporting the customer for the drug use. \n\nNow, if the driver's main motive is revenge for not getting tips, that could be a problem. But if they're genuinely concerned about illegal activity and reporting it as a citizen's duty, maybe not. However, the driver is using their position to report someone based on their own financial grievances. \n\nAlso, is the driver allowed to report someone just because they suspect drug use? If the customer is in their home, the police might not get involved unless there's a clear violation observed. The driver might be overstepping by using their job as a reason to report someone for not tipping them. \n\nThe customer is clearly choosing not to tip, which is their right. The driver can't force a tip. However, the drug use is illegal. But does the driver have the right to report someone just because they're not getting a tip? That seems like a conflict of interest. The driver might be misusing their role as a delivery person to report someone for a reason unrelated to the service itself, which is about tips. \n\nAlso, the driver might be violating the customer's privacy. If the customer is using something illegal in their own home, is the driver in a position to report them? Unless there's visible evidence of illegal activity beyond the smell, which might not be enough for the police to act. \n\nSo, the driver's intention might be more about retaliation for the lack of tips rather than a genuine concern for the law. That would make the driver in the wrong because they're using an illegal activity as a pretext for their own grievances. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because their primary motive is revenge and financial gain, not a legitimate report of illegal activity.\n"
