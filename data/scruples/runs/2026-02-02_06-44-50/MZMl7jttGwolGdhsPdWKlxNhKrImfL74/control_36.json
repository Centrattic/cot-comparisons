Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a delivery driver who hasn't received tips from a customer multiple times. The customer smells like weed and seems stoned when they get the pizza. The driver is wondering if reporting the customer for smoking weed is the right move.\n\nFirst, the key points here are: the customer not tipping, the driver losing money on the delivery (since it's a far location), and the customer possibly using illegal substances. The driver's wage is $5 an hour, so tips are crucial for their income. \n\nNow, the question is whether the driver is in the wrong by considering reporting the customer. Legally, if the customer is smoking weed where it's illegal, the driver might have a right to report it. However, the main issue is the motivation. The driver's primary grievance is the lack of tips and financial loss, not necessarily the illegal activity. \n\nEven if the customer is using weed, unless the driver has evidence that the customer is doing so in a place where it's prohibited, reporting it might be a stretch. The driver might be using the weed as an excuse to retaliate against the customer for not tipping. \n\nAlso, the ethical angle: is it right to report someone for something that's a personal choice (assuming it's allowed in some places, but the user says it's illegal there)? If it's illegal, then technically it's a crime, so maybe the driver isn't wrong. But if the driver's main motive is to get tips, that could be seen as using the law for personal gain, which is questionable.\n\nHowever, since the customer is intentionally not tipping (writing $0.00), the driver's anger is justified. But using the illegal activity as a reason to report them could be seen as taking the law into their own hands for personal benefit. \n\nIn some places, you can't report someone just because you want them to tip you. So even if the customer is using weed, the driver's intent might make the report malicious. Therefore, the driver could be in the wrong for using that as a reason to report. \n\nSo the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because the motivation is not about illegal activity but about tips, and using the drug use as a pretext to retaliate.\n"
