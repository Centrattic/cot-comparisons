Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the delivery driver is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and is smoking weed.\n\nFirst, the main points: the driver is a delivery person for pizza. The customer hasn't tipped four times, and each time the customer was high on weed. The driver is concerned about losing money on these deliveries because it's a long route. The customer intentionally writes $0.00, not forgetting. The driver is making $5 an hour and relies on tips.\n\nThe driver's reasoning is that since weed is illegal in their location, reporting the customer would be justified. But the question is whether the driver is in the wrong for that.\n\nHmm. Legally, if the customer is using or smoking an illegal substance, the driver might think they have a right to report it. However, the driver's personal financial gain is the motive here. The driver is using the illegal activity as a reason not to tolerate the customer, but the primary issue is the lack of tips. So the driver might be using the weed as an excuse to justify reporting the customer for not tipping.\n\nBut wait, the customer is violating the law by using an illegal substance. Even if the driver is upset about the tips, if they believe the customer is breaking the law, they might have a right to report it. However, the driver's main complaint is about the tips, not the weed. So maybe the driver is using the weed as a reason to avoid dealing with a customer who isn't tipping, which is a separate issue.\n\nIn some places, the police might not prioritize such reports, especially if it's a civil matter. Also, the driver could be seen as using the law to their advantage rather than focusing on their own job responsibilities. The driver's job is to deliver the pizza, not to police customers' personal habits unless it's a direct violation that affects their work.\n\nAnother angle: the driver is in a service job and might have a responsibility to serve all customers, regardless of personal issues. Reporting someone for personal use of an illegal substance could be seen as overstepping, especially if the driver's main issue is the lack of tips. The driver's financial situation is tough, but using that as a reason to report someone for something that's a personal choice (even if illegal) could be considered unethical.\n\nAlso, the customer is making a conscious choice to not tip, which is their right, but it's a financial issue for the driver. However, the driver shouldn't take personal matters to the authorities unless there's a genuine threat or illegal activity. Since the customer is using an illegal substance, but the driver is using that as a way to avoid a financial loss, it's a conflict of motives.\n\nSo, considering all that, the driver's primary motive is financial gain, using the illegal activity as a justification. That could make the driver in the wrong for using the law to their advantage rather than focusing on their job. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
