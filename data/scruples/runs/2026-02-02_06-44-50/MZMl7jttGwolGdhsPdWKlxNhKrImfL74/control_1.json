Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer to the police for smoking weed, especially since the customer hasn't tipped them multiple times.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author is a delivery driver who delivers to a customer who smells like weed each time and writes $0.00 as a tip. The author loses money on each delivery because it's a far location. They don't have a problem with weed personally but point out it's illegal where they live. The main issue is whether reporting the customer is justified.\n\nNow, the key points here are legality and personal ethics. In the US, for example, marijuana's legality varies by state. If it's illegal in the author's location, then technically, the customer could be breaking the law by being under its influence. However, the author's role is as a delivery driver, not law enforcement. Their job isn't to enforce laws but to provide a service.\n\nThen there's the motivation. The author is upset about not receiving tips, which is a valid concern. But using the illegality of weed as a reason to report someone because of a lack of tips might be seen as using the law for personal gain. That's ethically questionable. The author might be conflating two separate issues: the customer's choice (which is their right if allowed) and the tipping issue.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the customer writes $0.00, indicating they intentionally don't tip, not that they forgot. The author's financial situation is tough, making $5/hour plus tips. But reporting someone for a non-violent, legal (in some places) activity just because they didn't tip could be seen as crossing a line. The author isn't being paid for law enforcement duties, so taking on that role might not be appropriate.\n\nHowever, if weed is indeed illegal where they live, the customer is technically violating the law. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for reporting. If the author is just informing the police about a possible law violation, they might not be in the wrong factually. But ethically, using it as a means to get money back from the customer could be seen as wrong.\n\nAnother angle: the author's responsibility. They aren't responsible for enforcing laws outside their job scope. Their job is to deliver food, not to police customers. So even if the customer is breaking the law, the author's role doesn't extend to that.\n\nAlso, the author's personal gain vs. public good. Reporting a crime is generally a civic duty, but if the primary motivation is personal gain (getting tips), it's a conflict of interest. The police might question the report's legitimacy if it's self-serving.\n\nIn some places, just being under the influence in public isn't a crime unless it's affecting others or causing a disturbance. The customer might just be using weed in their home, which is legal in some states. So the author's understanding of the law is crucial here.\n\nSo, if in the author's jurisdiction, being under the influence of weed isn't illegal, then the report is unfounded. If it is illegal, then technically the author isn't wrong to report, but ethically there's a problem because the motivation is about tips.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer would depend on legal vs. ethical considerations. Legally, maybe not, but ethically, they are because of the ulterior motive. Since the question is about being in the wrong in terms of behavior, not legal consequences, the answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because using someone's legal (or possibly legal) activity as a reason to report them for a personal financial gain is unethical.\n"
