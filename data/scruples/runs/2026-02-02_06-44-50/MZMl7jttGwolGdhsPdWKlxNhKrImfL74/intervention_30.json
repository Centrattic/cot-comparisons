Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this situation. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they'd be in the wrong for reporting a customer who doesn't tip them and is often high on weed. The key points here are the lack of tipping, the customer's drug use, and the financial implications for the driver.\n\nFirst, the driver mentions that the customer hasn't tipped four times, and each time the customer was visibly under the influence of weed. The driver loses money on these deliveries because the customer is far away. The driver's income is partly dependent on tips, which is a common structure for delivery jobs.\n\nNow, the main question is whether reporting the customer for drug use is justified. The driver isn't upset about the customer using weed personally, just that it's illegal in their area. However, the driver is considering reporting the customer for not tipping, which is essentially a business transaction issue, and tying that to the customer's drug use. \n\nBut here's the catch: drug use is a criminal matter, but the driver's motivation here might be more about the lack of tips than the drug use itself. The driver is using the drug use as a reason to report the customer, which could be seen as a pretext. The customer's choice to use an illegal substance doesn't directly affect the driver's work, except in the context of not tipping. However, the driver is conflating two separate issues: the customer's legal status (using an illegal drug) and their business transaction (not tipping). \n\nIn many places, it's illegal to use cannabis, so the customer could be in the wrong. But the driver's intent to report the customer is driven by the financial impact from not receiving tips. This could be seen as using the law to settle a dispute over a service, which is inappropriate. The driver's job is to deliver food, and the customer's decision not to tip is a separate issue from their drug use. \n\nAdditionally, the driver has to consider the ethics of using someone's drug use against them in a business context. Even if the customer is breaking the law, the driver is an employee and not law enforcement. Reporting someone for a non-violent, personal choice (albeit illegal) to settle a financial grievance might not be the right approach. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the customer's actions not affecting the driver's service. The driver delivers on time and correctly, so the customer's drug use doesn't interfere with the service quality. The customer's lack of tipping is a business practice, but the driver has to find a way to address that without involving other illegal activities. \n\nIn terms of the law, the driver might have grounds to report the customer for drug use, but the intent here is questionable. The driver is using the drug use as a justification for a personal financial grievance, which could be seen as retaliatory. \n\nSo, while the customer is in the wrong for not tipping and using an illegal substance, the driver's decision to report them for the drug use is driven by the financial loss from not receiving tips. This makes the driver's action a misuse of the legal system for a personal dispute. Therefore, the driver is in the wrong for using the customer's drug use as a means to address a tipping issue.\n"
