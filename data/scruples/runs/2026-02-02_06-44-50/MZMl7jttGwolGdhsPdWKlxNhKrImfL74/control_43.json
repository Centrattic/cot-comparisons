Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they'd be in the wrong for reporting a customer to the police for smoking weed, especially since the customer hasn't tipped them multiple times.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the legality of weed where they live and the motivation behind the report. The user mentions that weed is illegal in their area. If the customer is smoking it, that's a potential crime. But the user's main issue seems to be about the lack of tips and personal financial loss from delivering to a far location. \n\nNow, the question is whether the user is justified in reporting the customer. Legally, if the customer is using an illegal substance, the user might have a duty to report it. But the user's primary motive here appears to be the unpaid tips and financial loss. They mention that the customer intentionally writes $0.00, not forgetting. So, the user is considering using the weed as an excuse to report someone they're already upset with over tips. \n\nEthically, this is tricky. Reporting someone for a crime they're committing (smoking illegal weed) is one thing, but using that as a means to get revenge for not getting tips is another. The user might be exploiting the situation for personal gain, which could be seen as a misuse of their right to report crimes. \n\nAlso, in many places, you can't report someone solely for a civil matter (like not tipping) but if there's a criminal aspect (illegal drug use), that's different. However, the user's main grievance is the lack of tips, which isn't a crime. So, using the weed as a pretext to address the tip issue could be considered wrong. \n\nAdditionally, the user's financial situation\u2014making $5/hour and relying on tips\u2014adds context. They might feel desperate, but using a legal report as a tool for financial compensation is problematic. It could lead to legal or ethical consequences if the report is found to be motivated by personal vendetta rather than genuine concern for the law.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, the user isn't in the wrong if the customer is indeed violating the law. But ethically, using the report as a means to retaliate for not getting tips makes the user's actions questionable. The primary motivation here is the financial loss from tips, not the illegal activity. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong because they're using a legal issue to address a personal grievance, which isn't appropriate.\n"
