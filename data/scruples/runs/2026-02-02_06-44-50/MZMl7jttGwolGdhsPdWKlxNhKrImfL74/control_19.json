Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're an asshole for reporting a customer to the police because the customer didn't tip and smells like weed. The customer has missed tipping four times, and each time they're high and smell strongly of marijuana. The driver is making minimum wage plus tips, and this customer is a far delivery, costing them money each time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. The user mentions that weed is illegal in their area. If the customer is using it, that's technically against the law. The driver is considering reporting them for that, not for not tipping. So the main question here is whether reporting someone for a legal violation is justified, even if there's personal financial motivation involved.\n\nThe user's main issue is the lack of tips, but they're using the weed as the reason to report. The customer isn't just forgetting tips; they're intentionally entering $0.00. The driver is relying on tips to make a living, which is a legitimate concern. However, the decision to report someone to the police is a serious one. Even if the customer is breaking the law, the driver might be using that as a way to address the tip issue, which could cross a line.\n\nOn one hand, the driver has a right to enforce the law if they believe someone is violating it. But on the other hand, if their primary motivation is to get the customer to tip more or to avoid delivering to them, it might be seen as using the law for personal gain. That could make them an asshole because they're exploiting the legal system for their own benefit rather than acting out of genuine concern for the law.\n\nAlso, the customer's use of weed is a personal choice and a medical/legal issue. The driver isn't a police officer, so it's not their responsibility to enforce the law. Reporting someone for using an illegal substance when the main grievance is about tips could be seen as a misuse of authority. Plus, the customer's choice to use weed is their own, even if it's against the law in that area. The driver might be overstepping by reporting them for a personal issue.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because their primary motivation is personal financial gain rather than upholding the law. They're using a legal violation as a pretext to address their own grievances about tips, which is not ethical. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
