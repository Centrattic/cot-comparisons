Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is a delivery driver who hasn't been tipped by a customer four times. They suspect the customer is smoking weed, which is illegal where they live. They want to report the customer for that.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. So, the main points here are about the legality of the situation and the ethics of reporting someone for something else. \n\nWeed's legality is a key factor. If it's illegal in their area, then the customer could be breaking the law. But the driver is considering reporting them based on the smell and the customer writing $0.00 in tips. However, the customer not tipping is a separate issue. The driver is upset because they lose money on these deliveries and the customer isn't leaving a tip. But does that justify reporting them for a possible law violation?\n\nWait, the customer might not actually be committing a crime. The driver is assuming the customer is stoned because of the smell and the zero tips. But the police would need evidence that the customer is using an illegal substance. Just smelling weed might not be enough for a report. Also, the customer could be using it in a way that's allowed, like in a private space where it's legal. But the author says it's illegal where they live, so maybe the customer is violating that.\n\nBut reporting someone for a possible law violation they aren't sure of\u2014could that be considered a misuse of the law? Also, the driver's main grievance is about the tips. They mention they make $5 an hour and rely on tips. So maybe their motivation is financial, not just upholding the law. That could be a conflict of interest. \n\nIf the customer isn't actually breaking the law, then the driver is using the police to get what they want, which could be seen as wrong. So, even if the customer is using weed, is the driver overstepping by reporting them for something that might not affect others (since it's in their home)? \n\nAlso, the customer might have the right to privacy. The driver is entering their home, so maybe they can smell the weed, but is that enough to report? Or is that an invasion of privacy? \n\nSo, the author's actions could be based on a personal grievance (not getting tips) and using the law as a tool to address that, which might not be ethical. Even if the customer is breaking the law, the driver's primary role isn't to enforce laws but to deliver pizza. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because they are using the police for a personal issue rather than a public safety concern. But I need to check if the law allows for citizens to report such things. If it's legal to report, then maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, if the report is based on a hunch and not evidence, then it's a misuse. \n\nThe answer depends on whether the report is a legitimate use of the law or an abuse for personal gain. Since the driver is motivated by both financial loss and the customer's possible illegal activity, it's a mix. But the main question is if the author is in the wrong. If they report based on insufficient evidence and personal gain, then yes. If they report because they believe a crime is happening, even if it's not confirmed, it's a bit tricky. \n\nI think the consensus would be that using the law for personal grievances is wrong, so the author is in the wrong.\n"
