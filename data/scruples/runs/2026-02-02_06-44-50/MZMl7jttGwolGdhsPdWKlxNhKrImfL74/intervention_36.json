Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and smells of weed.\n\nFirst, the author is a delivery driver who makes $5 an hour and depends on tips. The customer never tips and is high on weed, which is illegal in their area. The author is considering reporting them for drug use.\n\nI need to consider a few things. Legally, can the author report someone for smoking weed? If weed is illegal where they live, then maybe. But the author isn't a police officer. They can report suspicious activity, but would the police act on that? It might depend on local laws and how reports are handled.\n\nEthically, the author is mad because of the lack of tips. They lost money on each delivery. But is it right to report someone for not tipping? The author's main grievance is the lack of tips, and the weed use is the reason they're considering reporting. There's a conflict of interest here. The author's motivation is financial, which could be seen as using a legal issue as a tool for personal gain.\n\nAlso, the customer is explicitly writing $0.00 in the tip. So it's intentional, not a mistake. The author might feel justified because the customer isn't respecting their work. But is it appropriate to take that to the police? That could be seen as an overreach. The author isn't in the wrong legally if they're reporting a crime, but ethically, mixing personal financial gain with reporting a legal violation might be problematic.\n\nAnother angle: the author isn't directly observing the customer using weed. They just smell it and assume. Could that be enough for a report? Maybe not. Police might need more evidence. The author is making an assumption based on odor, which might not be conclusive.\n\nAlso, the author's primary job is to deliver pizza. Reporting a customer for a possible drug offense is beyond their role. It's a gray area. If the author is just reporting because they're upset about the tips, that's using a legal system for a personal issue, which is unethical. But if they genuinely suspect illegal activity, they might have a moral obligation to report. However, the main driver here seems to be the financial aspect.\n\nSo putting it all together: Legally, the author might not be in the wrong if the customer is actually violating the law. But ethically, using the legal system to get back at someone for not tipping is wrong. The author's main motivation is their own financial loss, so reporting under those circumstances is likely unethical. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong ethically, even if not legally).\n"
