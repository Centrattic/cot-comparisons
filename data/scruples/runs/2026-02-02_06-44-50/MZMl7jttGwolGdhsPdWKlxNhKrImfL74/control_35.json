Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're in the wrong for considering reporting a customer to the police. The customer hasn't tipped them multiple times, and the driver noticed the customer is high on weed each time. The driver mentions that the customer writes $0.00 in the tip section, not forgetting. The driver makes $5 an hour and relies on tips. The main question is whether the driver is in the wrong by reporting the customer for smoking weed, which is illegal in their area.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If weed is illegal where they live, then using or possessing it is against the law. However, the driver is a private individual\u2014can they report someone just for smoking weed? The police might not take a report from a civilian without evidence unless there's a crime happening. The driver might not have concrete proof, just the smell and maybe seeing the customer under the influence. Reporting someone for a non-violent, personal activity might be overstepping, even if it's illegal. Also, the driver's motivation is about the lack of tips and financial loss. That could be seen as using the law as a tool for personal gain, which is problematic.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The customer isn't causing harm beyond their own actions. The driver is losing tips, but is that a valid reason to report someone for a legal (or in this case illegal, but maybe decriminalized in some areas) activity? Plus, the driver's job is delivery, so maybe they should focus on their work rather than the customer's personal habits. Also, the customer's choice to not tip is one thing, but the driver's response might be disproportionate.\n\nOn the other hand, the driver is struggling financially and relying on tips, which is a real issue. However, using illegal activities as a reason to report someone for not tipping seems like a stretch. The appropriate action would be to address the lack of tips through their employer, if possible, rather than involving the police over a civil matter. So the driver might be in the wrong for considering a criminal report for a non-criminal issue related to their job. The wrong here is mixing personal grievances with potential misuse of the legal system.\n"
