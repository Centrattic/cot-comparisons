Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is a delivery driver asking if they're an asshole for reporting a customer who doesn't tip and smells like weed. The customer hasn't tipped four times, and the user loses money on each delivery. The user isn't against weed personally but thinks it's illegal there. The customer writes $0.00 in tips, so it's not a mistake.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: reporting someone for not tipping and for using weed. Legally, weed's status varies, but the user says it's illegal where they live. So if the user reports the customer for using weed, that's a legal matter. But is the user justified? The customer isn't just not tipping; they're actively choosing to leave zero tips, which affects the user's income. However, the user's main job is delivering pizza. Should they report someone for a personal issue (tips) by involving the police over something else (weed use)?\n\nAlso, the user's motivation here is financial. They rely on tips and lose money on these deliveries. But using the police to address a customer's weed use might be seen as a misuse of resources. Even if it's illegal, the user isn't in a position to enforce the law. It's up to law enforcement to handle such cases, not someone seeking better tips. The user could be seen as exploiting the situation for personal gain. \n\nOn the other hand, if the customer is indeed using an illegal substance, even if the user's main job isn't to police that, they might feel they're doing the right thing for legal compliance. But the customer's weed use isn't causing harm beyond the user's tipping issue. So the user's action could be considered crossing a line from a personal grievance to a legal report, which might be the wrong approach. \n\nSo the author might be in the wrong because their primary motivation is financial, and using a legal report as a means to address that could be seen as unethical. Even if the weed use is illegal, the user's intent is to get better tips, not to genuinely address a legal violation. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
