Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a delivery driver who is working for a pizza place. The customer has not tipped multiple times, and the driver notices that the customer is stoned and smells of weed. The driver is considering reporting the customer to the police because weed is illegal where they live. The driver mentions that they lose money on each delivery to this customer and that the customer intentionally leaves a $0 tip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality of the situation. If marijuana is illegal in their area, then the customer is technically breaking the law by using it. However, the driver is not a law enforcement officer. Reporting someone for smoking weed might be within their rights, but it's a judgment call. The driver's main job is to deliver pizza, not to enforce laws. \n\nThen there's the issue of the tips. The customer has not tipped four times, which affects the driver's income. The driver is making $5 an hour and relies on tips. But the customer isn't obligated to tip, even if they're high. The driver might feel exploited, but the customer's choice not to tip is separate from their personal habits. \n\nThe driver's motivation here is a bit questionable. They might be using the weed use as a reason to report the customer, but the main issue is the lack of tips. The driver could be using the customer's drug use as a pretext for their actions. It's important to consider if the driver is overstepping their role by reporting a private matter. \n\nAlso, considering the potential consequences for the customer, who might face legal trouble. The driver isn't directly harmed by the customer's weed use, just the lack of tips. So the driver is taking a moral stance that might not be justified given the circumstances. \n\nIn many cases, people might argue that it's not the delivery person's place to report customers unless there's a direct threat or harm. The driver is in a service role, and enforcing laws isn't their responsibility. The customer's actions, while possibly illegal, don't directly affect the driver beyond the tips. \n\nSo, I think the author is in the wrong because they're using a personal issue (lack of tips) as a reason to report someone for an activity that, while illegal, doesn't directly harm the driver beyond their job. The driver's action could be seen as a misuse of their position and potentially malicious.\n"
