Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a delivery driver who's considering reporting a customer for smoking weed. The customer hasn't tipped four times, and each time, he's stoned and writes $0.00 as a tip. The driver makes $5 an hour and relies on tips. The question is whether the driver is in the wrong for wanting to report the customer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. If weed is illegal where they live, then using it is against the law. The customer is using it in their own home, which sometimes is a gray area depending on local laws. But if it's illegal, then the driver might be right to report it. But wait, the driver's job is to deliver pizza, not to enforce the law. Should they be the one to report someone for personal drug use? That could be seen as overstepping.\n\nThen there's the tipping issue. The customer is not tipping, which affects the driver's income. The driver might feel justified because they lose money on that delivery due to distance. But is reporting the customer for not tipping appropriate? The driver could confront them politely, maybe ask for a tip next time, but reporting to police for not tipping is a big step. Tipping is optional, even though it's expected in some industries. Legally, not tipping isn't a crime unless there's some specific law requiring it, which is rare. So reporting for non-tipping might not be valid.\n\nThe driver's motivation here is twofold: loss of income and witnessing illegal activity. If the driver is reporting out of anger over not getting tips, that could be a problem. They might be using the drug use as an excuse to get back at the customer for not tipping. That's a possible misuse of authority. However, if they genuinely believe the drug use is illegal and they're reporting that as a separate issue, maybe it's a different scenario. But even then, bystanders can report crimes, but sometimes there's a line between being vigilant and being a snitch.\n\nAlso, the customer is writing $0.00, which is different from forgetting. So the customer is intentionally not tipping. The driver might feel disrespected, but is that grounds for legal action? Probably not. The driver's main issue is financial, but using the police to address it might be inappropriate.\n\nSo, putting it all together: reporting the customer for drug use (illegal) is one thing, but if the main motive is revenge for no tips, that's a problem. The driver might be in the wrong for using the report as a way to address their own financial grievances, which are unrelated to the potential illegal activity. Even if the drug use is illegal, the driver's primary role isn't law enforcement, so stepping into that role could be seen as overreaching. Therefore, the answer is A (author is in the wrong).\n"
