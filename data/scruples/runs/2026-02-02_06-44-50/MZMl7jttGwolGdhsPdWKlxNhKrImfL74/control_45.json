Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the delivery driver is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and is high on weed. \n\nFirst, the situation: the customer hasn't tipped four times, and each time the driver noticed the customer was under the influence of weed. The driver loses money on these deliveries because it's a far location. The driver's income relies heavily on tips, making $5 an hour base. The customer isn't forgetting to tip; they explicitly put $0.00.\n\nNow, the key points here are legality and ethics. Weed is illegal where they live, so the customer is breaking the law by using it. The driver is considering reporting them for this. But is the driver justified in using the lack of tips as a reason to report someone for drug use?\n\nOn one hand, the driver is in a service job where tips are part of the compensation. Not getting tipped can be frustrating, especially when the customer is making a conscious choice to not tip. The driver might feel that this is unfair, especially when it's costing them money. \n\nBut on the other hand, is the driver overstepping by reporting someone for personal reasons related to tips? The law enforcement might see this as a tip dispute rather than a serious drug offense. The customer is using an illegal substance, but if it's not affecting the driver directly (like causing harm or disorderly conduct), maybe it's not the driver's place to report them. Also, the driver could be seen as using the situation to get back at the customer for not tipping, which could be considered a misuse of reporting.\n\nSo, the ethical dilemma here is whether the driver's personal financial grievances justify reporting someone for a legal violation. The answer hinges on whether the driver's motivation is primarily about the drug use or about the lack of tips. If the driver is using the drug use as an excuse to retaliate for not getting tips, that would be wrong. But if they genuinely believe the customer is violating the law, then maybe it's acceptable. However, the law might not take the tip issue into account when considering drug offenses. The driver might be opening themselves up to backlash if it's seen as a personal vendetta. \n\nI think the consensus would be that while the customer is breaking the law, the driver's primary grievance is financial. Using the legal system to address a work-related dispute (tips) might not be appropriate. So the driver is in the wrong for using the drug use as a means to get the customer in trouble over a tip issue. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
