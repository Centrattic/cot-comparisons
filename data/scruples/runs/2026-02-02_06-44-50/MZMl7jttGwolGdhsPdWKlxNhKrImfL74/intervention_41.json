Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and smells like weed. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The person is a delivery driver who makes $5 an hour and relies on tips. The customer hasn't tipped four times, and each time the customer was clearly under the influence of marijuana, which is illegal in their area. The driver is considering reporting the customer to the police for smoking weed. The question is whether the driver is in the wrong for even thinking about doing that.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the legality of the customer's actions (using an illegal substance), the issue of not tipping, and the driver's personal financial situation. The driver argues that the customer intentionally doesn't tip (since it's written as $0.00), which affects their income, especially since it's a far delivery that costs them money. \n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants the community's opinion. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nNow, considering the law: if marijuana is illegal where they live, then the customer is indeed committing a crime by using it. However, the driver is in the position of reporting a customer for something that might be a private activity. Unless the driver has evidence that the customer is using marijuana in a public place or in a way that's observable and illegal, it's possible that the police might not act on such a report. The smell of weed could be a clue, but it's not proof. Also, the customer might be using it legally in their own home, depending on local laws (some places have medical or recreational legality, even if the poster says it's illegal there). Wait, the scenario says it's illegal where they live, so that's a factor.\n\nThen there's the business aspect. The customer isn't tipping, which is affecting the driver's income. But is it ethical to report someone for not tipping? The driver's job is to deliver the pizza, and the tip is optional. However, the customer is clearly choosing not to tip, which is frustrating for the driver. But using that as a reason to report them for a separate issue (marijuana use) could be seen as crossing a line. The driver might be using the tip issue as a pretext to report the customer for something else, which could be considered unethical or even retaliatory.\n\nAnother angle: the driver is in a position of power, and the customer is a paying customer. Reporting someone to the police can have serious consequences, so the driver should be cautious. Unless there's a legitimate safety concern (like the customer is impaired and dangerous), the driver's main issue is the lack of tips. \n\nHowever, if the driver has a genuine concern that the customer is using an illegal substance, maybe in a way that's dangerous (e.g., if the customer is impaired and might act recklessly), then reporting could be justified. But the scenario doesn't mention any dangerous behavior beyond the smell of weed and the customer being \"stoned.\" \n\nSo, the question is whether the driver is in the wrong by choosing to report the customer. If the driver is motivated primarily by the lack of tips rather than a genuine concern for illegal activity, then it's likely the driver is in the wrong. But if the driver is reporting out of a legitimate belief that the customer is committing a crime, even if the evidence is circumstantial, it's a gray area. However, the police might not take such a report seriously unless there's clear evidence.\n\nAlso, the driver's financial difficulties (making $5/hour and losing money on the delivery) add to the emotional aspect, but that doesn't necessarily justify illegal or unethical actions.\n\nIn summary, the key points are: the legality of the customer's actions, the driver's intent in reporting, and the ethical implications of using a personal grievance (lack of tips) to report someone for something else. The driver might be in the wrong because they're using the tip issue as a motive to report the customer for a private activity that might not be a police concern unless there's more evidence. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
