Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is a delivery driver who hasn't received tips from a customer multiple times. The customer smells like weed each time and intentionally leaves $0.00 in tips. The driver is losing money on these deliveries and is considering reporting the customer for smoking weed, which is illegal in their area.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is whether the driver is justified in reporting the customer for a non-tip-related reason. The driver's main grievance is the lack of tips, which affects their income. However, they want to report the customer for smoking weed, which is a separate legal issue. \n\nNow, even if the customer is smoking weed, which is illegal, the driver's motivation here seems to be retaliation for not tipping. Using a legal issue as leverage for a personal grievance might not be appropriate. The driver could instead focus on addressing the tip issue directly with the customer or the employer. Reporting someone to the police for a legal violation is a serious action and should be based on genuine legal concerns, not as a way to get back for not getting a tip. \n\nSo, the driver's intent might be seen as misuse of the legal system for personal gain. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
