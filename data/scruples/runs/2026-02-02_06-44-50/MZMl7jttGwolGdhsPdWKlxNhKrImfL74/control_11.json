Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is a delivery driver who hasn't received tips from a customer multiple times. The customer smells like weed each time and explicitly sets the tip to $0.00. The driver is considering reporting the customer for smoking weed, even though they themselves aren't against it personally. The key points here are legality, ethics, and the driver's financial reliance on tips.\n\nFirst, the legality of weed where they live is a factor. If it's illegal, then the customer is breaking the law by using it. However, just because someone is breaking the law doesn't necessarily mean others can report them for any reason. The driver's main grievance is the lack of tips, not the weed use per se. They mention they lose money on this delivery. So the driver is considering using the weed as a reason to report the customer, possibly to retaliate for not tipping.\n\nEthically, is it right to report someone to the police for not tipping? The driver is in a service job, and tips are part of their income. However, using the law against the customer over a service issue might be crossing a line. The customer is not committing a crime by not tipping; that's a business practice, not a legal offense. The weed use is illegal, but the driver is conflating the two issues. The customer's choice to use weed doesn't directly relate to the tip amount. So the driver might be using the weed as a pretext for their real frustration about the tips.\n\nAlso, the driver mentions they don't have a problem with weed personally, so the motivation here isn't about morality but about money. The question is whether reporting the customer for an unrelated illegal activity is justified. The police likely wouldn't take such a report seriously unless there's a direct, relevant violation. The driver could be seen as using the law in a vengeful way, which is unethical.\n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because they're using an unrelated illegal activity as a means to retaliate for not receiving tips, which is not a valid reason to report someone to the police. The correct choice is A.\n"
