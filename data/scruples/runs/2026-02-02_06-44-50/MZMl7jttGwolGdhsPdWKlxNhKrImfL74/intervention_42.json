Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the delivery driver is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who didn't tip multiple times and who he observed was smoking weed. The driver mentions that the customer writes $0.00 in the tip section, not just forgetting. The customer is one of the farthest deliveries, so the driver loses money each time. The driver relies on tips for income and doesn't have a problem with weed personally but thinks it's illegal where they live.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. If weed is indeed illegal in their location, then the customer could be breaking the law by using it. But the driver's job is to deliver pizza, not to enforce laws. However, the driver is in a position where they can observe the customer's behavior. But is it the driver's responsibility to report that? Maybe not, unless they have a reason to believe it's a drug-related crime beyond just smoking. Also, the driver is using the customer's lack of tips as a justification, which complicates things.\n\nNext, the ethics of using another person's personal behavior as a reason to report them, especially when the main grievance is about not tipping. If the customer is not tipping, that's a separate issue. The driver could address that by maybe not delivering to them anymore or asking for the tip, but using the weed as a reason to report them could be seen as using a personal issue as a pretext. \n\nAlso, the driver is making $5 an hour and relies on tips. That's a real financial concern. However, reporting someone to the police for not tipping and using an illegal substance might not be the right approach. The police might not consider this a criminal activity unless there's more involved, like drug dealing or public consumption in a place where it's prohibited. If the customer is just smoking at home, even if it's illegal, that might be a civil issue, not a police matter. \n\nThe driver's motivation here is mixed. They have a legitimate complaint about not being tipped, but they're using the weed as an excuse. That could be seen as a way to justify their action, but it's not necessarily the right approach. The appropriate action for not being tipped is to perhaps avoid the customer or ask for the tip, not to involve law enforcement over something that might not be a criminal act. \n\nSo, is the driver in the wrong? If the driver is using the weed as a reason to report the customer primarily because of the lack of tips, then yes, they might be in the wrong. They're taking a personal grievance and escalating it to the police, which might not be justified. Unless the customer is engaging in more serious criminal activity, just smoking weed and not tipping doesn't warrant a police report. The driver should address the tipping issue directly and maybe avoid the customer, but using the weed as a reason to report them could be seen as an overreach.\n"
