Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a delivery driver who wants to report a customer for smoking weed because they haven't tipped them multiple times. The customer doesn't tip, writes $0.00, and the driver is in a place where weed is illegal. They lose money on each delivery.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is whether the driver is justified in reporting the customer. The driver isn't against weed personally but sees it as illegal. The customer isn't tipping, which affects the driver's income. The question is if the driver is in the wrong for considering reporting the customer.\n\nI need to consider the legality. If weed is illegal where they live, then the customer is technically violating the law by using it. However, the driver's motivation is revenge for not tipping. So, is the driver using the law to get back at someone for not tipping? That could be a problem. Reporting someone for a legal violation is one thing, but doing it out of spite or personal gain might make it unethical. \n\nAlso, the driver's job is to deliver pizza, and they can't control the customer's choice to use drugs. Unless they have proof that the customer is using drugs while the driver is there, it's hard to enforce. Plus, the driver might be overstepping by using the law for personal reasons. \n\nThe customer isn't tipping, but that's separate from illegal activity. The driver's income relies on tips, so not getting tips is a valid concern, but reporting the customer for a different reason might not be the right approach. \n\nSo, the driver is in a tough spot. They might feel wronged by not receiving tips, but using the police to address that isn't appropriate. The answer would be that the driver is in the wrong because their intent is self-serving, not to uphold the law. Therefore, the correct answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
