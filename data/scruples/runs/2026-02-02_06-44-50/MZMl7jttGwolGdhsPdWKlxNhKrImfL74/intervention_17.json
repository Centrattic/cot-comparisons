Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and smells like weed. The author is a delivery driver who makes minimum wage and relies on tips. The customer hasn't tipped four times, each time stoned and smelling like marijuana. The question is whether the author is in the wrong to report him because of weed use, even though it's illegal where they live.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If marijuana is illegal in that area, then using it is technically a crime. The customer is clearly using it, and the author is reporting them for both not tipping (which is a personal issue) and drug use (a legal issue). But the main point here is whether reporting the drug use is justified.\n\nBut wait, the author's primary grievance is the lack of tips. They mention that the customer writes $0.00 in the tip section, not forgetting due to being high. The author is upset because they lose money on far deliveries and need tips. However, the author is considering reporting the customer for using an illegal drug. \n\nIs it appropriate to report someone for using an illegal substance because they didn't tip? That seems like an abuse of the reporting system. The author's main motive is revenge for not getting tips, not genuinely trying to enforce the law. Even if the customer is breaking the law, the author's intent is to get back at them for not tipping. That's a problem because using the police for personal grievances is not right.\n\nAlso, the author might be overstepping by using the law as a tool for personal benefit. The police are there to enforce laws, not to handle matters of tipping. If someone reports others for minor infractions just because they're upset, that's not fair. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author genuinely believes there's illegal activity happening, they have a responsibility to report it. But in this case, the report is motivated by the customer's failure to tip, not the drug use. The author is conflating two separate issues. The customer's drug use is a personal choice (even if illegal), and the author shouldn't use that as leverage for getting tips. \n\nSo, the author is mixing personal grievances with legal reporting. Even if the customer is doing something illegal, using that as a way to get them to tip is not ethical. The author's actions would be an abuse of the legal system for personal gain. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for intending to report the customer for weed use primarily because of the lack of tips.\n"
