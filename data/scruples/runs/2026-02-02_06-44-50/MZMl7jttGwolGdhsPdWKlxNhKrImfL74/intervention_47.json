Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're an asshole for reporting a customer to the police because the customer hasn't tipped them four times and the person smells like weed. The author says they don't have a problem with people smoking weed, but it's illegal where they live. They mention that the customer is one of their farthest deliveries, so they lose money each time. The customer writes $0.00 in the tip section, not forgetting because they're high. The author makes $5 an hour and relies on tips.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The question is whether reporting someone for not tipping and possibly smoking weed is justified.\n\nLegally, if the customer is using marijuana, which is illegal in their area, then the author reporting them for that would be a legal action. But the main issue here is the tipping. The customer not tipping is a matter of service and payment, which is different from illegal activity. The author is frustrated because the customer isn't contributing to their income through tips, especially since they lose money on each delivery.\n\nBut wait, the author's main motivation might be the lack of tips, not the actual illegal activity. Even though the customer is smoking weed, the author's reason for reporting could be more about the money than the law. That raises a question about intent. If the author is using the weed as an excuse to report someone for not tipping, that could be considered unethical. However, if the author genuinely believes the customer is breaking the law, they have a duty to report illegal activity. \n\nBut the problem is that the author doesn't have concrete evidence that the customer is using weed illegally. They just smell it and see them acting stoned. The customer might have a medical exemption or it could be legal in another jurisdiction, even if it's not where the author lives. The author might be making an assumption here. Also, the act of not tipping isn't illegal, so the author can't report them for that. The author could report the suspected illegal activity, but if it's based on just smelling weed, that might not hold up in court. \n\nAdditionally, the author's main grievance is the lack of tips, so using the weed as a pretext to report the customer could be seen as a way to get money from them indirectly. That would be unethical because the author is using a legal issue as a way to enforce a personal grievance about tips. \n\nSo, the author's actions might be motivated by the tips rather than the actual illegal activity. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for using the weed as a reason to report someone based on a personal financial issue, especially without clear evidence of illegal activity. The correct answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
