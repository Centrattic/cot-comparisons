Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who hasn't tipped multiple times and seems high on weed.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is a delivery driver who makes $5 an hour and relies on tips. The customer has refused to tip four times, each time explicitly setting the tip to $0.00. The author notices the customer smells like weed and is stoned. They also mention that delivering to this customer is costly because it's a far location, making them lose money each time. The author is wondering if reporting the customer is justified.\n\nNow, the key points here are the legal and ethical aspects. The author is in a place where weed is illegal. The customer's use of weed could be a legal violation. However, the author's primary grievance is about not receiving tips, which is their main source of income. The question is whether using the weed use as a reason to report the customer makes the author an asshole.\n\nLegally, if the customer is using an illegal substance, the author might have a valid reason to report them. But ethically, is it right to report someone for not tipping? The author is in a position where their income is dependent on tips, so not getting tips directly affects their earnings. However, the act of reporting someone for a legal offense (if it's true) might be justified, but the main motivation here is financial gain from the police action, which could be seen as exploiting the situation.\n\nAlso, the customer's refusal to tip is a separate issue. The author could address this by not delivering to them or communicating the issue, but using the weed use as an excuse to report might be crossing a line. The author's intention might be more about getting the tips indirectly by reporting the customer for another offense. That could be seen as using the law to their advantage, which is ethically questionable.\n\nOn the other hand, if the customer is indeed violating the law by using an illegal drug, the author might have a duty to report it, regardless of the tip issue. However, the author's motivation here is mixed. They are using the weed use as a reason, but the real problem is the lack of tips. This could make the author seem like they're taking advantage of the situation for personal gain, which is where the ethical dilemma lies.\n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the author's action is primarily about legal compliance or about seeking compensation for lost tips. If the author is using the illegal activity as a pretext to address their own financial issue, that's where they might be in the wrong. Reporting someone should be based on actual legal violations, not as a means to get money. However, if the customer is indeed using an illegal substance, then it's a legal issue regardless. But the author's motivation here is questionable.\n\nIn many places, it's illegal to use cannabis, so the act itself is a crime. However, the author's knowledge of the customer's drug use is based on smelling weed and seeing their condition. The author might not have definitive proof, which could lead to false reporting. If the report is based on suspicion without evidence, that's problematic.\n\nAdditionally, the author's reliance on tips is understandable, but using legal means to force the customer to tip by reporting them could be considered unethical. The author should perhaps address the tip issue directly, like not delivering to that customer anymore or asking for the tip when delivering. Using the law as a tool to get what they want might be the wrong approach.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is not in the wrong if the customer is indeed violating the law, but the author's motivation is questionable. However, if the author is using the weed use as an excuse to bypass the customer's right to not tip, then they are in the wrong. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering the report, the answer would be B (No), because the customer's actions are illegal, and the author has a right to report it, even if their primary motivation is financial. However, the ethical aspect is murky. But legally, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting a potential crime. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
