Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and is often high on weed. The customer has not tipped four times, and each time, the driver noticed the customer smelled like weed. The driver is losing money on these far deliveries and relies on tips since they only make $5/hour.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality of marijuana where they live. The user mentions it's illegal there, so if the customer is using it, that's a potential offense. However, the user's job is to deliver pizza, not to enforce laws. Reporting someone for a drug violation is a big step. The user's main issue is the lack of tips, which is a separate matter.\n\nIs the user justified in reporting for not tipping? Tips in the U.S. are usually voluntary, though some places might expect them. But the user can't force someone to tip. Reporting someone to the police for not tipping is probably not justified. The user is upset about losing money on deliveries, but that's a business or employment issue, not a criminal one.\n\nThe user might feel wronged financially, but using the police to address that is inappropriate. The correct action would be to address the tipping issue with their employer or find another way to handle it. Reporting for drug use is a different matter, but the user's motivation seems to be about the tips. Even if the customer is using an illegal drug, the driver isn't in a position to enforce that unless they have a valid reason to suspect criminal activity beyond just the smell.\n\nSo the user is not in the right to report the customer. The right answer is A because the user is using a potential drug offense as a way to retaliate for not receiving tips, which is not a valid reason for a report. The driver's motivations are based on financial loss from the tips, not genuine concern for illegal activity. Therefore, the user is in the wrong.\n"
