Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a pizza delivery driver who hasn't received tips from a customer multiple times. The customer smells like weed and is stoned during deliveries, and the author is considering reporting them to the police because weed is illegal where they live. The author wants to know if they would be an asshole for doing so.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The customer didn't tip four times, and each time they were high on weed. The author is a delivery driver making $5 an hour and relying on tips. The customer intentionally sets the tip to $0.00, so it's not a mistake. Also, the delivery is far, so the author loses money each time. The author is considering reporting the customer for smoking weed, which is illegal in their area.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to report the customer. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the customer not tipping is a separate issue. However, the author is using that as a reason to report someone for a different illegal activity\u2014smoking weed. Even if the customer didn't tip, does that justify reporting them for something else? The author might be conflating two issues: the customer's choice not to tip and their use of an illegal substance.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is a delivery driver who depends on tips for income. The customer's deliberate decision not to tip might be seen as unfair, especially if the service was good. But the author's main justification for reporting is the weed use. Even if the author is upset about the lack of tips, using that as a motive to report someone for a crime they observed (assuming they can confirm it) is a separate matter.\n\nBut here's the catch: if the author is reporting the customer solely because of the weed use (which is illegal), then they are doing so for a legitimate reason. However, if they are using the weed use as a pretext to retaliate for not being tipped, that could be problematic. The author's main stated reason is the illegality of weed, but there's an underlying motive of financial loss from tips and delivery costs.\n\nAnother angle: Is the author allowed to report someone for smoking weed? If the author is in a place where weed is illegal, then yes, they can report it. However, they need to have valid evidence. If they can confirm the customer is smoking weed and it's illegal, then reporting them isn't illegal. But the author might be overstepping by using a personal grievance (lack of tips) to justify reporting someone for a crime. But if the author genuinely believes the customer is committing a crime, then they might be justified in reporting it, regardless of their personal feelings about the tips.\n\nBut wait, the author mentions that the customer smells like weed and appears stoned. Is that enough evidence to report? The actual act of smoking weed is what's illegal. If the customer is smoking in their home, the author might not have direct evidence of the act itself, just the odor. So maybe the author doesn't have enough proof to make a valid report. This could lead to a false accusation, which would be problematic.\n\nAlso, the author's primary grievance is the lack of tips. They might be using the weed issue as a way to retaliate against the customer who isn't tipping. That would be in the wrong because they're using a personal conflict to justify a legal action that might be unfounded. However, if the author genuinely believes the customer is violating the law, they might think they're justified in reporting, even if their feelings about the tips are a contributing factor.\n\nIn terms of morality, is it right to report someone for something else because you're upset about a different issue? That could be seen as vengeful or exploiting a legal system for personal gain. Even if the action is legal, the moral aspect comes into play. The author might be in the wrong if their primary motivation is retaliation, not the actual illegal activity.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer might hinge on whether the author is reporting the customer for a legitimate reason (illegal activity) or using that as an excuse to get back at them (for not tipping). If the author is genuinely concerned about the law being broken, then they might not be in the wrong. However, if they're using it as a pretext for revenge, then they are in the wrong.\n\nIn the scenario, the author states that they \"have no problem with smoking weed personally\" but that \"their body their choice,\" but since it's illegal, they feel it's right to report. The author also mentions that the customer is stoned and smells like weed, which could be evidence. However, without direct observation of the act, it's possible the author doesn't have enough. Also, the author's main problem is the lack of tips, which could indicate that their primary motive is financial, not legal. Therefore, using the weed issue to report the customer might be a way to retaliate, making the author in the wrong.\n"
