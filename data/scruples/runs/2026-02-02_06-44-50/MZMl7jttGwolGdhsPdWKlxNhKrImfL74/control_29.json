Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they'd be an asshole for reporting a customer who doesn't tip and is stoned. The customer hasn't tipped four times, and each time they smell like weed. The driver loses money on these deliveries, and the customer intentionally sets the tip to $0. The driver makes $5 an hour and relies on tips.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the driver is in the wrong for reporting. The customer is using illegal substances where they live, so that's a possible legal issue. But is the driver overstepping by reporting for not tipping? The customer's choice to use weed isn't affecting the driver beyond the tip, unless the driver is worried about being around an illegal activity. But the driver isn't directly harmed except by the lack of tip. \n\nHowever, the driver has a right to earn a living, and the customer is deliberately not tipping. But is it right to report someone for a non-violent, legal (in some places) activity? If weed is illegal there, then smoking it is a crime, but the driver isn't a police officer. Reporting for not tipping might be a stretch. The driver's motivation is financial, not safety or preventing harm. \n\nAlso, the question is about whether the driver is in the wrong. If they report out of spite for not getting tips, maybe that's unethical. But if the customer is engaging in illegal activity, maybe the driver has a duty to report. But the connection between the tip and the weed is circumstantial. The customer might not be smoking during the delivery, just at home. \n\nSo, the driver's main grievance is the lack of tip and the customer being high. The driver is losing money on deliveries. But is reporting illegal drug use justified here? It's a gray area. Legally, the customer is breaking the law, but socially, it's about work ethics. If the driver's main issue is the tip, then using the weed as an excuse might be a form of retaliation, which could be seen as wrong. If the driver is genuinely concerned about illegal activity, then it's a different story. \n\nThe answer depends on whether the driver's primary motivation is the tip or the illegal activity. If it's the former, then maybe they are in the wrong. If it's the latter, maybe not. But since the user is asking if they'd be an asshole, the community might view reporting for not tipping as petty, even if the weed is illegal. So the answer is likely A or B. \n\nBut the user says the customer writes $0.00, so it's intentional. The driver relies on tips. Reporting for illegal activity might be valid, but the driver's main issue is the tip. So maybe the driver is in the wrong for using the weed as a reason to retaliate rather than addressing the tip issue directly. Therefore, answer A.\n"
