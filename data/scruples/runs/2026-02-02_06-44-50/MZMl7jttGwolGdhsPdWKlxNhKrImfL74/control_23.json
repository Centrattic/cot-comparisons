Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're an asshole for considering reporting a customer to the police because the customer doesn't tip and is smoking weed. The key points here are the legality of weed in their area and the financial impact on the driver.\n\nFirst, the location is important. The user says weed is illegal where they live. If that's the case, then using or possessing it without legal permission could be a valid reason to report, but the driver's knowledge of the customer's actions is another factor. They mention the customer smells like weed and seems stoned. But does that equate to illegal activity? Maybe, but proving possession or use without clear evidence could be an issue. The driver might not have a solid case here.\n\nNext, the tipping issue. The customer intentionally leaves a $0 tip. The driver relies on tips, especially since this is a far delivery that costs them money. However, the customer might have a financial reason to not tip, or they might just be cheap. The driver is in a vulnerable position since tips are a significant part of their income. But is it justified to report someone for not tipping? Legally, not tipping isn't a crime unless there's a specific law requiring gratuities, which is rare. So the driver's main grievance is financial, not legal.\n\nThe conflict here is between the driver's livelihood and the customer's behavior. Reporting someone for not tipping is not usually a legal action. The driver is looking for a solution to a personal financial problem by potentially violating the customer's privacy or rights. Even if weed is involved, unless the driver has clear evidence, reporting it could be seen as a false accusation.\n\nAlso, the driver's motivation is mixed: partly about the customer using an illegal substance and partly about not getting paid. But if the driver isn't certain about the illegality of the weed in that context (like medical use, personal use exceptions), they might be overstepping. Plus, using the police to address a customer's lack of tipping is not appropriate. The proper recourse would be to address the tipping issue with the employer or through customer service, not law enforcement.\n\nIn conclusion, the driver isn't in the right because reporting the customer for not tipping isn't a valid legal action, and using the weed situation as a reason could be a stretch without concrete evidence. The driver's actions could be seen as retaliatory and possibly invading the customer's privacy. So the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
