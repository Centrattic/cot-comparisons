Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is a pizza delivery driver who hasn't been tipped by a particular customer multiple times. Each time, the customer is clearly under the influence of marijuana, which is illegal in their area. The customer always marks a $0 tip, and the author loses money on these deliveries since it's a long distance. The author is considering reporting the customer to the police for smoking weed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality of marijuana. If it's illegal where they live, then the customer is technically breaking the law by using it. However, the author's main motivation seems to be the lack of tips and financial loss, not necessarily the customer's drug use. The author mentions they don't have a problem with weed in general, just the customer's choice not to tip. \n\nBut wait, the author is thinking of reporting the customer for smoking weed, which is a legal issue. However, the primary reason for reporting might be the customer's failure to tip, which isn't a legal matter. This could indicate that the author is using the drug use as an excuse to get back at the customer for not tipping. That could be a problem because reporting someone for a legal infraction when your main grievance is unrelated might be seen as a misuse of the reporting system. \n\nAlso, the author relies on tips for income, and the customer's zero tips are affecting their earnings. But the author's decision to report someone for a legal infraction because of a business transaction gone wrong might cross a line. Law enforcement typically handles criminal activity, and using that system for personal financial grievances isn't appropriate. \n\nSo, even if the customer is breaking the law by using marijuana, the author's primary grievance is the lack of tips. Reporting someone for a legal infraction to retaliate for non-payment might be unethical or even considered harassment. The author could be misusing the reporting process as a form of punishment instead of addressing the issue through appropriate channels, like discussing with their employer about compensation for long deliveries or addressing the customer's tipping habits directly if possible. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they're using a legal report as a means of retaliation for non-legal reasons. Even if the customer is violating the law, the author's intent is more about the tips than the drug use, making their action inappropriate.\n"
