Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer to the police because the customer doesn't tip and is smoking weed.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author works as a delivery driver, and the customer hasn't tipped multiple times. They notice the customer is stoned and smells like weed. The author is considering reporting them because they lose money on the deliveries and need tips to make a living. They mention that the customer writes $0.00 in the tip section, not forgetting. The location is where weed is illegal.\n\nSo, the main points are: reporting a customer for not tipping and using marijuana. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering this.\n\nFirst, legal aspect: if marijuana is illegal in the area, the customer is technically breaking the law. The author might think they have a duty to report illegal activity. But maybe the author isn't in a position to enforce the law. As a delivery driver, their role is to deliver pizza, not to police customers. So even if the customer is using an illegal substance, the author isn't a law enforcement officer and might not be the one to report them.\n\nThen, the tipping issue. The customer isn't tipping, which affects the author's income. The author is in a service job, relying on tips. The user might think that not tipping is rude or unethical. However, the customer's choice not to tip is their decision, and the author can't force them to tip. But since the author is losing money each time, they might feel justified in seeking compensation somehow.\n\nBut the connection between the two issues is key here. The author is considering reporting the customer for smoking weed, not for not tipping. So the author is trying to link the two: the customer's illegal activity as a reason to report them for the purpose of getting the tip or maybe getting some kind of action taken. But is that appropriate?\n\nThe user asked whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nIn many cases, people are advised not to use illegal activities as leverage for other grievances. For example, if someone doesn't pay you, you can't report them for something else they did. So the author might be using the weed use as a way to retaliate for not tipping. That's a misuse of the reporting system. The police are there to enforce the law, not to handle business transactions. So reporting the customer for smoking weed just because they didn't tip could be considered unethical or even illegal, as it's a form of entrapment or misuse of authority.\n\nAlso, the author is in a position where they have a direct business relationship with the customer. The customer's choice not to tip is a separate issue from their personal drug use. The author shouldn't exploit one to address the other. Therefore, the author would be in the wrong for reporting the customer solely for that reason.\n\nSo the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
