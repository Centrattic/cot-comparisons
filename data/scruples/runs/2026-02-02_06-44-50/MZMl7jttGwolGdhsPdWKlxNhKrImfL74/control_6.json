Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the delivery driver is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and smells like weed.\n\nFirst, the driver mentions that the customer hasn't tipped four times. The customer smells of weed each time, which is illegal where they live. The driver loses money on each delivery because it's a far location. They make $5 an hour and rely on tips.\n\nSo, the main points are: the customer is using an illegal substance, not tipping, and the driver is considering reporting them for that. The driver isn't okay with the lack of tips and thinks the customer is choosing to give $0, not forgetting. \n\nNow, the question is whether the driver is wrong. Legally, if the customer is using an illegal drug, the driver might have a case. However, is it the driver's place to report someone just for not tipping? That's a bit of a conflict of interest. The driver's job is to deliver, not enforce laws. \n\nAlso, maybe the customer is using weed legally in some way, but the driver's location has different laws. But the driver says it's illegal where they live. So if the customer is in violation, then reporting is legal. However, the driver's motivation is about not getting tipped. That could be a problem because it's using the law for personal gain. \n\nThere's also the aspect of privacy. Can the driver just report someone based on the smell of weed and a lack of tips? Maybe the police would need more evidence. Plus, the driver might be overstepping by using a legal issue as a reason for a personal grievance about tips. \n\nSo, the driver's intentions might be questionable. They\u2019re using a legal justification to address a personal financial issue. That could make them wrong because they're exploiting a legal situation for their benefit. \n\nOn the other hand, if the customer is indeed using an illegal substance, the driver isn't wrong for reporting that. But if the driver's main issue is the tips, then it's a different story. Mixing the two issues might make the driver the wrongdoer here. \n\nIn some places, even if someone is using weed illegally, the police might not act unless there's more evidence than just smell. So the driver might be wrong in their approach. Also, the driver's job is to deliver, not to police customers. Using their job to enforce personal judgments could be seen as wrong. \n\nSo considering all that, the answer would likely be A, that the author is in the wrong because they're using a legal issue as a pretext for their personal financial grievances.\n"
