Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who hasn't tipped them multiple times and who they suspect is smoking weed. \n\nFirst, the customer isn't tipping\u2014four times, and each time the driver notices the person smells like weed and is clearly stoned. The driver mentions it's illegal where they live, so that's a key point. The customer is also one of the farthest deliveries, meaning the driver is losing money on those trips. The driver's income is partly based on tips, making $5 an hour and relying on tips.\n\nThe question is whether the driver is in the wrong for wanting to report the customer. The user's initial thought is that the driver is in the wrong, but others might have a different view.\n\nSo, the main issues here are: 1) Should the driver report someone for a personal issue (not tipping) even if the customer is possibly violating the law (using illegal drugs)? 2) Is the driver's motivation (lack of tips) a valid reason to report someone?\n\nOn one hand, the driver's job is to deliver, and the customer's drug use is a separate matter. The driver isn't supposed to enforce the law themselves. Reporting someone for personal gain (to get a tip) could be seen as a misuse of authority. The driver isn't a law enforcement officer, so they might be overstepping by involving the police for a personal grievance.\n\nOn the other hand, if the customer is indeed using illegal drugs, the driver might have a responsibility to report that. But the driver's primary grievance is the lack of tips, not the drug use. The driver might be conflating the two issues\u2014using the drug use as a reason to report, but the real issue is the tips. That could make the report a pretext for something else, which might be wrong.\n\nAlso, the customer isn't just forgetting to tip; they're intentionally putting $0.00. So the driver could argue that the customer is not being fair, but that's a different issue. The driver should focus on the tips through appropriate channels, like talking to management or the customer directly, rather than involving the police over something that's not a criminal offense (not tipping, per se). Unless the drug use is causing a specific safety issue (like if the customer is impaired and dangerous), reporting for just being high might not be justified.\n\nSo, the driver's motive here seems to be about the financial loss from the lack of tips and the distance of the delivery. Using the presence of illegal drugs as a reason to report, when the main issue is the tips, could be seen as using a legal concern as a cover for a personal dispute. That would likely make the driver in the wrong. The correct action might be to address the tipping issue directly, not report for a legal offense that's not directly related to the service provided, unless there's a safety concern.\n"
