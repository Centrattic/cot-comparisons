Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The person is a delivery driver who hasn't received tips multiple times from a customer, and each time the customer was clearly under the influence of weed. They mention that it's illegal where they live, so the customer might be breaking the law by possessing or using marijuana. The driver is losing money on these deliveries because it's a far location and they rely on tips to supplement their $5 hourly wage.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is whether the driver is justifying reporting the customer for a non-tip-related reason. The driver's motivation is primarily financial: they want tips and are upset about consistently getting none. However, they noticed the customer is high and smells like weed, which is illegal. So, the driver is considering reporting the customer for an illegal activity, but the underlying reason is the lack of tips.\n\nThe question is if the driver is in the wrong for using the weed as an excuse to report the customer when their real issue is the tips. Legally, if the customer is indeed violating the law by using an illegal substance, the driver has a right to report it. But the problem is the driver's intent. It might be seen as a misuse of their position to target someone for a law violation because they're angry about not getting tips, rather than out of genuine concern for the law being broken.\n\nAlso, the customer is specifically noting that the tip was set to $0.00, so it's intentional, not just forgetfulness. The driver's wage is low, so tips are crucial. However, using the police to address a customer's tipping behavior crosses a line. It's possible the driver is conflating their personal grievance with the customer's actions into a legal report, which could be seen as retaliatory or vindictive.\n\nIn terms of ethics, even if the action is legal, it's questionable. The driver is in a position to serve the customer, and using that position to report them for a separate issue (tips) rather than just not serving them again might be considered wrong. The right approach might be to avoid delivering to the customer if it's not profitable, but using a law enforcement report for that purpose is ethically problematic.\n\nSo considering intent, proportionality, and the potential misuse of legal reporting for personal gain, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong). But I need to make sure I'm not missing any nuances. If the driver truly believes the customer is violating the law (if weed is illegal in their area), then reporting it is their right. However, the primary motive here seems to be about the tips, which makes the action questionable.\n"
