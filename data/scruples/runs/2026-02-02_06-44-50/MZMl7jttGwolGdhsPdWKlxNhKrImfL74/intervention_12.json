Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the delivery driver is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and smells like weed. The driver says the customer has given zero tips four times, each time the customer is stoned and smells of marijuana. The driver is wondering if they're an asshole for reporting them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The user mentions that marijuana is illegal where they live. If the customer is using it, then the driver reporting them might be a legal action. But there's a difference between witnessing illegal activity and being a private person reporting it. In many places, citizens can report crimes, but there's also a risk of overstepping, especially if there's no direct evidence beyond the smell and the customer's own admission (like writing zero tip). \n\nThen there's the ethical side. The driver is a delivery person, relying on tips for income. The customer not tipping is a separate issue. The driver might feel wronged, but reporting someone for drug use based on smell and observations could be seen as invasive. Also, the driver might be using the customer's drug use as a justification for not getting tipped, but maybe the customer just doesn't tip anyone regardless of the situation. \n\nThe driver's motivations here are important. Are they genuinely concerned about a crime, or are they upset about not getting tips? If the driver is primarily motivated by the lack of tips, then reporting might not be appropriate. The line between legal reporting and personal vendetta can be blurry here. \n\nAlso, the driver's statement about losing money on each delivery adds another layer. They might feel the situation is unfair, but that doesn't necessarily justify a report. It's possible the customer is just a non-tipper, not necessarily involved in illegal activity. \n\nSo, the key points are: legality of marijuana in the area, whether the driver has a valid suspicion of a crime, and the driver's motivations. If the driver is misusing their right to report as a form of retaliation for lack of tips, that's problematic. However, if they genuinely believe a crime is occurring, they might have a valid reason. \n\nBut since the driver is relying on their own observations (smell of weed, which is a common indicator but not proof), and the customer's own actions (writing $0.00), there might not be enough evidence. Plus, the driver's main grievance is the lack of tips, which is a different issue from drug use. \n\nTherefore, the driver's intent here might be more about seeking compensation for tips than reporting a crime. That makes them potentially in the wrong, as using the law to force a tip from a customer crosses ethical boundaries. So the answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
