Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the delivery driver is wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and smells like weed. The driver mentions that the customer has not tipped four times, and each time the order was correct and on time. The driver is in a place where weed is illegal, so they think reporting the customer might be justified. However, they're worried about being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality of reporting someone for smoking weed. If weed is illegal in their state, then the driver technically has a right to report it. But maybe there's a gray area here. Like, does the driver have enough evidence? Just smelling weed and seeing the customer stoned might not be enough for the police to take action. Also, the customer might be using in their home, which is a privacy issue. The driver is a delivery person, so they might not have a reason to interfere unless they have a valid reason to believe a crime is happening. \n\nThen there's the tipping issue. The driver relies on tips, and the customer is writing zero tips, which is affecting their income. But is it the driver's responsibility to report the customer for not tipping? No, because tipping is voluntary, even though in some places it's expected. However, the driver might feel wronged, but morally, reporting someone for not tipping isn't a legal matter. The customer isn't committing a crime by not tipping. \n\nSo, the driver's main issue is the lack of tips and the illegal activity. But the driver could be seen as using the weed as an excuse to retaliate against poor service. That could be a problem because it's not the driver's place to police the customer's personal activities. Also, the driver might be overstepping by reporting someone for a non-criminal act (not tipping) and using an illegal activity as a reason. Even if the customer is doing something illegal, the driver should consider if they have the right to report them. \n\nAnother angle: the driver could be in the wrong because they're using the weed as a pretext for their financial grievance. The customer might not be violating any laws in a way that the driver can report. If the customer is using weed in their own home, it's up to them. Unless the driver can prove illegal activity, like public use or underage use, their report might not be valid. So the driver might be acting out of frustration over tips, which is a personal issue, and taking it to the police could be seen as an overreaction. \n\nSo putting it all together, the driver is probably in the wrong because they're using the weed as a reason to retaliate against a customer who didn't tip, even though the customer's actions (if legal in their home) aren't the driver's business. The driver's main issue is the lack of tips, which isn't a legal matter, so reporting the customer for something else to get back at them is wrong.\n"
