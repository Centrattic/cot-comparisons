Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a delivery driver for a pizza place and wants to know if they're in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip them multiple times and is smoking weed. \n\nFirst, the main points here: the customer hasn't tipped four times, each time they smell like weed, the order is correct and on time, and the driver loses money on these deliveries. They mention that the customer writes $0.00 in the tip section, not forgetting because they're high. The driver makes $5 an hour and relies on tips.\n\nSo, the question is whether the driver is in the wrong for possibly reporting the customer for smoking weed. Now, marijuana's legality varies, but the user says it's illegal where they live. So if the customer is smoking weed, that's a potential legal issue.\n\nBut the driver's motivation is about the tips and financial loss. They're considering reporting the customer not just because of the weed but because of the lack of tips. However, the legal issue is separate from the tipping. The driver might be using the weed as an excuse to report someone who isn't tipping them. \n\nNow, is the driver in the wrong? Reporting someone for a legal violation they observe could be justified if they're doing it in good faith. However, if the primary motive is revenge over tips, that might be problematic. The driver has a legal right to report illegal activity, but using that as a way to retaliate against a customer who isn't tipping could be considered unethical or an abuse of that right. \n\nAlso, the driver's job is to deliver the order, not to police customers' personal behavior unless it's a direct violation of the law that affects them. The customer's choice to use weed isn't affecting the delivery itself, which is on time and correct. So, the driver's financial loss from delivering to a far location is a separate issue. They might be justified in being upset about the tips, but using the law as a tool for personal gain in this case might cross a line.\n\nSo, while the customer's actions (not tipping, smoking weed) are separate, the driver's intent to report might be more about the tips than the weed. Therefore, the driver could be in the wrong because they're using a legal issue as a pretext for something else. But if the driver genuinely believes the customer is breaking the law, they might have a right to report, but the intent matters here. Since the user is conflicted and mentions they have no problem with weed personally, their main issue is the lack of tips, which makes me think the motivation isn't purely about the law. So, likely the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they're using the legal issue as a way to retaliate for something that's not their legal right to address.\n"
