Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they'd be in the wrong for reporting a customer who doesn't tip and is smoking weed. The person hasn't tipped four times, and each time they were clearly stoned and smelled like weed. The driver is losing money on these deliveries because it's a far location. They make $5 an hour and rely on tips. The customer writes $0.00 in the tip section, so it's intentional, not a mistake.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. The user mentions that weed is illegal where they live. Even though the customer is in their own home, if they're smoking it, that's a legal issue. The driver is considering reporting them for that. But is the driver justified in doing so?\n\nOn one hand, the driver is upset about not getting tips and losing money. They might feel that the customer is being unfair. However, using the fact that the customer is smoking weed as a reason to report them could be seen as using a legal issue to get back at them for not tipping. That might not be the right approach. The driver's main grievance is the lack of tips, but they're choosing to report the customer for a different, albeit legal, reason in some places (but in this case, the user says it's illegal there). Wait, no, the user says it's illegal where they live. So if the customer is using it illegally, then technically, the driver could report them. But is the driver morally in the wrong for doing so out of spite for the lack of tips?\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). So, the key here is whether the driver's intent is to enforce the law (which is their right) or to get revenge for not getting tips. If the driver reports them for the weed use, then it's a legal report, regardless of their personal motivation. However, if the driver is using a legal issue as a cover to retaliate against the customer for not tipping, that could be seen as wrong. But the user isn't hiding it; they're asking if they'd be an asshole for reporting. The customer is breaking the law (if weed is indeed illegal there), so reporting them isn't necessarily wrong. However, the driver's primary motive is financial gain via tips, and the weed is a separate issue. So if the driver is using the legal violation to retaliate for not getting tips, that's crossing a line. Alternatively, if they are genuinely concerned about someone breaking the law, then it's their right to report. But since the driver's main issue is the tips, it's more of a personal vendetta. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're using a legal issue to get back at someone for not tipping, which is not justified. The correct approach would be to address the tipping issue with the pizza place or stop accepting $0 tips if possible, but not to report someone for a separate offense.\n"
