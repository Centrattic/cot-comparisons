Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is a delivery driver who hasn't received tips from a customer four times. The customer smells like weed each time and explicitly sets the tip to $0.00. The driver is considering reporting the customer for smoking weed, which is illegal in their area. They mention that the delivery is one of their farthest, so they lose money each time. The driver makes $5 an hour and relies on tips.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue here is whether reporting the customer for a possible drug offense is justified when the main grievance is not receiving a tip. The customer's actions (smelling like weed) might be a red herring if the real issue is the lack of tips. \n\nLegal aspect: If the customer is indeed smoking weed illegally, then reporting them isn't illegal. However, if the driver is using the weed as an excuse to target someone for not tipping, that's a different matter. The driver might be overstepping by using a potential legal violation as a way to retaliate for not getting a tip. \n\nEthically, is it right to report someone for something that's not directly affecting others? If the customer is smoking in their own home, maybe it's a private matter. Unless there's a public nuisance or a direct impact on the delivery driver (like being offered weed, which isn't the case here), the driver's motivation might be more about the tips than the drug use. \n\nAlso, the fact that the customer sets the tip to $0.00 suggests they intentionally don't want to tip, which is their choice, though it's frustrating for the driver. The driver's financial situation is tough, making tips essential. But using a legal report as a means to punish the customer for not tipping crosses a line. \n\nSo, the driver isn't necessarily in the wrong legally, but ethically, they're in a gray area. Reporting the customer for a possible drug offense when the real issue is a financial grievance might be seen as using the law for personal gain, which is wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A (in the wrong) because the motivation is more about the tips than the actual illegal activity."
