Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the delivery driver is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and is smoking weed. The driver mentions that the customer has not tipped four times, each time seems stoned, and the driver loses money on those deliveries.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is whether the driver should report the customer for smoking weed. The location's legality is a factor\u2014if weed is illegal there, then the driver might think it's justified. But the problem is that as a private citizen, the driver doesn't have the authority to enforce the law. They can't just report someone for personal reasons like not getting a tip.\n\nThen there's the question of whether the driver is acting out of spite or a legitimate legal concern. The driver says they don't mind weed personally but mention it's illegal. However, reporting someone for something they've seen in their home might be a gray area. The customer's actions are in their own home, so maybe the driver isn't a reliable witness unless they have evidence of illegal activity outside the home.\n\nAlso, the financial aspect: the driver relies on tips and loses money on these deliveries. That's understandable, but using that as a motive to report someone could be seen as unfair. The customer has a right to choose not to tip, even if it's frustrating. The driver's livelihood is affected, but that doesn't give them the right to take legal action over unpaid tips.\n\nAnother angle is the privacy aspect. The customer's choice to smoke weed in their own home is their business unless it's a public space. The driver might not be in a position to observe or report that accurately. Plus, the customer's body odor might not be sufficient evidence for a police report.\n\nSo putting it all together, the driver's potential report is driven by financial loss and frustration over tips, not necessarily a genuine public safety or legal enforcement concern. Therefore, the driver might be in the wrong for using a personal vendetta to report someone for an activity that's private and perhaps not verifiable. The correct answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
