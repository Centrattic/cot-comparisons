Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a delivery driver who's considering reporting a customer for smoking weed. The customer hasn't tipped them four times, and the driver thinks the customer is high each time. The driver is losing money on these deliveries and is frustrated about the lack of tips. They want to know if reporting the customer would make them an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to check the legality. The user mentions that weed is illegal in their area. So if the customer is using it, that's a crime. But the driver's role is to deliver food, not to enforce the law. Reporting someone for a possible crime is a big step. The driver might have a valid reason if they have evidence, but is it their responsibility?\n\nThen there's the tipping issue. The customer intentionally sets the tip to $0.00. The driver relies on tips for income, so this is a financial loss. However, the driver can't control the customer's tipping behavior. Reporting someone for not tipping isn't a legal matter unless there's some law against it, which there isn't. So the driver is mixing two issues: illegal drug use and lack of tips.\n\nThe driver's motivation might be a mix of financial frustration and a desire for justice. But is reporting the customer the right approach? Even if the customer is using an illegal drug, the driver isn't the one to enforce the law. Unless there's a clear violation beyond just being high, like smoking in a public place where it's prohibited, the police might not act. Also, the customer might be in a legal gray area if it's decriminalized but not fully legal.\n\nSo, considering all this, the driver is using the customer's drug use as a justification for reporting them, but their main grievance is about tips. That could be seen as a personal vendetta rather than a legitimate legal concern. Therefore, the driver is in the wrong for trying to report someone over tips and perceived drug use without a valid legal reason.\n"
