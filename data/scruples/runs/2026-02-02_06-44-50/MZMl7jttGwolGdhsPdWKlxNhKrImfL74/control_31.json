Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a delivery driver who hasn't received tips from a customer multiple times. The customer smells like weed each time and writes $0.00 in the tip. The driver is considering reporting them because weed is illegal where they live. The question is whether the author (the delivery driver) is in the wrong for thinking about reporting the customer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality of the situation. If smoking weed is illegal in their area, then the customer is committing a crime. The driver isn't just reporting the lack of tip, but the illegal activity. However, the driver's main grievance is the lack of tips, which affects their income. But the actual reason they might report is the illegal weed use.\n\nBut here's a catch: the driver is using the illegal activity as a reason to report someone for not tipping. Is that justified? The customer's choice to use weed, while illegal, is a private matter unless they're doing it in a public place or in a way that's observable by others. If the driver smells weed upon delivery, maybe that's a public concern. But in many places, if someone is using weed in their own home, it's not a crime unless it's visible or they're smoking in a public space. So the legality part might depend on local laws. If the customer is smoking in a way that's illegal, then the driver could report it. But if it's just the smell, maybe that's not enough. \n\nThen there's the aspect of the driver's motivation. They're upset because they lose money on each delivery to this customer and aren't getting tips. They might be using the illegal activity as leverage to get the customer to tip. That could be seen as exploiting a personal situation for financial gain, which is ethically questionable. Even if the customer is breaking the law, the driver's primary issue isn't the law but the lack of tips. So the driver's intent might be more about the tips than the illegal activity. \n\nAnother angle: Is it the driver's place to report someone for a personal grudge? Even if the customer is doing something illegal, if it's not directly affecting others or creating a disturbance, the driver's action could be seen as a personal vendetta rather than a genuine public safety concern. That could make the driver the asshole because they're using the law to target someone for not tipping, which isn't a legal issue. \n\nAlso, the customer isn't just not tipping because they're high; they actively put $0.00. The driver might feel they're being slighted, but that's a separate issue from the legal aspect. If the driver reports them for weed, it's using the law against someone who isn't causing harm beyond personal behavior. So even if the customer is breaking the law, the driver's action is driven by a personal financial issue, which could be inconsiderate.\n\nSo, putting it all together: If the customer is indeed breaking the law by using weed in a way that's illegal, then the driver isn't wrong for reporting that. But if the driver is using the illegal activity as a pretext to get the customer to tip, then they are in the wrong because they're exploiting a situation for personal gain. The key is whether the driver's main intent is to report a crime or to get a tip. Since the driver's main issue is the lack of tips, and they're using the weed as a reason, it's more about the personal financial issue, making them the asshole. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
