Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is a delivery driver who hasn't received tips from a customer four times. The customer smells like weed each time and intentionally sets the tip to $0. The driver is considering reporting them for smoking weed because it's illegal where they live. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If weed is illegal in their area, then the customer is breaking the law by using it. However, the driver's role is to deliver pizza, not to enforce the law. Reporting someone for something they observe might be within their rights, but it's a moral question. \n\nThe main issue here is the driver's motivation. The driver is upset about not getting tips and losing money on the delivery. The desire to report might be driven by the financial loss rather than genuine concern for the law. This could be seen as using the law as a tool for personal gain, which is ethically questionable. \n\nAdditionally, the customer is explicitly not tipping, not forgetting. So the driver's frustration is valid regarding income. But using illegal activity as a reason to report someone for a tip issue might be a stretch. \n\nThere's also the aspect of privacy and the driver's right to report. Even if it's illegal, the driver isn't a law enforcement officer. They might have the right to report, but whether they should is different. \n\nIn terms of being an \"asshole,\" the driver's action could be seen as taking a harsh step for a relatively minor issue (not tipping). The customer's weed use is a separate issue, but conflating the two might not be fair. \n\nSo, while the customer's actions (not tipping and using illegal substances) are problematic, the driver's intent to report might be more about the tips than the weed. Therefore, the driver could be in the wrong for using a legal issue to address a service-related grievance.\n"
