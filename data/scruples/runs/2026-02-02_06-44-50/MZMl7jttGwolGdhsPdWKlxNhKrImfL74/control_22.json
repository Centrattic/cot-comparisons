Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and is smoking weed. The situation is that the delivery driver is a pizza place worker, and the customer has not tipped four times. The customer is stoned and smells like weed each time. The driver mentions that they lose money on each delivery because it's a far location. They want to know if reporting the customer for drug use would make them an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The user says that weed is illegal where they live. So, if the customer is using marijuana, which is against the law, the driver could report them. However, the main issue here is whether the driver is justified in reporting someone for not tipping. The question is about the driver's moral responsibility.\n\nThe driver's income relies on tips, and the customer intentionally leaves $0.00. The driver is upset about losing money with each delivery. The temptation to report the customer might be to get them to tip, but the driver is using the legal violation as the reason. This seems like a misuse of the law for personal gain. Even if the customer is breaking the law, the driver's primary motive is about the tip, not the drug use. \n\nIn many places, it's illegal to report someone falsely to the police. So if the driver's main reason is to get a tip, that could be considered a false report, which is a crime. Additionally, using the police to enforce tipping is not appropriate. The customer's choice to use weed might be their personal business, even if it's illegal, and the driver isn't in a position to enforce that unless there's a direct threat or danger. \n\nAlso, the customer's actions (smelling like weed and being high) don't necessarily mean they are actively using in a public place. Just being under the influence doesn't equate to illegal activity unless there's actual consumption or possession on the premises. The driver might not have concrete evidence of illegal activity beyond their observations, which could be subjective.\n\nSo, the driver's intention to report the customer is mainly for the tip, which is a personal financial issue, not a public safety concern. Therefore, the driver is in the wrong because they are considering using the law as a means to get money from the customer, which is unethical and possibly illegal. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
