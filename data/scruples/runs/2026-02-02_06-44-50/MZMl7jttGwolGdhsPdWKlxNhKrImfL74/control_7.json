Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're a bad person (WIBTA) for reporting a customer to the police because the customer didn't tip them multiple times and seemed high on weed. The key points here are that the customer has left zero tips four times, the driver loses money on these deliveries, and they want to know if reporting the customer for smoking weed is justified.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The main issue is the motivation behind the report. The customer's weed use is illegal, but the driver's intent is to get a tip. So, they're using the illegal activity as a reason to report the customer, not because of any harm caused by the smoking itself. \n\nThe question is about whether the driver's action is morally wrong. Legally, if the customer is indeed using an illegal substance, the driver might be right to report it. But ethically, if the driver's main reason is to get a tip, that could be seen as using the law for personal gain. The driver says they don't personally have a problem with weed, so maybe their issue isn't with the customer's choice but with the lack of tip. \n\nAlso, the customer is writing $0.00 in the tip section. That's intentional, not forgetting. The driver's income relies on tips, so losing money on these deliveries is a real issue. But does that justify reporting someone for a non-violent, personal activity? It depends on the driver's intent. If they're trying to get a tip by getting the customer in trouble, that's using the police for something that's not a direct threat or harm to them. \n\nOn the other hand, if the customer's behavior is affecting the driver's work, like being aggressive or causing delays, that's different. But the situation here is about the customer being high and not tipping. The driver is in a tough spot financially, which adds context. However, the right thing to do legally and ethically might be separate. The driver isn't in the wrong legally if the report is truthful, but ethically, it's questionable because the motivation is personal financial gain rather than public safety. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because their intent is to coerce a tip through reporting an illegal activity, which is not the right reason to involve the police. The correct action might be to not report and instead handle it through the delivery platform if there's a policy against zero tips, but since the question is about the wrongness of reporting due to the weed use, the intent is the main factor here.\n"
