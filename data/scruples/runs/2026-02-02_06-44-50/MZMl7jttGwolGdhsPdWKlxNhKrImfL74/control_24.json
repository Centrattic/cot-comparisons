Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a delivery driver asking if they're in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who hasn't tipped them multiple times and seems to be smoking weed. \n\nFirst, the legal aspect. The customer is smoking weed, which is illegal where they live. If the driver reports them, it's a legal issue. But the main question is whether the driver is in the wrong for doing so. \n\nThe user's motivation is financial. They lose money on each delivery to this customer, and the customer deliberately tips $0.00. The driver relies on tips, so this is affecting their income. However, using a legal issue as a means to get a tip could be seen as unethical. \n\nOn one hand, the driver isn't supposed to use their job to enforce laws; that's the police's job. If the driver reports the customer just because they're not tipping, it might be considered misuse of the reporting system. On the other hand, the customer is breaking the law, so reporting them isn't inherently wrong. \n\nBut the key point here is the driver's intent. If the primary reason is to get a tip, then they might be in the wrong. However, if they genuinely believe the customer is committing a crime and report them for that reason, regardless of the tip, then they're not in the wrong. \n\nThe user mentions that the customer smells of weed and is stoned each time, which could be evidence of illegal activity. So the driver has a legitimate concern. However, the driver's main grievance is the lack of tips. Mixing these motives complicates things. \n\nIn many cases, using someone's illegal activity as a way to get money back is considered unethical. The driver should address the tip issue directly, maybe through the employer or by refusing service, but not necessarily involving the police for a legal violation that isn't directly related to the tip. \n\nSo, the answer likely leans towards the driver being in the wrong if their primary motive is to get a tip. But if they're genuinely concerned about the law, then maybe not. However, given the context, the main issue is the tip, so the answer is probably A (they are in the wrong).\n"
