Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a delivery driver who's been delivering to a customer multiple times. The customer hasn't tipped them four times, and each time the customer seems stoned and smells like weed. The driver is considering reporting the customer for smoking weed, which is illegal in their area. They mention that they don't have a problem with weed personally but are upset because the customer's choice costs them money on each delivery, especially since the delivery is far and they lose money. The main question is whether the author is wrong for considering reporting the customer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. If smoking weed is indeed illegal where they are, then the customer is breaking the law. The driver isn't making a judgment about the customer's personal choice but is pointing out a potential illegal activity. However, there's a nuance here: the driver is choosing to report someone specifically because they're a non-tipping customer. That could be seen as using the law to retaliate for not getting tips, which might be problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, the driver is in a legal profession (delivery) and is within their rights to report illegal activities they observe. The fact that the customer is not tipping is a separate issue. But if the driver is using the police to address a personal financial grievance, that's where the line might be crossed. The driver could be seen as using law enforcement for a non-legal matter, which is not appropriate. \n\nAlso, the driver mentions that the customer doesn't forget to tip but intentionally writes $0.00. So it's not a case of the customer being negligent but rather choosing not to tip. However, that doesn't change the fact that reporting someone for smoking weed (if it's illegal) is a matter for law enforcement, not personal vendettas. \n\nThe key points are: 1) Reporting an illegal activity (if it's indeed illegal), which the driver has a right to do, but 2) the motivation behind the report (non-payment of tips) could make the driver's intent questionable. The line between reporting a crime and using the law to settle a personal issue is important here. If the driver's primary motivation is to get the customer to tip, then it's likely wrong. But if they're genuinely concerned about the illegal activity, it's a different matter. \n\nHowever, the driver's statement that they lose money on each delivery and need tips to make a living might indicate that their primary motivation is financial. So, while the act of reporting is technically legal, the intent might be self-serving and not in good faith. That could make the driver in the wrong because they're exploiting the legal system for personal gain rather than public safety.\n"
