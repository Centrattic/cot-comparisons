Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a pizza delivery driver who's asking if they're wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and is clearly smoking weed. The customer hasn't tipped four times, each time the driver noticed them being stoned and smelling of weed. The driver is losing money on these deliveries and makes $5 an hour plus tips.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: if weed is illegal in their area, then the customer is breaking the law by smoking it. But the driver is considering reporting someone for a non-violent, personal activity that's illegal. The question is whether the driver is justified in reporting this. \n\nThe main issue here is whether the driver's motivation is appropriate. The driver is primarily upset about not receiving tips and losing money. They might be using the weed as a reason to report the customer, but is that a valid reason? Reporting someone for a personal reason like not getting tipped could be seen as a misuse of authority or overstepping, even if the activity is illegal.\n\nAlso, the customer is actively writing $0.00 in the tip, which is intentional. The driver feels it's unfair because they rely on tips. However, the customer isn't legally obligated to tip. The driver's job is to deliver the pizza, and the customer can choose to tip or not. \n\nSo, the driver is considering reporting the customer for an illegal act (smoking weed) but the main grievance is about the lack of tips. The legality of weed is separate from the tipping issue. However, using the illegal activity as a leverage for personal gain (more tips) could be seen as hypocritical or exploiting a situation. \n\nIn some cases, people might report others for minor infractions out of spite or personal gain, which isn't fair. The driver might be in the wrong here because their primary motivation is financial gain from the situation rather than upholding the law for the public good. \n\nBut if the driver genuinely believes that the customer is breaking the law and is willing to report for that reason, then maybe it's not wrong. However, the context here is that the driver is frustrated with the lack of tips. The line between personal vendetta and legitimate reporting is thin. \n\nSo, considering the motivations and the potential misuse of the reporting system for personal grievances, the answer would likely be that the driver is in the wrong. The correct choice would be A.\n"
