Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're an asshole for reporting a customer who doesn't tip and is clearly under the influence of weed. The customer hasn't tipped four times, each time marked as $0.00, and the driver feels it's intentional, not just forgetfulness. The driver loses money on these deliveries and relies heavily on tips since they make $5 an hour.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. The customer is smoking weed where it's illegal. So if the driver reports them, the police would check if there's a violation. But does the driver have a legal right to report someone just for not tipping? Probably not. The police might not get involved in a tip dispute. However, if the driver can provide evidence of illegal activity (smell of weed, maybe even a video), then maybe there's a case. But the main issue here is whether the driver is justified in using the tip issue as a way to report someone for drug use.\n\nEthically, the driver is in a tough spot. They need the tips to make a living, and the customer is being intentionally stingy. But using that as a reason to report someone for something else (drug use) could be seen as a vendetta. The driver might be conflating two issues: the lack of tips and the illegal activity. Even if the customer is doing something illegal, is it right to use that as a way to retaliate for not getting a tip?\n\nAlso, the customer's choice to use drugs is their own, but if it's illegal, then technically the driver could report them. However, the driver's motivation here is financial. So the question is whether the driver's intent is to enforce the law or to get revenge for not being tipped. If it's the latter, then the driver might be in the wrong. The police might not appreciate being used as a tool for personal grievances.\n\nAnother angle: the customer is an adult making their own choices. The driver's job is to deliver the pizza, and the customer's drug use isn't directly affecting the service (order is correct, on time). The driver isn't in a position to enforce laws; that's the police's job. Unless there's a safety concern, like the customer being impaired to the point of danger, which isn't indicated here, the driver might be overstepping by reporting them for something they're not responsible for policing.\n\nSo, considering all that, the driver's primary grievance is the lack of tips. Reporting the customer for drug use as a result of that could be seen as using the law to settle a personal complaint about tips, which is not appropriate. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
