Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the delivery driver is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who smokes weed but doesn't tip. First, I need to break down the situation.\n\nThe driver works for a pizza place and makes $5 an hour, relying on tips. The customer in question hasn't tipped four times, and each time, the driver noticed the customer was stoned and smelled of weed. The driver is wondering if reporting the customer is justified.\n\nNow, the key points here are about the legality of weed in their area. If weed is illegal where they live, then the customer could be breaking the law by using it. But the driver's main issue is the lack of tips. The customer isn't just forgetting; they're intentionally putting $0.00. The driver feels financially affected because this is a far delivery, leading to a loss.\n\nBut wait, the driver's primary job is to deliver pizza. The customer's actions (smoking weed) aren't directly affecting the delivery service\u2014order accuracy and punctuality are good. The driver's motivation here is financial gain, using the potential illegal activity as a reason to report someone who isn't tipping. That might be a conflict of interest. \n\nAlso, is it ethical to report someone for a personal gain? Even if the action is legal, the intent matters. The driver isn't justifying it because of harm caused by the customer's weed use but because of the lack of tips. So, the driver's priority is their income over the customer's privacy or personal choice. \n\nMoreover, in many places, even if weed is illegal, the police might not prioritize such cases unless there's a direct violation during the delivery. Plus, the driver is a private citizen reporting a customer based on suspicion, which might not be the best approach. \n\nSo, the driver's actions might be seen as using a legal technicality to get tips, which is exploiting the situation rather than focusing on their job duties. That could make the driver in the wrong, as they're using someone's personal habits against them for financial gain.\n"
