Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person is wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip them and is smoking weed, right? Let me break down the details.\n\nThe person is a delivery driver. They mention that the customer hasn't tipped them four times, and each time the customer was stoned and smelled of weed. The driver is okay with people smoking weed personally, but it's illegal where they live. Also, the delivery is far, so they lose money each time. The customer doesn't forget the tip; they enter $0.00. The driver makes $5 an hour and relies on tips.\n\nNow, the main issue here is whether reporting the customer for smoking weed is justified. The driver is upset about not getting tips and losing money. But the customer is doing something illegal (since weed is illegal there), so maybe the driver is right to report? But wait, is the driver allowed to report someone just because they don't like them? Or is this a case of using the law as a tool for personal gain?\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the customer is doing something illegal (smoking weed where it's prohibited). The driver has a right to report illegal activities. On the other hand, the driver's motivation might be financial. They might be using the police to get the customer to tip, which could be seen as misuse of the legal system. Also, the customer's actions (smelling of weed) might not be enough evidence for law enforcement to act. Plus, the driver might be infringing on the customer's privacy by reporting them for something that's their personal choice, even if it's illegal.\n\nBut the law is the law. If the customer is indeed breaking the law, then the driver isn't necessarily wrong for reporting. However, if the driver is doing it out of spite or to get the customer to tip, that's a different matter. There's also the aspect of whether the driver is overstepping by turning a personal grievance into a legal matter. It's possible that the authorities wouldn't take action unless there's clear evidence, so the report might be a hassle without real consequences for the customer.\n\nSo, is the driver in the wrong? If they're using the report as a means to get money from the customer (tips), that's unethical. But if they genuinely believe the customer is breaking the law and report them for that reason, then they might not be in the wrong. The line here is blurry. The driver's main complaint is about not getting tips and losing money, so the report could be a way to pressure the customer into tipping by threatening police action. That would be using the law as a tool for personal gain, which is wrong. But if the driver is just doing their duty by reporting illegal activity, then it's not wrong. However, the customer's actions (smelling of weed) might not be sufficient for a report. The driver isn't a cop, so they can report suspected illegal activity, but they might be overreaching here.\n\nI think the key is the driver's intent. If their primary motivation is to get tips, then it's wrong. If it's because they want to enforce the law, maybe not. But since the tips are the main issue here, the driver's motivation is likely mixed. Also, the driver is in a position to report due to their job, but that doesn't mean they should use that power for personal reasons. So, I lean towards the author being in the wrong because they're using the threat of legal action to get financial compensation, which is exploiting their position.\n"
