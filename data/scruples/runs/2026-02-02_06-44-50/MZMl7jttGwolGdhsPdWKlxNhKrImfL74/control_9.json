Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and is often high on weed. \n\nFirst, the customer hasn't tipped multiple times, which is a problem for the driver since tips are a big part of their income. The driver mentions losing money on each delivery because it's a far location. The customer smells strongly of weed and is clearly under the influence when ordering. \n\nThe key points here are the legality of weed in the area and the driver's right to report someone. Even if the driver is okay with personal drug use, they're concerned about the customer breaking the law. If weed is illegal, then the customer could be violating possession or public consumption laws. Reporting someone for illegal activity isn't inherently wrong, but the driver's motivation is also about the lack of tips and financial loss.\n\nI need to consider if the driver's primary reason for reporting is the weed use, which is illegal, versus the tips, which are a personal grievance. If the driver is using the weed as an excuse to report the customer for not tipping, that could be seen as wrong. But if the weed use is a legitimate legal issue, then reporting might be justified. However, the driver's main complaint is about the tips and the money lost, which is more about personal gain than public safety. \n\nAlso, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on the context. Legally, if the customer is using an illegal substance, the driver isn't breaking the law by reporting. But ethically, is it right to report someone for not tipping? That's a different angle. The driver might be seen as exploiting a legal issue to address a personal financial problem, which could be considered unethical. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the person is reporting illegal activity, but some might argue the driver's real issue is the lack of tips, making it a case of using the law for personal gain. However, if the weed use is indeed illegal, then the report is legitimate regardless of the driver's motivations. The question is about being in the \"wrong,\" so if the action itself is legal, the driver isn't technically in the wrong. But maybe there's a moral aspect. The user says they don't have a problem with weed personally, so it's not about prejudice. The main conflict is the unpaid tips and financial loss. \n\nIn the end, the driver is within their rights to report the customer for possible drug-related offenses. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
