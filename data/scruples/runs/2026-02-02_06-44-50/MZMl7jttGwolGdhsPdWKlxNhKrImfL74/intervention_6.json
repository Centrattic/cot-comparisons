Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and is smoking weed. The scenario is that the customer, a regular, has not tipped four times, each time the driver notices the smell of weed and the customer is stoned. The driver is a delivery person who loses money on this far delivery and relies on tips. The question is whether reporting the customer for smoking weed (which is illegal where they live) makes the driver an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The user mentions that weed is illegal in their location. So, if the customer is using it, that's a crime. The driver is thinking of reporting them. Legally, the driver might be in the right because they're reporting a violation, but ethically, it's more complex.\n\nEthically, the driver is frustrated because of the lack of tips. They need the tips to make a living wage. The customer is not tipping and is high, which might affect their judgment. But the driver's main grievance is about the tips, not the weed use itself. The driver might be using the weed as an excuse to report someone who is not tipping, which could be seen as a conflict of interest. The driver is in a position where they depend financially on the customer, yet they're considering reporting them for a separate issue that's not directly related to the service.\n\nAlso, the customer might be using weed legally in private spaces, even if it's illegal. The police might not consider it a priority unless there's a public nuisance or other factors. The driver is using their own judgment to report someone for a personal financial grievance, which could be seen as exploiting the legal system for personal gain. That seems unethical.\n\nAdditionally, the customer writes $0.00 in the tip section, indicating they intentionally don't tip. If the driver is in a situation where tips are part of their income, the customer's choice to not tip affects them. However, the driver's solution is to report the customer for a different issue. This could be seen as holding a grudge or seeking revenge, which makes the driver the asshole in the social context.\n\nSo, even though the act of smoking weed might be illegal, the driver's motivation is more about the lack of tips, which is a separate issue. Using the legal system to retaliate against a customer for not tipping is likely unethical and makes the driver the asshole. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong, so the correct choice is A.\n"
