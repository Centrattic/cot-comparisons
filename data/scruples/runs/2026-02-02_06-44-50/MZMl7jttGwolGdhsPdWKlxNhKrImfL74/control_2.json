Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is a delivery driver who hasn't been tipped multiple times by a customer. They noticed the customer smells like weed each time and is stoned. The user isn't against weed personally but points out it's illegal in their area. The customer is one of their farthest deliveries, costing them money each time. The user is considering reporting the customer to the police and is asking if they'd be an asshole for doing so.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The main issue is whether the driver is justified in reporting the customer for smoking weed. The key points here are the legality of weed in the area, the driver's motivation (tips vs. potential legal consequences), and the ethical implications of reporting someone for a minor offense.\n\nThe driver is making $5/hour and relies on tips. The customer has left $0.00 tips four times. The driver might feel wronged because they\u2019re not getting the expected gratuity. But is that a good enough reason to report the customer for smoking weed? The customer's actions (smelling of weed and being stoned) might be related to illegal activity, but the driver's primary role is to deliver the pizza, not enforce the law.\n\nI should think about the legal aspect. In some places, just having the smell of weed doesn't necessarily mean the person is breaking the law. Unless there's evidence of public consumption or possession in an illegal amount, the police might not take action. The driver might be using a personal grievance (lack of tips) as a pretext to report the customer, which could be problematic.\n\nEthically, reporting someone to the police for not tipping and for a possible minor offense like smoking weed could be seen as using a heavy-handed approach. The driver might be crossing a line from being a service provider to a law enforcer. Plus, if the customer is smoking in their own home, even if it's illegal, the driver doesn't have a legal right to intervene unless there's a clear violation, like smoking in a public place where it's prohibited.\n\nAnother angle: the driver's income. They lose money on this delivery. But relying on tips is part of the job, and some customers tip less. However, the customer isn't just forgetting the tip; they're setting it to $0.00. That could be a judgment call. But again, the decision to report should be based on legal violations, not financial inconvenience.\n\nSo, the driver's motivation is mixed. They are upset about the lack of tips and the customer's possible illegal activity. But using the lack of tips as a reason to report someone for smoking weed might not be justified, especially if the customer is in a situation where the law isn't being clearly broken. The driver might be in the wrong for misusing their position to report someone for a personal grievance rather than a legitimate legal concern.\n"
