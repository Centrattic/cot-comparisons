Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're a bad person (WIBTA) for considering reporting a customer to the police because the customer doesn't tip and is smoking weed. The key points here are:\n\n1. The customer hasn't tipped four times, each time specifying $0.00. The driver relies on tips, especially since they make $5 an hour, which is pretty low.\n2. The customer is smoking weed, which is illegal in their area. The driver notices the smell each time and thinks the customer is stoned.\n3. The delivery is far, so the driver loses money on each trip.\n\nFirst, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for considering reporting the customer. The answer is either A (yes) or B (no). \n\nThe main issue here is the justification for reporting someone for smoking weed in a private residence. If the customer is smoking weed in their own home, even if it's illegal, the police might not act unless there's a public disturbance or visible consumption in a prohibited area. However, in some places, just having weed in your home is illegal regardless of the situation. \n\nThe driver's motivation is not just about the weed but also the lack of tips. They might be using the weed as a reason to report someone who they feel is taking advantage of their service without tipping. However, using a legal violation as a pretext for reporting someone, especially when the primary grievance is about tips, could be problematic. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the driver's own interests. They're losing money on each delivery because of the distance. If the customer is not tipping, it's affecting their income. But is it right to report someone to the police over unpaid tips? That seems more like a civil issue rather than a criminal one. The police probably wouldn't get involved in a tip dispute unless there's an argument or harassment involved. \n\nAdditionally, the driver is aware that the customer is smoking weed, which is illegal. If they report them, it's a matter of whether they're acting on a legitimate suspicion. However, the driver isn't a law enforcement officer, so they can't enforce the law themselves. They can report suspected illegal activity, but the police would decide if there's enough evidence. \n\nBut if the driver's primary reason for reporting is the lack of tips, even though they know the customer is doing something illegal, that could be seen as using the law for personal gain. It's a conflict of interest. The driver might be in the wrong because they're not just reporting a crime but using it as a way to get the tips they feel they deserve. \n\nOn the other hand, if the driver is genuinely concerned about the illegal activity and isn't motivated by the tips, then it's a different scenario. But given the context, the user mentions both the weed and the tips as reasons. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because the primary motivation seems to be about the tips, which is not a legal justification for reporting someone. Using a legal violation as a pretext for a personal financial grievance is not appropriate. The driver should address the tip issue through the appropriate channels (like the employer, if possible) rather than involving the police.\n"
