Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is a delivery driver who hasn't received tips from a customer multiple times, and they suspect the customer is smoking weed, which is illegal where they live. The driver is considering reporting the customer to the police. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the main points here are about tipping and potential illegal activity. The customer isn't tipping, which affects the driver's income since they rely on tips. The driver thinks the customer is smoking weed, which is illegal. The key issue is whether reporting someone for not tipping and possibly using an illegal substance is justified.\n\nNow, legally, if the customer is using an illegal drug, then that's a matter for law enforcement. However, the driver's evidence is based on the customer smelling like weed and being stoned. That might not be solid evidence for a police report. The police usually need more concrete proof than just an odor, unless there are other signs like paraphernalia or visible drugs. Also, the customer explicitly put $0.00 in the tip, so it's intentional, not a forgetful mistake.\n\nEthically, the driver is in a tough spot. They depend on tips for their livelihood, and this customer is costing them money with far deliveries and no tips. But reporting someone for drug use based on suspicion could be seen as a privacy violation or misuse of authority. The driver isn't in a position to enforce the law; that's the police's job. However, if the driver genuinely believes there's illegal activity, they might feel they have a duty to report it.\n\nBut wait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author reports the customer solely because of the lack of tips and the suspicion of drug use, without solid evidence, that could be considered a false report or an overstep. However, if the driver is genuinely concerned about illegal activity, maybe they're not entirely wrong. But the primary motive here seems to be the financial loss from tips, which complicates things. It might come across as using the drug suspicion as a pretext for the tip issue.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical angles: the driver isn't legally obligated to accept the customer's behavior, but reporting based on insufficient evidence might be problematic. Ethically, it's questionable to involve police for a civil matter (tip not given) under the guise of illegal activity. Therefore, the author's actions could be seen as wrong because they're using a potential illegal activity as a means to address a personal financial grievance, without sufficient proof. The answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
