Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong if they report someone who hasn't tipped them multiple times and seems to be smoking weed.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author is a delivery driver who delivers to a customer several times. The customer didn't tip four times, and each time, the driver noticed the customer was stoned and smelled like weed. The author isn't against weed personally but points out it's illegal where they live. Also, this customer is one of their farthest deliveries, so it costs them money each time. The author is considering reporting the customer to the police because they need tips to survive, making $5 an hour.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong by reporting the customer. Let's consider the legal and ethical aspects. \n\nLegally, if the customer is using weed in a place where it's illegal, then the author might have a valid reason to report them. However, the author's motivation here is not just about the law but also about the lack of tips. The tip is a separate issue. Even if someone is using an illegal substance, not tipping them doesn't automatically justify reporting them, unless there's a direct link between the illegal activity and the tip. The author might be conflating two separate issues: personal income and someone else's illegal activity.\n\nEthically, reporting someone for not tipping because they're high could be seen as using the law as a leverage for personal gain. The author's primary responsibility is to provide service, and they can't control the customer's personal actions unless there's a violation of the law that's observable and reportable. However, if the customer is using weed in a public place where it's illegal, maybe the author could make a report, but the underlying motivation is to get a tip, which complicates things.\n\nAlso, the customer is writing $0.00 in the tip, not forgetting. So the author isn't losing tips due to forgetfulness but because the customer intentionally doesn't tip. That's a separate issue. The author could handle it by maybe avoiding that delivery if it's costing them money, but reporting for a drug violation might be crossing a line.\n\nAnother angle: The author is in a service role. Customers have the right to not tip, even if they're high. The author can't force someone to tip, even if they're under the influence. Reporting someone to the police for not tipping them because they're using an illegal substance might be considered an asshole move, as it's using the law for personal financial gain rather than genuine safety or legal concerns.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, if the customer is violating the law, the author could report them, but ethically, doing so for the reason of not receiving tips might be wrong. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong because they're using the illegal activity as a means to get a tip, which is not the appropriate use of the legal system. Hence, answer A.\n"
