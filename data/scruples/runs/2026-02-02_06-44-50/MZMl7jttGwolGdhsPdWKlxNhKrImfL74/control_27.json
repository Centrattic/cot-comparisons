      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the original question is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who hasn't tipped them multiple times and was smoking weed. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is a delivery driver who works for a pizza place. The customer in question has not tipped them four times, and each time, the customer was stoned and smelled like weed. The author mentions that the customer explicitly writes $0.00 in the tip section, not that they forgot. The author is in a situation where this customer is one of the farthest deliveries, which means they lose money on each delivery. The author is considering reporting the customer because they believe smoking weed is illegal in their area. They also mention that they don't have a personal issue with weed but see it as someone's choice, even though it's against the law.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering this report. Let's consider the legal and ethical angles. Legally, if marijuana use is indeed illegal in that jurisdiction, then using or possessing it could be a matter for law enforcement. However, the author's role as a delivery driver doesn't necessarily grant them the authority to report someone for personal gain. The author's motivation here seems to be twofold: the customer's failure to tip and the desire to report the weed use. \n\nEthically, there's a conflict here. The author is being paid for their job, and part of their income is from tips. Not getting tipped could be frustrating, especially if it's affecting their earnings. However, using that as a reason to report someone for a personal issue might cross a line. It's important to note that the author is not a law enforcement officer, so their duty isn't to enforce laws but to perform their job. Reporting someone for not tipping could be seen as a misuse of their position, especially if the primary reason is to get the customer into trouble over a personal vendetta.\n\nAdditionally, the customer's actions of not tipping are separate from their personal drug use. Even if the customer is smoking weed, the author's response should focus on their own job performance and the customer's behavior related to the service. The author might have other options, like addressing the customer about the tipping or discussing it with their employer, but reporting to the police could be seen as overstepping.\n\nAnother angle is the potential consequences. If the police decide not to act on the report because the evidence isn't sufficient (just the smell of weed and the customer's state), the author could be seen as making a false report. That could lead to legal repercussions for the author. Also, the customer could file a complaint against the author for harassment or retaliation if they feel targeted because of the no-tipping issue.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author genuinely believes that the customer is violating the law by using an illegal substance, they might feel they have a duty to report it. However, this duty isn't typically extended to private citizens to enforce laws that aren't directly affecting them. It's more about public safety issues where there's a risk to others. If the customer's weed use isn't affecting the delivery or the author's safety, then it's a personal matter.\n\nIn summary, while the author has legitimate concerns about their income and the customer's failure to tip, using that as a reason to report the customer for legal activities (assuming weed use is illegal) could be ethically problematic. The author is prioritizing personal gain over the customer's privacy and autonomy, which could make them the wrong party. However, if the author truly believes the law is being broken and acts in good faith, there might be a different perspective. But given the context, the primary issue is the tipping, and the report seems motivated by that rather than genuine public safety concerns.\n"
