Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a delivery driver who hasn't received tips from a customer multiple times, and each time the customer was smoking weed. The user is considering reporting them because it's illegal in their area. They mention that the customer writes $0.00 in the tip section, so it's not a mistake. The user relies heavily on tips since they make $5 an hour.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The main issue here is the legality of the customer's actions. If weed is illegal where they live, then smoking it is against the law. However, the user's motivation is primarily about not getting tipped. The question is whether the user's intent to report the customer for not tipping is justified, or if they are using the weed as an excuse to retaliate.\n\nReporting someone to the police should be based on actual illegal activity, not just personal grievances. Even if the customer is smoking weed, if the user's main reason for reporting is the lack of tips, that could be seen as misuse of the legal system. The user might be using the weed as a pretext to get even, which would be wrong. On the other hand, if the user honestly believes the customer is committing a crime by using illegal substances, they might have a valid reason. But since weed laws vary, it's important to note the legality in their specific area.\n\nAlso, the user mentions they lose money on each delivery to this customer, which adds to their frustration. However, that doesn't justify reporting someone for a different reason. The right thing would be to address the tipping issue directly, maybe by talking to the customer or the pizza place's management, rather than involving the police over an illegal activity that isn't directly related to the tipping issue. So, the user's intent to report for not tipping by using the weed as a reason makes them the asshole because they're using the legal system for personal gain.\n"
