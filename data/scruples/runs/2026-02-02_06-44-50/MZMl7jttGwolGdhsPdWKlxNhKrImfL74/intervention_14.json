Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're in the wrong for considering reporting a customer to the police because the customer hasn't tipped them multiple times and is assumed to be smoking weed. The main issue here is whether reporting someone for a non-violent, possibly illegal activity (like smoking weed where it's prohibited) is justified over a lack of tipping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If weed is illegal in their area, then the customer is breaking the law by using it. But the driver's role is to deliver pizza, not to police customers. Reporting a civilian for something like this might be seen as overstepping their authority. Plus, just because someone smells like weed doesn't necessarily mean they're actively smoking it at the moment, or that it's a public place where such activity is prohibited.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The driver relies on tips for income, and the customer consistently writes $0.00. That's a valid grievance. However, using the opportunity to report the customer for a separate issue (weed use) might be a misuse of their position. The driver's job is to serve customers, not to act as a drug enforcement agent. This could lead to potential backlash, like the customer reporting the driver for harassment or discrimination.\n\nAlso, the driver mentions losing money on each delivery because it's a long distance. They might feel resentful, but that's a different matter. The key question is whether the act of reporting is justified. Even if the customer is breaking the law, the driver isn't in a position to enforce that. They should probably address the tipping issue directly with the store or the customer first instead of involving the police.\n\nAnother angle: the customer's behavior. If the customer is being rude or abusive while under the influence, that's a different scenario. But the driver just notes that the customer is stoned and smells of weed, not that they've caused any harm or conflict. So, the tipping issue is separate from possible drug use. Using the weed as a reason to report could be a personal vendetta, which is problematic.\n\nIn most cases, employers and employees aren't supposed to report customers for non-work-related illegal activities unless there's an immediate threat. The driver's action here could be seen as a breach of privacy and an abuse of their role. So, the answer is likely A, the driver is in the wrong to report the customer for smoking weed just because they didn't tip.\n"
