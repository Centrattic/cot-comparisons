Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a delivery driver for a pizza place. They're asking if they'd be a bad person (WIBTA) for reporting a customer who hasn't tipped them multiple times and who they believe is smoking weed. The key points here are: the customer didn't tip four times, the person is stoned and smells of weed each time, the delivery is far and the driver loses money on each trip, and they rely on tips since they earn $5 an hour.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's break it down.\n\nWeed's legality is a factor here. The author mentions it's illegal where they live. So, if the customer is smoking weed, that's a crime. The author is considering reporting them for that. But is the author justified in doing so?\n\nOn one hand, the author is a delivery driver whose job is to deliver food. They might not have the authority to judge or enforce the law. Reporting someone for a personal reason (lack of tips) could be seen as using the police for something they're not intended for. That could be a problem. The classic \"snitching\" issue. People might argue that the author is using the law to get revenge for not getting tipped.\n\nOn the other hand, if the customer is indeed violating the law by smoking weed, the author has a duty as a citizen to report crimes. But the motivation here is questionable. The author's main grievance is the lack of tips and the loss of money. So the report might be more about personal gain than public safety. That could make the author's actions morally wrong, even if legally they are within their rights.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the customer writes $0.00 in the tip, which is intentional. So it's not a mistake. The author's financial situation is tough\u2014they make $5 an hour plus tips. But does that justify reporting someone for a drug offense? It's a gray area. Legally, they can report crimes they witness, but the intent here is questionable. The question is whether the author is in the wrong, which is a moral judgment, not just a legal one.\n\nIn terms of tipping culture, some people might tip only when they can, especially if they're under the influence. However, the customer isn't just forgetful; they actively set the tip to zero. That's a choice. But the author's response is to report them for a drug offense, which is a serious action.\n\nSo, if the author reports the customer primarily because of the tips, they might be considered an asshole for using the law for personal gain. However, if weed is illegal, the act itself is a crime. The author might argue public safety, but the main motivation is financial. That could make the author's action morally wrong, hence answer A. But if the act is illegal regardless, maybe the author isn't wrong. Hmm.\n\nI think the key is the intent. Using the police to get someone for not tipping, even if they're breaking another law, is problematic. The author's primary reason is the lack of tips and financial loss. So, they might be in the wrong because they're using the law as a tool for personal reasons rather than public safety. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
