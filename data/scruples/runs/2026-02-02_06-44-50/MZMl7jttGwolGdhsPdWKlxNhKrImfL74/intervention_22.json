Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the delivery driver is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and is smoking weed. The customer hasn't tipped four times, writes $0.00 each time, and the driver feels they're losing money on those deliveries because the customer is far away. The driver also mentions that the customer smells like weed, which is illegal where they live.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality of marijuana. If it's illegal in the area, then the customer could be violating the law by smoking it. However, the driver is a delivery person and might not be in a position to enforce the law. Reporting someone for using illegal substances could be seen as overstepping, especially if the driver's main issue is the tipping. \n\nThe driver's main complaint is about the lack of tips. The customer isn't forgetting to tip; they actively set it to zero. The driver relies on tips, which is common in many service jobs. But using that as a reason to report someone for a separate issue (weed use) might be a stretch. It could be seen as using the law as leverage for better tips, which isn't appropriate.\n\nAlso, the driver might not have a valid reason to report the customer. Unless they observe the customer using weed in a public place where it's prohibited, or if there's a direct safety concern, the driver's role isn't to police others. It's possible the customer is in their own home, which is their right as long as legal. Even if it's illegal, the driver isn't a law enforcement officer and shouldn't act as one.\n\nThe question is whether the driver is in the wrong. If they report the customer based on the weed smell, but their real motive is the lack of tips, then they might be misusing the legal system for personal gain. That would make them in the wrong. However, if the driver genuinely believes the customer is violating the law and is reporting for legitimate reasons, maybe not. But the context here is more about tips.\n\nSo, considering the possible misuse of the law here, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong). They're using a legal charge as a way to get the customer to tip more, which is not their role. The driver should focus on their job and perhaps address the tipping issue through their employer or by not delivering if necessary, but not reporting a legal matter over a financial dispute.\n"
