Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a delivery driver who hasn't received tips from a customer four times. Each time, the customer was smoking weed, which is illegal where they live. The driver is considering reporting the customer to the police because of this. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to report someone for not tipping because they were smoking weed.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legality. If weed is illegal in that location, then the customer's actions could be a crime. However, as a delivery driver, the driver isn't a law enforcement officer. Reporting someone for smoking weed could be seen as overstepping if the driver isn't sure whether the customer is actually violating the law or if there's a misunderstanding. Plus, the driver's primary issue is the lack of tips, not the weed use.\n\nNext, the driver's motivation is financial. They lose money on this delivery and rely on tips. But using the illegal activity as a reason to report the customer because of the unpaid tips might be crossing a line. The driver's right to tips isn't directly tied to the customer's personal drug use. Even if the customer isn't tipping, that's a separate issue from the legality of their actions. However, if the customer is indeed breaking the law, the driver might feel justified in reporting them, but that's a gray area.\n\nAlso, the customer actively writes $0.00 instead of forgetting, which shows intent. But the driver's personal choice to report based on the customer's drug use could lead to potential issues. There's a risk of false accusations if the customer isn't actually breaking the law. The driver might not have concrete evidence beyond the smell of weed, which could be subjective.\n\nEthically, the driver is balancing financial loss against the customer's rights. While the driver has a right to pursue tips, using the illegal activity as a means to get them might not be ethical. The driver might be using the situation to their advantage, which could be seen as exploiting the customer's personal choices. On the other hand, if the customer is indeed violating the law, the driver has a duty to report it, but that's a legal perspective, not necessarily an ethical one.\n\nIn summary, the driver's main issue is the lack of tips, but using the fact that the customer was smoking weed (if indeed illegal) to report them could be crossing into being an asshole. The driver's motivation is financial gain rather than genuine concern for the law, which complicates the ethics of the situation. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for wanting to report the customer primarily for the unpaid tips, using the weed as an excuse.\n"
