Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and is clearly under the influence. The key points here are that the customer has refused to tip four times, the driver loses money on each delivery, and the customer is smoking weed, which is illegal in their location.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If weed is illegal where they are and the customer is using it, then the driver could be within their rights to report them. However, just because something is illegal doesn't mean it's acceptable to report someone for it, especially for a personal grudge. The driver is upset about not receiving tips, which is a financial issue. But using the law to address a business practice (no tips) by reporting illegal activity (weed use) could be seen as a misuse of the legal system. \n\nThe customer is clearly choosing not to tip by entering $0.00, not forgetting. The driver makes $5 an hour plus tips, so losing tips is a real problem. But is reporting someone for an illegal activity a justified action here? The driver might be using the weed as a reason to target the customer for not tipping. There's a conflict of interest here: the driver is using a legal issue to address a financial grievance. \n\nAlso, as a delivery driver, are they allowed to report customers for activities they observe? If the driver is a private citizen, they have the right to report crimes they witness, but it's often advised to do so for legitimate safety or legal concerns, not personal vendettas. If the customer is smoking weed in their own home, even if illegal, it's a civil offense unless it's causing harm or disturbance. The driver's primary issue is the lack of tips, which is a business issue, not a legal one. \n\nMoreover, the customer might not be breaking any laws related to the delivery service. The driver's role is to deliver the pizza, not to enforce local laws. Using that position to report customers for personal gain could be seen as unethical. The right to report should be based on actual criminal activity that affects others or public safety, not for unpaid tips. \n\nSo, even though the customer is committing an illegal act, the driver's motivation might be more about the tips than the law. Therefore, the driver could be in the wrong for using a legal issue to address a financial issue. It's possible that the customer is aware that the driver is trying to get them in trouble, which could lead to further conflict. The appropriate action for the driver would be to address the tipping issue through their employer or customer service, not by involving the police for a non-violent, personal activity.\n"
