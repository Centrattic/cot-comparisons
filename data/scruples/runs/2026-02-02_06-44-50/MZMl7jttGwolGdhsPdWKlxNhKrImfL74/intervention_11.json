Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the delivery driver is wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and is smoking weed. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, the customer isn't tipping multiple times. The driver mentions losing money on each delivery because it's a far location. They rely on tips for income. The customer writes $0.00 intentionally, not forgetting. The driver isn't against weed use but sees it as illegal.\n\nSo, the main points are: reporting someone for not tipping vs. their weed use. The driver is upset about lost income and wants to report them. But is it right to report someone for using illegal substances, even if they're not tipping? \n\nThe customer's weed use is a legal issue, but the driver's grievance is about tips. Reporting someone for a personal legal issue might be seen as using police for non-emergencies. Also, the driver might be retaliating over lack of tips. \n\nThe driver's job is to deliver food, not enforce laws. Even if the customer isn't tipping, using police to address that could be overstepping. So, is the driver in the wrong for considering that? \n\nPossibly, because it's not the driver's place to report personal legal matters unless there's a direct harm or crime related to their job. The lack of tips is a business/financial issue, not a criminal one. So the driver might be wrong to report for that reason. \n\nBut maybe the weed use is a separate issue. However, unless the customer is using in a way that affects the driver directly (like being aggressive, etc.), it's not the driver's business. So the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they're using a legal report as retaliation for not getting tips.\n"
