Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a delivery driver who's considering reporting a customer to the police because the customer doesn't tip and is obviously high on weed. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person is a delivery driver for a pizza place. The customer hasn't tipped four times, each time when the driver noticed the customer was stoned and smelled like weed. The customer writes $0.00 in the tip, so it's intentional, not a mistake. The driver loses money on each delivery to this customer, and their pay is $5/hour plus tips, which is crucial for their income.\n\nThe key points here are: the driver wants to report the customer for illegal drug use. But is that the right action? Let me think about the legal and ethical aspects.\n\nLegally, in the US, possession of marijuana is illegal under federal law but may be legal in some states. However, if the customer is smoking weed in their home, that's usually protected under privacy laws. Unless the driver can prove that the customer is using drugs in a public place or in a way that violates specific laws, reporting them might not be justified. Also, the driver is not a law enforcement officer, so they can't just report someone based on suspicion without probable cause.\n\nEthically, the driver is upset about not being tipped, which is a valid concern. But using the excuse of drug use to report someone seems like a stretch. The driver is essentially using the customer's personal choice (even if illegal) as a reason to get even for not receiving tips. That's a form of retaliation, which isn't right. The driver should address the tipping issue directly, maybe by not delivering to that customer anymore or setting boundaries, but reporting for drug use isn't the solution.\n\nAlso, the driver's financial situation is tough, relying on tips. However, the solution isn't to report someone for their personal habits. The driver might need to talk to the employer about the delivery routes or costs, or adjust their approach to tipping. But using the law to target a customer over tips is not appropriate.\n\nSo, putting this all together: the author is not in the right to report someone for drug use as a means of retaliation for not receiving tips. The legal justification is weak, and the ethical approach would be to handle the tipping issue without involving law enforcement. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong in terms of the action they're considering, but the question is whether they are in the wrong. Wait, the user's initial thought was that the author is in the wrong. But according to the analysis, the act of reporting for drug use as a response to non-tipping is wrong. Therefore, the correct answer would be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because their motivation is to get revenge on the tip issue, not to report a crime. Alternatively, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) if the action itself isn't illegal, but morally wrong. Hmm, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the action is illegal, then the answer might differ. But since the customer's drug use is in their home, and the driver is not a witness to an actual crime (unless there's a public use), then the report is unfounded. So the author is acting wrongly by making a false report or a report with malicious intent. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
