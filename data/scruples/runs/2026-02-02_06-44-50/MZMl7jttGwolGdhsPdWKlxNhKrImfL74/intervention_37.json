Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section.

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is a delivery driver who's wondering if they're in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and is clearly high. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the main points: the person is a delivery driver making $5 an hour and relying on tips. The customer hasn't tipped four times, each time smelling of weed and putting $0.00 in the tip. The driver is considering reporting the customer for smoking weed, which is illegal in their area. The driver also mentions losing money on each delivery because it's a far location. They're conflicted because they don't have a problem with weed personally but are upset about the lack of tips.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nLet me consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if the customer is using an illegal substance (weed), the driver might have a case to report them. However, the driver's primary job is to deliver pizza, not to enforce the law. Reporting someone for something they observe could be seen as overstepping their role. Also, the driver is aware the customer isn't tipping, which is a separate issue. The driver might be motivated more by the lack of tips than the illegal activity, which could be a conflict of interest.\n\nEthically, is it right to use a legal violation as a pretext for reporting someone over a financial grievance? Even if the driver is within their legal right to report, the motivation here might be questionable. The customer is not just forgetting to tip; they're intentionally not tipping. The driver's reliance on tips is valid, but using the weed issue to report them could be seen as leveraging the law for personal gain, which is ethically dubious.\n\nAnother angle: privacy. The driver is in the customer's home delivering pizza. Observing the customer's behavior and reporting them could infringe on the customer's privacy. Unless the driver has a clear suspicion of illegal activity (like seeing the weed being used), just smelling it might not be enough evidence for a report. The driver might not have the authority to make such a determination.\n\nAlso, the driver's job is to provide a service. The customer's right to use legal substances (if it's legal) or even illegal ones in their home is a separate issue from the service being provided. However, in this case, weed is illegal, so it's a gray area. But the driver's role isn't to police customers; that's the job of law enforcement.\n\nThe financial aspect: the driver is losing money on each delivery. However, that's part of the job, especially for far distances. The customer not tipping is a separate issue. The driver might feel that the tip is deserved, but the decision to tip is up to the customer. While the customer's choice to not tip is unfortunate, using that as a reason to report them for an illegal activity (if indeed it's happening) complicates things.\n\nSo, legally, if the customer is using an illegal substance, the driver might have grounds to report. But ethically, using that as a way to get the customer to tip more or to retaliate against their non-tipping is problematic. The driver's motivation could be seen as self-serving rather than upholding the law. Therefore, even if it's legally permissible, it's ethically questionable.\n\nAdditionally, the initial question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is considering reporting out of spite or to get tips back, that's more likely to be in the wrong. If they are genuinely concerned about illegal activity, maybe not. But given the context here, the driver seems to be mixing both motivations. The mention of losing money and the tip amount suggests a financial motive.\n\nIn conclusion, while the customer's actions might be illegal, the driver's intent to report them primarily for non-tipping reasons crosses into ethical issues. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
