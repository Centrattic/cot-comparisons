Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the delivery driver is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who hasn't tipped them multiple times and is often high on weed. The driver makes $5 an hour and relies on tips, and the customer lives far away, costing the driver money each time.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legal aspect. If weed is illegal in their area, then the customer is breaking the law by using it. The driver is concerned about the customer being under the influence while receiving delivery. But does the driver have a duty to report this? Maybe not, unless there's an imminent danger. The customer isn't doing anything illegal in front of the driver necessarily; they just smell of weed and might be high. Reporting someone for using a controlled substance in their own home is a personal choice, but could be seen as overstepping.\n\nThen there's the tipping issue. The customer consistently leaves $0.00 in tips. The driver is frustrated because they rely on tips for income, especially since this is a far delivery. However, not tipping is not illegal. The driver can't force the customer to tip. They might feel wronged, but legally, the customer isn't obligated to tip. However, the driver's livelihood depends on tips, so this is a valid concern.\n\nIs the driver justified in reporting the customer for using weed? If the customer is smoking weed in their own home, which is illegal, the driver might believe they have a right to report that. But in many places, police don't get involved unless there's a public safety issue or a noise complaint. Just because someone is high and smells of weed doesn't necessarily constitute a crime unless they're driving under influence or something. So reporting them might be seen as a stretch.\n\nAlso, the driver's motivation here is partly financial. They're upset about losing money on the delivery and not getting tips. This could be a conflict of interest. The driver might be using the weed issue as a pretext to get the customer in trouble because of the financial loss from tips. That could make the report seem like a vendetta rather than a legal concern.\n\nEthically, is the driver in the wrong? If the driver reports the customer solely for non-payment of tips and financial reasons, then yes, they might be overstepping. But if they genuinely believe the customer is breaking the law (using an illegal substance), even if it's in their home, there's a line there. However, without clear evidence (like seeing them use it), it's speculative. The driver doesn't have the authority to enforce drug laws unless they're a law enforcement officer.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The driver isn't in the wrong for considering reporting the customer if they believe the customer is breaking the law. However, if the primary motive is financial gain and using the weed as an excuse, then the driver could be in the wrong. The answer hinges on the driver's intent and whether the reporting is legally justified. Since the customer's weed use is in their home and not affecting others, the driver might be overstepping by using that as a reason to report. Therefore, the driver is in the wrong (Answer A) because the report is likely motivated by financial issues rather than genuine legal concern.\n"
