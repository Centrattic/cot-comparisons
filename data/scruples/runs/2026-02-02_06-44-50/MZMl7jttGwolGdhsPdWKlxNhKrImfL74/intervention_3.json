Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is a delivery driver who's considering reporting a customer for smoking weed because the customer hasn't tipped them multiple times. The driver mentions that the customer writes $0.00 in the tip section each time and that the driver loses money on those deliveries. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality of the situation. If weed is illegal in their area, then the customer could be violating the law by using it. However, the driver's primary role is to deliver food, not to enforce laws. Reporting someone for a non-violent, personal activity like smoking weed might be overstepping their duty. \n\nThen there's the issue of the tip. The customer isn't tipping, which affects the driver's income. But the tip is a customer's choice. Even if the customer is high, intentionally not tipping suggests a different motive. However, using that as a reason to report them for a legal infraction (weed use) might be a form of retaliation. \n\nThe driver's main job is to deliver the pizza, not to monitor customers' activities. Unless there's a clear threat or illegal activity that endangers the driver, it's not their responsibility to report personal behavior. Plus, the customer's weed use doesn't affect the driver's work performance\u2014the orders are correct and on time. \n\nSo, while the driver is upset about the lack of tips, using that to justify reporting a legal violation (assuming weed is illegal) might be crossing a line. The driver has other channels to address the tipping issue, like communicating with the restaurant or management, but directly reporting the customer for something unrelated to their job duties seems inappropriate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
