Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the delivery driver is in the wrong if they report a customer for smoking weed multiple times instead of tipping. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the driver mentions that the customer hasn't tipped four times, and during those deliveries, the customer seemed stoned and smelled like weed. The driver is considering reporting them to the police because they lose money on this delivery and rely on tips. The driver also states that the customer intentionally puts $0.00 in the tip, not forgetting.\n\nThe main issue here is whether reporting someone for a non-violent, legal activity (smoking weed where it's illegal) is justified just because they didn't tip. Even though weed is illegal, using that as a reason to report someone for not tipping seems problematic. The driver's primary grievance is about the lack of tips, which is a separate issue from the customer's personal conduct. \n\nThere's a line between seeking justice for legal violations and using it as a means to retaliate for personal grievances. The customer might not have tipped because they were high, but the driver is using the illegal activity as an excuse to report them. This could be seen as exploiting the situation for personal gain rather than addressing the actual issue of tipping. \n\nAdditionally, the driver's reliance on tips is understandable, but reporting someone for a crime to get a tip is not appropriate. The police might not take the report seriously if they determine it's a retaliation for not tipping. Also, the driver could be considered in the wrong for using a false pretext to report someone, which could have legal consequences for the driver, like being accused of malicious reporting.\n\nSo, the driver's motivation is primarily about the tips, not about the weed use. Therefore, the driver is in the wrong for considering a report based on a separate issue. The answer should be A.\n"
