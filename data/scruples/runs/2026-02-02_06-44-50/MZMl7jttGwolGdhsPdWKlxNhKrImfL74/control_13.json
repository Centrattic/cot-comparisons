Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The person is a delivery driver who hasn't received tips from a customer multiple times, and they suspect the customer is smoking weed. They're considering reporting the customer for drug use. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The author mentions that weed is illegal where they live. So if the customer is using an illegal substance, that's a crime. But the driver is a private individual. Does the driver have a right to report someone for illegal activity they observed? In some places, people can report crimes they witness, but there might be nuances. However, the main issue here is whether the driver's actions are justified.\n\nThen there's the context of the tip. The customer intentionally leaves zero tips, and the driver relies on tips. The driver is losing money on each delivery because it's a far location. So there's a financial motivation here. The question is if the driver is using the customer's drug use as an excuse to report them out of spite over not getting tips.\n\nBut the customer's drug use is illegal. The driver is not inventing this; they're reporting an actual crime. However, the driver might have a conflict of interest here. They might be using the illegal activity as a reason to retaliate for not getting tips. The question is whether that's an appropriate reason to report someone.\n\nIn terms of morality, is it right to report someone for a personal grievance? Even if the action is legal, is it ethical? The author is a private individual, not a law enforcement officer. They might be overstepping if their primary motive is revenge or financial gain rather than upholding the law. \n\nAlso, there's the possibility that the driver is misjudging the situation. The smell of weed could be due to other reasons, or the customer might not be using it, or the driver could be mistaken. Reporting based on a suspicion without concrete evidence might lead to false accusations. \n\nBut the customer does write $0.00 in the tip, which is intentional. The driver is losing money. However, the driver's job is to deliver food, not to enforce laws. The responsibility of enforcing drug laws is on the police, not on delivery drivers. \n\nSo the driver is in a tricky spot. Legally, they can report if they believe a crime is occurring, but ethically, using that as a way to get back at someone for not tipping is questionable. The driver might be in the wrong because their primary motive is to get the tip, and they're using the illegal activity as an excuse. However, if they genuinely believe a crime is being committed, they might not be in the wrong. \n\nBut in most cases, using a personal grievance as a pretext to report someone for a separate, unrelated offense might be considered wrong. The driver is conflating two issues: the customer's right to not tip and the customer's potential illegal activity. The customer isn't required to tip, but if they did something illegal, that's separate. The driver's financial loss shouldn't justify reporting the customer unless there's a genuine public safety concern. \n\nSo the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they're using the illegal activity as a way to retaliate for not getting tips, which is a personal grievance rather than a genuine concern for law enforcement. However, if the reporting is done in good faith, maybe they're not in the wrong. But given the context, the answer is likely A.\n"
