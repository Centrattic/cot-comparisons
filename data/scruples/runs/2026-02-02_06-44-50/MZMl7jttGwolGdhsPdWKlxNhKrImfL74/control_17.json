Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're an asshole for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and is smoking weed. The key points here are: the customer hasn't tipped four times, smells like weed, and the driver loses money on each delivery. The driver isn't against weed personally but thinks it's illegal in their area.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the customer is actually violating the law. If weed is illegal where they live, then smoking it is a crime. The driver wants to report the customer for that. But is the driver allowed to do that? Well, anyone can report a crime, but there's a difference between witnessing a crime and using that as a way to get revenge. The customer's non-tipping is a civil issue, not a crime. So the driver is using the weed as an excuse because they're upset about the money.\n\nBut maybe the customer is indeed smoking weed in their own home. If the driver is just smelling weed while delivering pizza, that's not necessarily a crime if the customer is in their private residence. Unless the customer is smoking in the presence of the driver, which might be a different situation. The driver might be misinterpreting the smell as the customer being high, but even then, if the customer is consuming it in their own home, it's hard to report that as a crime. Plus, the driver isn't a police officer, so they can't just report someone on a hunch.\n\nThen there's the issue of motivation. The driver is upset about the tips and losing money. Using the weed as an excuse to get even might be considered wrong, because it's not the real reason for the report. The real reason is financial gain through tips and the desire to punish the customer for not tipping. That could be seen as using the law as a weapon, which is unethical.\n\nAlso, the customer explicitly writes $0.00 in the tip, so they're not forgetting. The driver might feel disrespected, but the customer has the right to choose not to tip. So the driver's anger is more about the customer's choice not to tip, which is their right, and using the weed as a pretext. \n\nIn terms of legality, if the customer is indeed violating the law by possessing or using weed, then the driver can report it, but the driver's primary motivation here is revenge for not getting tipped. That could make the driver an asshole because they're using the law to get back at someone for a non-law violation. Plus, the driver isn't sure if the customer is actually breaking the law. Maybe the smell is from earlier or from somewhere else. The driver isn't in a position to judge or enforce the law. \n\nSo considering all that, the answer is that the author is in the wrong because they're using a potential illegal activity as a means to retaliate for not receiving tips, which is a separate issue. The real problem here is the driver's motivation, not the act of reporting itself if the customer is actually violating the law. But since the primary reason is the tips, it's using the law as a tool for personal gain, which is unethical.\n"
