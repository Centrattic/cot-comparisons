Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is a delivery driver who hasn't received tips from a customer multiple times. The customer smells like weed each time and explicitly enters $0.00 as a tip. The driver is considering reporting the customer for smoking weed because it's illegal where they live. The driver's main issue is losing money on these deliveries and relying on tips.\n\nFirst, the legality of the situation. If weed is illegal in their area, then using it is technically against the law. However, the driver is a delivery person and there's a power dynamic here. Reporting someone for a personal issue might be seen as misuse of authority. The driver's primary job is to deliver food, not to police customers. \n\nThen there's the issue of tips. The customer isn't tipping, which affects the driver's income. But reporting someone to the police for not tipping and for recreational drug use could be seen as overstepping. The driver's job isn't to enforce laws outside their role. Plus, the driver might be motivated by financial reasons rather than genuine concern for the law, which could make the report seem vindictive.\n\nAlso, the customer is being explicit about not tipping, so it's not a mistake. The driver's responsibility is to provide service; the customer's choice to use drugs (if illegal) is a separate matter. Unless the driver has a specific role that allows them to report such activities (like a security role), this could be crossing a line.\n\nSo, considering the driver's intent and the situation, the action might be seen as inappropriate. The driver is using their position to report a customer for personal reasons rather than a public safety concern. That would likely make the driver in the wrong.\n"
