He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting a trans sales rep at their dad's dealership because customers are leaving. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In the US, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits employment discrimination based on gender identity. So firing or moving an employee because they're trans could be illegal. The author is considering moving Anna to another job, which could be a form of discrimination.\n\nThen there's the business ethics angle. The author mentions that the dealership is in a conservative state, and customers are leaving because they're transphobic. The author is prioritizing business over potentially discriminatory practices. But is it right to accommodate bigoted customers by moving a trans employee? That's a tough one. On one hand, the business needs to make money, but on the other, they shouldn't enable discrimination.\n\nThe author claims they have no issue with trans people and respect them. However, the action of moving Anna based on customer reactions could still be discriminatory. The problem isn't Anna's performance but her identity. Even if the business is losing money, that's not a valid reason to discriminate. Plus, there might be other solutions, like training sales staff to handle customer concerns or finding other ways to attract customers who are accepting.\n\nThe manager, Amy, called the author transphobic, which suggests she sees the action as discriminatory. The author's justification is business-related, but the law and ethics might side with Anna. So, even if the author's intention isn't malicious, the act of moving Anna based on her gender identity could be considered wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together: legally, it's likely against the law. Ethically, it's enabling discrimination. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
