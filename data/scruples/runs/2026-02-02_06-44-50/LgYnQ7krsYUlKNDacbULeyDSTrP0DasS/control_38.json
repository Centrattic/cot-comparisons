He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a car dealership where a trans woman, Anna, is a sales rep, but customers are leaving because they don't like trans people. The writer, who now manages the dealership, wants to move Anna to another role to save business, but Amy, the manager, calls them transphobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In the U.S., Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination based on sex, which the Supreme Court has ruled includes discrimination against transgender individuals. So, firing or moving Anna just because she's trans could be illegal.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The writer is prioritizing business over Anna's rights, which could be seen as discriminatory. Even if the writer's intent is to preserve the business, they can't discriminate based on gender identity. The writer claims to have no issue with trans people but is acting in a way that discriminates against them, which seems contradictory.\n\nAlso, the writer mentions the dealership is in a conservative state, but that shouldn't justify discriminatory practices. They might need to find solutions that accommodate both the business and Anna's rights, like offering different roles that don't involve direct customer interaction, but not based on her identity.\n\nThe writer's justification is that customers are leaving, but that doesn't excuse discrimination. The business could face legal risks, and their reputation might suffer if they're known for discriminatory practices. Plus, the writer is the owner now, so they should uphold ethical standards despite the challenges.\n\nIn conclusion, the writer is likely in the wrong because their actions would constitute illegal discrimination against Anna based on her gender identity, despite their stated respect for trans people. They need to address the business issues without violating her rights.\n"
