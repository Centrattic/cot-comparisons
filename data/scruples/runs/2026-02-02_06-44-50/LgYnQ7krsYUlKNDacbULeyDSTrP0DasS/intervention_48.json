He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting a trans girl as a sales rep because customers are leaving. The author's main points are that they don't have anything against trans people, but in a conservative area, customers are uncomfortable with Anna, leading to lost profits. They suggested moving her to another role.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, including the US, it's illegal to discriminate based on gender identity. Even if the author's reasoning is about customer preferences, changing Anna's role because of their trans identity could be seen as discrimination. The EEOC (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) protects against such discrimination, so the author's suggestion might violate those laws.\n\nNext, the ethical angle. The author claims they respect trans people, but their action is based on catering to prejudiced customers. That creates a conflict. While business decisions are often about profit, treating employees based on stereotypes or customer biases can be ethically questionable. It sends a message that the business supports discrimination, which could harm the brand's reputation in the long run.\n\nAlso, the author's justification is that Amy hired Anna for her skills. If Anna is performing well, moving her just because of customers' prejudices undermines the hiring decision. The author is prioritizing financial loss from some customers over losing others who might value inclusivity. However, the author might argue that the immediate financial impact is a practical concern, but that's a slippery slope where any minority could be discriminated against for similar reasons.\n\nAnother point: the author's father wanted the dealership to continue, so maintaining the business's integrity and values might be part of honoring that wish. If the father had values of inclusion, the author's decision might go against that. But the user doesn't mention the father's values, so it's speculative.\n\nIn terms of business practices, maybe there are alternative solutions. Training staff to handle customer concerns, marketing the dealership as inclusive (which could attract a different customer base), or addressing customer discomfort through other means. The author didn't mention exploring these options, only moving Anna.\n\nLegally and ethically, the author is likely in the wrong. Even if the intention is to protect profits, the action is discriminatory. The EEOC guidelines would protect Anna from being moved solely based on her gender identity. The author's reasoning that customers are leaving is a form of adverse impact due to bias, which doesn't justify discrimination.\n"
