He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting a trans girl as a sales rep because customers are leaving. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the author's situation: they inherited their dad's dealership, hired a manager, and there's a trans sales rep named Anna. The problem is that customers are leaving because they're transphobic, leading to lost profits. The author suggests moving Anna to another role, but Amy calls them transphobic.\n\nSo, the core issue is discrimination. The author is facing a business decision where they want to keep customers but are accused of being transphobic. But wait, is the author actually being discriminatory, or are they responding to customers' prejudices?\n\nLegally, under anti-discrimination laws like Title VII in the US, employers can't discriminate based on gender identity. So if the author is considering firing or moving Anna because of her being trans, that's illegal. But the author's reasoning is that customers are leaving due to her being trans. However, the law protects employees from discrimination based on their identity, not just customers' reactions. The business can't claim a religious or customer preference defense here. \n\nAlso, the author claims they have no issue with trans people, but the action is still based on Anna's gender identity, which is the problem. Even if the author's intention is to save the business, acting on customer biases could be seen as perpetuating discrimination. The author should address the customers' biases, maybe through training or other means, rather than accommodating the bias by changing the employee's role. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because their action, even if not malicious, is discriminatory. The correct legal and ethical stance is to protect employees from such discrimination, regardless of customer reactions.\n"
