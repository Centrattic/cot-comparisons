He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The author, who is the heir to a car dealership, is facing a dilemma where a trans sales rep, Anna, is being criticized for driving away customers in a conservative area. The author wants to move her to another role to protect the business's profits, but Amy, the manager, called them transphobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In the U.S., Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as interpreted by the Supreme Court in Bostock v. Clayton County (2020), prohibits employment discrimination based on sex, which includes discrimination against transgender individuals. So, if the author is considering moving Anna because of her gender identity, that could be a violation of anti-discrimination laws.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The author claims they have no issue with trans people and respect them, but the business decision is based on customer reactions. However, if customers are leaving because of transphobia, the business might be catering to discriminatory behavior, which some might argue is ethically problematic. The author's stance is that this is a business decision, but others might see it as discriminatory against trans employees.\n\nFrom a business standpoint, the author is trying to maximize profits, which is a legitimate concern. However, by moving Anna, they might be prioritizing customer (possibly transphobic) preferences over employee rights. There's also an argument that by not accommodating Anna, the business could face legal action or reputational damage if it's seen as discriminatory.\n\nAnother angle is the manager's reaction. Amy, who hired Anna, sees the author's suggestion as transphobic. The author's justification relies on the idea that customers are the problem, not Anna. But legally and ethically, the onus is on the business to address customer discrimination rather than penalizing the employee. The business could provide training to employees to handle such situations or enforce a non-discrimination policy that protects both employees and customers.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the dealership is in a conservative state, which might exacerbate the issue. However, businesses are expected to comply with federal laws regardless of local opinions. Moving Anna could set a precedent that might affect other employees' morale and the dealership's reputation.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intention might be to save the business, the action of moving Anna due to her gender identity could be legally and ethically questionable. The business should address customer discrimination through policy and training rather than compromising on non-discrimination principles. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
