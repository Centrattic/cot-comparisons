He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting a trans girl as a sales rep because customers are leaving. They mentioned that the dealership is in a conservative state and that profits have dropped because of this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In the US, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits employment discrimination based on gender identity. So firing or moving an employee because they are trans could be illegal. The person is suggesting moving Anna to another role, but the reason is her being trans, which might still be discriminatory.\n\nThen, there's the ethical angle. The person claims they aren't transphobic but are making a business decision. However, choosing to discriminate based on a protected class, even if it's for business reasons, is generally frowned upon. The argument that customers are leaving due to her being trans is a business loss, but that doesn't necessarily justify discrimination. Businesses can't prioritize profits over legal and ethical standards.\n\nThe person also mentions that the trans employee is competent. Moving her for reasons unrelated to performance could be seen as prejudiced. The manager (Amy) called them transphobic, which makes sense because the action is based on the employee's gender identity, not her job performance.\n\nSo, even though the person might not have ill intentions, their decision is based on a discriminatory reason, which is against the law and ethical guidelines. Therefore, they are in the wrong.\n"
