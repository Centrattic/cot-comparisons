He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author hiring a trans sales rep, Anna, who is effective but causing customers to leave because of their transphobia. The author wants to move her to another job to save the business. Amy, the manager, called the author transphobic, but the author argues it's a business decision.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, including the US, it's illegal to discriminate against employees based on gender identity. The Civil Rights Act and some state laws protect against workplace discrimination. If moving Anna from her sales position is based on her gender identity rather than her performance, that could be discriminatory. The author's reasoning is that customers are leaving because of her trans identity, leading to lost profits. However, the business can't use customer preferences as a justification for discrimination if it's illegal. \n\nNext, ethical considerations. The author claims to respect trans people, but the action of moving Anna could still be seen as transphobic if it's based on the assumption that customers can't handle working with trans employees. The author is prioritizing profit over inclusivity, which might be ethically problematic. However, the author's intention isn't to harm Anna but to protect the business. \n\nBut from a legal and ethical standpoint, businesses can't cater to discriminatory customer preferences. For example, restaurants can't refuse service to certain groups even if some customers are uncomfortable. Similarly, the dealership can't move an employee to avoid customer bias if that's not based on performance. \n\nThe author might argue that it's about business sustainability, but the law doesn't allow using such reasons to discriminate. Also, the author could explore other solutions like training employees to handle customer concerns or changing the dealership's marketing to attract a more inclusive customer base. \n\nSo, the answer would depend on the legal context and whether the business's action is a form of discrimination. Since the user mentioned the state is conservative, there might be laws in place that protect against this. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because the decision is based on the employee's gender identity leading to discrimination, which is illegal and unethical.\n"
