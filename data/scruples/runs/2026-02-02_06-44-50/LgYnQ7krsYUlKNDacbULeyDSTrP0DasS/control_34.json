He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting a trans girl as a sales rep because customers are leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the legal aspects. In the US, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits employment discrimination based on sex, gender identity, and sexual orientation. So firing someone for being trans is illegal. The author is considering moving Anna to another position, but the core issue is whether they can discriminate against her because of her gender identity, even if it's affecting business.\n\nThe author mentions that the dealership is in a conservative state. However, laws don't change based on location when it comes to federal protections. Even if the customers are uncomfortable, that's their problem, not Anna's. The business can't discriminate based on the customer's preferences.\n\nAlso, the author says they respect trans people but are acting out of concern for business. However, the decision to adjust the job role might be a workaround to avoid direct discrimination. But if the move is based solely on gender identity, it's still discriminatory. The EEOC has stated that discrimination based on gender identity is a form of sex discrimination.\n\nAnother angle is the business justification. The author claims profits have dropped because of this. But they need to prove that Anna's gender identity is the direct cause of the loss. Maybe there are other factors affecting sales. Plus, if they can offer another role within the dealership that doesn't involve customer interaction, that's a valid accommodation. However, if the only reason to move her is because of her gender identity, that's illegal.\n\nThe manager called the author transphobic, which the author denies. The key here is intent versus impact. Even if the author doesn't have ill intentions, the action is discriminatory. The law is about the impact on the employee, not the employer's intent.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because their decision is based on discrimination against a protected class, which is illegal. The business can't prioritize customer comfort over legal obligations.\n"
