He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting a trans girl as a sales rep because customers are leaving, causing a drop in profits.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: In the US, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits employment discrimination based on sex, which includes gender identity. So firing Anna because she's trans would be illegal. The author is advocating moving her to another role, but that might still be problematic if it's because of her gender identity.\n\nEthically, it's a tough spot. The author claims they have no personal issue with trans people and respect them. The main concern is business loss due to customer biases in a conservative area. However, the business is losing customers because of others' prejudice, not Anna's performance. The author is making a business decision based on that, but is that justifiable?\n\nFrom a business perspective, maybe they're trying to protect profits. But discrimination in hiring or assigning roles based on gender identity is illegal. The author isn't directly firing her, just suggesting a role change. However, the intent is to avoid discrimination by customers, which could still be seen as discriminatory. The EEOC would likely view this as a form of discrimination, as it's based on gender identity and leads to segregation of roles.\n\nAlso, the author's sister is mentioned but not involved in the decision. The father's wishes are to run the dealership, so the author is trying to honor that while managing it remotely. But the core issue is whether the decision to move Anna is discriminatory. Even if the intention is business, the law doesn't allow discriminatory practices, regardless of the reason.\n\nSo, the author's actions, though well-intentioned to save the business, may still be in the wrong legally and ethically because they're enforcing a policy that discriminates against a trans employee to accommodate the prejudices of customers. The correct approach would be to address customer bias without compromising the rights of employees.\n"
