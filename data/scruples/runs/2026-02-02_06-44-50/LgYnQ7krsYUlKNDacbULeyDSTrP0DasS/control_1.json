He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting a trans girl as a sales rep because customers are leaving. The situation is that the dealership is in a conservative state, and the trans sales rep, Anna, is causing customers to leave, leading to profit loss. The author argued it's a business decision, not personal dislike.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, including the US, employment discrimination based on gender identity is illegal. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) protects against discrimination under Title VII. So, if the author is considering moving Anna because she's trans, that could be illegal. The business can't discriminate based on gender identity.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The author claims they're not transphobic but making a business decision. However, the issue is that the business is choosing to exclude a trans employee to accommodate the biases of customers. That could be seen as discriminatory towards the employee. The business should aim to serve all customers, but not at the expense of employees' rights. Maybe there are other solutions, like providing training to customers or adjusting marketing strategies to attract a different clientele.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is that customers are leaving because Anna is trans, but that's a form of discrimination. The business can't justify discriminatory practices because of customer biases. It's like saying, \"We can't hire a Black salesperson because some customers are racist.\" The business has a responsibility to not engage in that kind of discrimination.\n\nAnother point is that the author is not the one hiring Anna; Amy, the manager, did. The author is now interfering based on customer preferences. This could be seen as undermining the manager's decision and creating a hostile work environment for Anna if she's moved because of customer discomfort.\n\nPossible alternatives the author didn't consider: improving customer service training, addressing customer concerns without firing or reassigning Anna, or even addressing the root cause of why customers are leaving. Maybe the business could focus on attracting a more diverse customer base that's more accepting.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because their decision is based on discriminatory reasons, which is illegal and unethical. They are prioritizing the biases of a subset of customers over the rights of an employee, which is not acceptable.\n"
