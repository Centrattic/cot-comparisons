He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting a trans girl as a sales rep because customers are leaving. The author's reasoning is that even though they have no issue with trans people, the business is losing money due to customers' reactions in a conservative area.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In the U.S., Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits employment discrimination based on gender identity. So, firing or moving someone for being trans is illegal. The author is suggesting moving Anna to another role, which might be a form of discrimination. Even if it's framed as a business decision, the intent might still be discriminatory.\n\nNext, ethical considerations. The author claims they have no issue with trans people and that they respect them. However, the action of moving Anna is based on the customers' transphobia, not the author's. But legally, the business can't discriminate based on gender identity, even if it's to avoid losing customers. Plus, there's a business risk in taking such actions\u2014could lead to legal trouble or backlash.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that Amy called them transphobic. While the author might not have malicious intent, the consequence of their decision is discriminatory. The business could face legal action if they terminate or reassign Anna because of her gender identity. Even if they're not directly hostile, the policy is discriminatory.\n\nAnother angle: the author is the owner now, so they have the authority to make decisions. But they need to balance between business interests and legal/ethical obligations. Maybe there's a way to handle this without discrimination, like training staff to address customer concerns or marketing in a way that attracts a broader audience. However, the author's solution is to hide Anna, which is problematic.\n\nSo, from both legal and ethical perspectives, the author is in the wrong. They are making a decision that discriminates against a trans employee based on customers' biases, which is not acceptable under the law and violates principles of equality.\n"
