He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting a trans girl as a sales rep because customers are leaving, leading to a loss in profits. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In the US, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as interpreted by the Supreme Court in 2020, protects employees from discrimination based on gender identity. So, firing or demoting someone because they are transgender is illegal. The author is suggesting moving Anna from a sales rep role to another job, which could be seen as discriminatory if the reason is her gender identity.\n\nThen, there's the ethical angle. The author claims they have no issue with trans people and respects them, but the decision is based on customers' reactions. Even if the author's intention is to save the business, they are acting on discriminatory behavior from customers rather than the employee's performance. The EEOC has guidelines that employers shouldn't make decisions based on the biases of others. So, firing or reassigning Anna because some customers are uncomfortable is not permissible.\n\nFrom a business standpoint, the author is trying to mitigate losses, but there might be other solutions. Maybe training sales reps to handle such situations, or improving the dealership's image to attract a more diverse customer base. Also, if Anna is a good sales rep, losing her could hurt the business in other ways, like her skills and contributions.\n\nThe author also mentions that Amy called them transphobic. Even if the author didn't mean to discriminate, the action still targets Anna based on her identity. The key here is whether the decision is based on legitimate business reasons. If there's no evidence that Anna's performance is lacking, the only reason is her being trans, which is protected.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because their decision is based on discrimination against a protected class, even if the motivation is to save profits. There are legal protections in place, and ethical considerations about not accommodating customers' prejudices by discriminating against employees.\n"
