He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting a trans sales rep causing customers to leave. The situation involves a car dealership in a conservative area where some customers are uncomfortable with a trans salesperson, leading to lost profits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, including the U.S., employment discrimination based on gender identity is illegal. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) covers transgender individuals under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. So, the author's suggestion to move Anna from her sales role might be a form of discrimination, even if their intention is business-related.\n\nNext, the ethical angle. The author claims they respect trans people but is making a business decision based on customer prejudice. This could be seen as complicit in allowing transphobia to affect employment decisions. They're prioritizing profit over fair treatment, which might be ethically questionable.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that customers are leaving because they don't respect Anna, leading to financial loss. However, this assumes that the only way to retain customers is to hide or remove trans employees, which perpetuates discrimination. There's also the argument about the manager Amy hiring Anna for her skills, so the problem isn't her qualifications but the customers' biases.\n\nAnother point is the author's own admission of not wanting to run the dealership and relying on a manager. Now they're second-guessing the manager's hiring decision. This might reflect a lack of commitment to supporting their team's decisions, especially when based on merit.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. I should consider whether the author's actions, though well-intentioned from a business standpoint, still violate legal and ethical standards. Even if the intention is to save the business, the method of addressing the issue is problematic.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally and ethically, the author is likely in the wrong for suggesting moving Anna based on her gender identity, despite the business impact. The correct approach would involve addressing customer bias through education or other means rather than discriminating against employees.\n"
