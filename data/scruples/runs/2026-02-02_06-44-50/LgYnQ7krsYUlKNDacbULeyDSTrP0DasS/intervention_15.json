He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting a trans girl as a sales rep because customers are leaving. The author claims they have no issues with trans people, but business profits are dropping because customers discriminate. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, including the US, discrimination based on gender identity is prohibited under civil rights laws. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) considers gender identity a protected class. So, if the author is asking to move Anna because of her trans identity, that could be illegal. Even if the reason is business loss due to customer discrimination, the law protects employees from being treated differently based on their gender identity. The business can't legally make decisions that discriminate against employees.\n\nThen, there's the ethical angle. The author is prioritizing customer comfort over an employee's rights. Even if the customers are acting on prejudice, the business has a responsibility to not enable that discrimination. Moving Anna to a non-customer-facing role would be discriminatory. The problem here is the customers' intolerance, not Anna's identity. The business should address the customer side, maybe through training or policies that promote inclusivity, rather than accommodating the bias against Anna.\n\nThe author's argument is that they don't want to ruin their dad's dealership. However, the solution should not involve discrimination. They could explore other ways to retain customers without compromising their values. For example, educating customers or shifting marketing strategies. Also, the author mentions Anna is a good sales rep, so removing her from that role might hurt the business more in the long run, as she's effective at her job.\n\nAnother point is the author's own attitude. They say they have no issue with trans people, but their actions still lead to discrimination. This hypocrisy might make them in the wrong. The fact that they're blaming the customer's reaction rather than taking responsibility for maintaining an inclusive workplace shows a lack of accountability.\n\nBut wait, the author is trying to save the business. Is there a way to balance both? Maybe, but the law is clear. The business can't legally discriminate. So even if the intention is to save profits, the method is illegal and unethical. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
