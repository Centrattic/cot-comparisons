He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not wanting a trans girl as a sales rep because customers are leaving, causing a drop in profits.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the legal aspects. In the U.S., Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination based on sex, which includes transgender individuals. So, firing or moving someone because they are trans could be illegal. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has stated that discrimination based on gender identity is a form of sex discrimination. So, if the author is suggesting moving Anna due to her being trans, that might be illegal.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The author claims they have no issue with trans people personally but is making a business decision based on customers' reactions. However, allowing customers' prejudice to affect employment decisions might be ethically wrong. It's like saying, \"We can't hire someone because others might discriminate against them,\" which could be seen as discriminatory.\n\nThe author argues that profits are dropping, but they need to consider if there are other solutions. Maybe training staff to handle customer reactions, marketing to a more accepting demographic, or providing customer education. Also, maybe there's a way to retain Anna's skills without having her as a sales rep, like a backend role, but the author is suggesting moving her for a different role, which might not be allowed if it's a demotion or based on her gender identity.\n\nAmy called the author transphobic, which makes sense if the author is targeting Anna specifically for being trans. Even if the author's intention is to save the business, the action could still be discriminatory. The EEOC would likely side with Anna here because discrimination based on gender identity is prohibited.\n\nAlso, the author's situation is a bit complex. They inherited the business and are trying to manage it, but their decision affects an employee's job. The fact that Amy hired Anna and the author is now challenging that decision adds another layer. The author might need to address the underlying issue of customer bias rather than the employee's identity.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong both legally and ethically by suggesting moving Anna due to her being trans, despite the business impact. They should consider alternative solutions that don't discriminate against her.\n"
