He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting a trans girl as a sales rep because customers are leaving. \n\nFirst, the situation: the author's father passed away, and they're now managing the car dealership. They hired a manager, Amy, and there's a trans sales rep named Anna. The problem is that some customers are leaving when they see Anna, leading to a drop in profits. The author suggested moving Anna to another role to save the business, but Amy accused them of being transphobic.\n\nSo, the key points here are about discrimination and business decisions. The author claims they don't have a problem with trans people and even acknowledge that Anna is good at her job. However, they're making a business decision based on the premise that some customers are uncomfortable with her presence. \n\nBut wait, in many places, including the US, it's illegal to discriminate against employees based on their gender identity. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 has been interpreted by the Supreme Court to protect employees from discrimination based on sex, which includes gender identity. So, even if the author's intent is to accommodate customers who are uncomfortable, changing Anna's role because she's trans could be considered discriminatory.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they're trying to save the business by keeping customers. However, the law protects employees from being treated unfairly because of their gender identity. The business might need to find other solutions, like training employees to handle customer concerns without discrimination or finding alternative ways to retain customers without firing or demoting an employee based on protected characteristics.\n\nAlso, the author's claim that they're \"not transphobic\" and that they respect trans people doesn't necessarily absolve them of legal or ethical responsibility. The action itself is what matters here. Even if well-intentioned, making a business decision that targets a protected class based on stereotypes or assumptions is problematic.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's decision to suggest moving Anna due to her gender identity could be seen as discriminatory, regardless of their personal feelings towards trans people. Therefore, the answer is that the author is in the wrong.\n"
