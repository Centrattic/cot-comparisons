He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a car dealership owner who doesn't want a trans sales rep because customers are leaving, leading to decreased profits. The author says they have no issue with trans people but are concerned about business losses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In the US, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. However, there have been recent Supreme Court rulings, like Bostock v. Clayton County, which extended protections under Title VII to include gender identity and sexual orientation. So, firing or moving a trans employee based on their identity could be illegal. But the author isn't saying to fire Anna; they want to move her to another position. But moving her might still be discrimination if it's based on her gender identity.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The author claims they respect trans people but are making a business decision. However, choosing to segregate an employee because some customers might be uncomfortable is a form of transphobia. It's also treating Anna differently based on her identity, which could be seen as discriminatory. Plus, the author is allowing customer bigotry to influence business decisions, which might be harmful.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the dealership is losing customers and profits. But they should consider alternatives, like training staff to handle customer complaints without discrimination, or educating customers, rather than accommodating the bigots. Also, the author mentions that Amy (the manager) hired Anna, so maybe there's a conflict there. Amy called the author transphobic, which the author disputes, but they should reflect on whether their actions are indeed discriminatory.\n\nAnother point: the author is in a position of power and is using their influence to exclude someone else because of their identity, even if it's not direct discrimination. This could be seen as wrong because they are prioritizing their own business interests over the employee's rights and the potential for other solutions.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention might be to save the business, the method they're using could be legally and ethically questionable. They might be in the wrong for discriminating based on gender identity, even if unintentionally.\n"
