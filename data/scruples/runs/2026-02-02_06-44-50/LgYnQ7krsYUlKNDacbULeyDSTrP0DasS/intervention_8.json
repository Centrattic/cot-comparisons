He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting a trans girl as a sales rep because customers are leaving. The situation involves a car dealership in a conservative state, and the author is the heir apparent after their father's death.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, including the U.S., it's illegal to discriminate against employees based on gender identity. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and various state laws protect against discrimination. So if the author is suggesting moving Anna because she's trans, that could be seen as discriminatory, regardless of the business impact. Even if customers are leaving, the business can't fire or reassign someone based on their gender identity.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The author claims to have no issue with trans people but is making a decision based on potential customer reactions. That seems contradictory. The author is prioritizing business profits over the employee's rights, which might be seen as unethical, even if they have good intentions.\n\nAnna was hired by the manager, Amy, for valid reasons (confident, etc.), so moving her might undermine management's decisions. The author is taking a paternalistic approach, overriding Amy's choice and potentially creating a hostile work environment for Anna.\n\nHowever, the author's intent is to save the business, which is understandable. But legally, the business can't make accommodations for customer discomfort if it's based on discrimination. There might be alternative solutions, like training staff to handle customer concerns or marketing to a more accepting audience.\n\nIn conclusion, even if the author's intention is to save the business, the action of reassigning Anna based on her being trans is discriminatory. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
