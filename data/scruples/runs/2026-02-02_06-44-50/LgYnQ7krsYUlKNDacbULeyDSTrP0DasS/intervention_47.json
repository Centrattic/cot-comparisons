He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting a trans girl as a sales rep because customers are leaving and profits are down.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In the US, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination based on sex, which the Supreme Court has interpreted to include discrimination based on gender identity. So firing someone for being transgender is illegal. The author is suggesting moving Anna to another role, but even that could be seen as discriminatory if it's based on her gender identity. Even if it's not a firing, reassigning her because she's trans might still be a form of discrimination. \n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author claims to have no issue with trans people but is making a business decision that leads to marginalizing an employee. The argument is that customers are leaving because they don't respect her, but the author is choosing to prioritize customer comfort over an employee's rights. This could be seen as transphobic because it's allowing prejudice to affect business decisions. \n\nThe author might argue that they're making a tough business choice, but the problem is that they're allowing customers' biases to dictate company policy. Businesses are expected to serve all customers, but they also have to comply with anti-discrimination laws in employment. Also, there's a responsibility to not let customer prejudice affect how employees are treated. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the dealership is in a conservative area, but that doesn't mean they can discriminate. The author might need to find a solution that doesn't involve targeting Anna. Perhaps training staff to handle customer reactions, or improving other aspects to retain customers without sacrificing employee rights. \n\nSo, even if the author's intention isn't to be transphobic, the action of reassigning Anna due to her gender identity is discriminatory and likely illegal. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
