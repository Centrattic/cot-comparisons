      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after rejecting a girl for being overweight. The author says they were straightforward but not nice, using the word \"too big.\" The girl responded angrily. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Being rude or blunt about body size is often seen as insensitive. Weight can be a sensitive topic, and using \"too big\" might come off as dismissive or derogatory. Even if someone has preferences, how they express them matters. The author could have been kinder, like saying they don't see a connection but not due to weight, to avoid hurting feelings.\n\nAlso, the girl's reaction was strong, which might be because the comment hit a sensitive spot. The author's justification is about being transparent, but there's a way to be honest without being cruel. Society is moving towards being more inclusive and respectful, so preferences based on weight can be seen as judgmental. Plus, the author's \"friend\" set up the situation, which might add layers of responsibility in handling the rejection.\n\nOn the flip side, the author isn't forced to date anyone and has the right to their preferences. But the way it was communicated is key. The answer here hinges on whether the response was unnecessarily hurtful. Since the author admits they could have been nicer, it shows they recognize the issue. However, the main point is whether being direct excused the rudeness. Most people would argue that kindness is necessary even when stating preferences. So the author is in the wrong for not being considerate in their delivery.\n"
