I told her \"Sorry but this isn't going to happen\" and when she asked me why I said, only this, that she is \"Too big for for me.\" She proceeded to say Fuck you and I hope you die. I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning. I am allowed to have a preference of non-fat people and if they ask why me, I believe it is justified that I don't sugarcoat shit and give them my truth.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is wrong for turning down a girl because she's overweight.\n\nFirst, the person says they told the girl she's \"too big\" and she reacted angrily. The author admits they could have been nicer but thinks being honest is right. The question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Well, making someone feel bad about their body is usually a no-no. Weight is a sensitive topic, and just saying someone is \"too big\" without any context or kindness can be hurtful. Even if it's a personal preference, the way it's communicated matters. The author did say they could have been nicer, which shows some awareness, but the directness here might not be the best approach. Also, the girl's reaction of saying \"fuck you and I hope you die\" is pretty intense, but that doesn't mean the author is right. Their response might have caused unnecessary harm. So, maybe the answer is A (they are in the wrong) because being respectful and compassionate is important, even when declining someone.\n"
