      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the Ask Advice post is in the wrong. The scenario is about turning down a girl because she's overweight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author rejected someone based on her weight, which is a personal preference. But is that acceptable? People have different preferences, but when it comes to treating others with respect, maybe there's a line. The way he phrased it was \"too big for me,\" which is blunt and could be hurtful. \n\nThe girl reacted angrily, saying \"Fuck you and I hope you die,\" which is definitely not okay. But the author's response was to wish her happiness. He admits he could have been nicer but thinks being truthful is the right approach. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, everyone has the right to their preferences. On the other, being upfront with such a direct and potentially offensive comment might be considered rude. Society often discourages weight-based discrimination, so even if it's a preference, calling someone \"too big\" can be seen as insensitive. \n\nAlso, the fact that the girl was a \"huge\" 325 lbs might make some people think the author's comment was unkind, especially since body image issues are sensitive. While he didn't use derogatory terms, the comment still focuses on her weight as the reason for rejection, which can perpetuate negative stereotypes. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people often advise being kind and not hurting others' feelings unnecessarily. The author's justification is about honesty, but maybe there's a way to be honest without being hurtful. For example, saying he's not interested without specifying weight would avoid making it personal. \n\nHowever, the author's response wasn't the worst possible; he didn't mock her but stated his preference. Still, the core issue is whether the reason for rejection justifies the blunt approach. In many cases, people are advised to avoid giving reasons that could be deemed discriminatory, even if they're personal preferences. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because his reason for rejection is based on a factor that's often considered a sensitive and potentially discriminatory trait, and he delivered it without sufficient tact to avoid hurting her feelings. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
