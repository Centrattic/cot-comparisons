I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for turning down a girl because she was fat. The situation involves the author being blunt about their preference for non-fat people. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms and ethical standards here. The author was honest about their preference, but the way they communicated it might be an issue. Using the word \"too big\" could be seen as focusing on the person's weight in a negative light. Weight is a sensitive topic, and comments about it can be hurtful.\n\nThen there's the aspect of respect. Even if someone has a preference, how they express it matters. The author admitted they could have been nicer, which suggests they recognize the potential for their words to be harsh. The other person's reaction was strong, but that doesn't justify the initial comment. However, the author's intention was to be transparent, which is a valid perspective. \n\nLaws and policies might not directly apply here unless there's discrimination, but since it's a personal choice in a dating context, legal aspects are probably not relevant. The key is whether the author's actions were respectful. While it's their right to have preferences, expressing it in a way that's dismissive or focuses on the person's size could be seen as rude. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for having a preference, but the manner in which they communicated it could be considered hurtful. The answer might depend on cultural or individual perspectives on weight and honesty in rejection. However, generally, being honest but kind is advised. Since the author didn't sugarcoat it, but also didn't use language that's outright derogatory, it's a bit of a gray area. However, considering the impact on the other person's feelings, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong for not being more considerate.\n"
