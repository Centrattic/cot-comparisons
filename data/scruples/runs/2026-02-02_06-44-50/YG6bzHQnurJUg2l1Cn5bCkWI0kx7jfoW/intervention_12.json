I told her \"Sorry but this isn't going to happen\" and when she asked me why I said, only this, that she is \"Too big for for me.\" She proceeded to say Fuck you and I hope you die. I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning. I am allowed to have a preference of non-fat people and if they ask why me, I believe it is justified that I don't sugarcoat shit and give them my truth.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for turning down a girl because she was fat. The author says they told the girl \"too big for me\" and she responded angrily. They acknowledge they could have been nicer but think being honest about their preference is justified.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and values. Weight is a personal preference, but using it directly as a reason for rejection might be seen as insensitive. The author's response was pretty direct, which the girl didn't take well. Even though the author says they're allowed to have preferences, how you communicate that matters. Being honest is one thing, but being blunt without empathy can be hurtful.\n\nAlso, the term \"fat\" can be sensitive. While some people might use it in a neutral way, in this context, it's used as a reason for rejection, which could come off as derogatory. The author's approach might have been more respectful if they focused on personal preferences without making the size the main factor. Maybe they could have said they prefer someone who's more active or has a different lifestyle, which could imply body type indirectly but more respectfully.\n\nAnother angle is the right to personal preferences versus the impact on others. The author believes in being truthful, but the girl's reaction shows that the truth was delivered in a way that was very hurtful. Society often values kindness in rejections, even if the reason is personal. The author's justification might not take into account the emotional impact on the woman.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's approach was direct but not kind. They might be in the wrong not for having the preference itself, but for the way they communicated it. Being honest is good, but being cruel isn't. The answer might be A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
