      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for turning down the girl because she was fat. Let's start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe user is asking if it's acceptable to reject someone based on their size. The author says they were direct and told the girl she was \"too big for me.\" The girl responded angrily. The author justifies it by saying they have a preference for non-fat people and believe they should be honest about their reasons.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical aspects. Weight is a personal characteristic, and while it's a personal preference, making it the sole reason for rejection might be seen as discriminatory. But is that discrimination in this context? In dating, people often have preferences based on various traits, and it's generally acceptable unless it's part of a protected class under anti-discrimination laws. However, in social contexts, being fat-shamed is often looked down upon.\n\nThe author did say they could have been nicer, but they chose to be honest. The response from the girl was hostile, but that's her reaction, not necessarily the author's fault. However, using a direct comment about someone's weight could be hurtful and potentially contribute to body image issues. There's a difference between having a preference and being cruel. The author might have been honest, but the way they phrased it could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nAlso, societal views on body size are changing, and many advocate for body positivity. So, even if it's a personal preference, calling someone \"too big\" in a blunt manner might be seen as offensive. The author's reasoning might be valid for them, but the delivery and the reason itself could be problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't obligated to date someone they aren't interested in. They have the right to their preferences. But the question is whether they're in the wrong for expressing that preference in that way. If the answer is about whether it's acceptable to be honest about preferences, then maybe they're not wrong. But if the focus is on whether it's respectful to mention weight as the reason, then they could be wrong.\n\nI think the key here is the impact of the words. Even if it's a personal preference, the way it was communicated might have been hurtful. The author's justification is that they have the right to their preference, but in a broader social context, fat-shaming is discouraged. So, even if the author isn't legally wrong, socially they might be in the wrong. The answer might depend on societal norms versus personal rights.\n"
