I told her \"Sorry but this isn't going to happen\" and when she asked me why I said, only this, that she is \"Too big for for me.\" She proceeded to say Fuck you and I hope you die. I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning. I am allowed to have a preference of non-fat people and if they ask why me, I believe it is justified that I don't sugarcoat shit and give them my truth.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for turning down a girl because she was fat. The question is phrased as an AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author rejected a girl based on her weight, stating they prefer non-fat people. The girl responded angrily, and the author admits they could have been nicer but thinks being honest was right. \n\nNow, considering societal norms and values. Weight is a sensitive topic, and using it as a reason to reject someone can be seen as discriminatory. However, personal preferences are part of human nature. The key here is whether the author's actions were wrong, not just based on their preference but how they communicated it.\n\nThe author was direct but maybe not empathetic. The response \"Too big for me\" is a bit blunt and could come off as hurtful. Even though the author had the right to their preference, the way they delivered it might have been unkind. The girl's reaction is understandable given the message received.\n\nAlso, the author's justification is that they have the right to their preference. While it's true that people have dating preferences, the manner in which they express those preferences can impact others. Being honest is one thing, but doing so without compassion might be lacking.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, treating people with respect and kindness is important. The author's approach might not have respected the girl's feelings, leading to a negative interaction. Even if the author believes they were truthful, the impact of their words is significant.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because while they have the right to their preferences, the way they expressed it was hurtful and lacked empathy. The question isn't about the right to have preferences but about how those preferences were communicated and the resulting harm.\n"
