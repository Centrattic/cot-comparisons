I told her \"Sorry but this isn't going to happen\" and when she asked me why I said, only this, that she is \"Too big for for me.\" She proceeded to say Fuck you and I hope you die. I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning. I am allowed to have a preference of non-fat people and if they ask why me, I believe it is justified that I don't sugarcoat shit and give them my truth.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who turned down a girl because she was fat is in the wrong. The question is presented as an AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and values. Weight is a personal preference, and people often have different standards. However, making someone feel bad about their body can be hurtful. The author was direct but used the term \"Too big for me,\" which might come off as insensitive. The girl's reaction was angry, which makes sense if she felt disrespected.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they could have been nicer. Even if they have a preference, the way they communicate it matters. Using a blunt statement without any cushioning can be seen as cruel. The key here is whether the author had the right to express their preference so directly without considering the other person's feelings.\n\nAnother angle is that the girl was set up by a friend, so maybe the author didn't know her well. Still, being honest is important, but honesty shouldn't be an excuse for being unkind. The author's response might be seen as dismissive rather than respectful.\n\nIn most AITA scenarios, being honest but tactless is often considered on the \"asshole\" side because it lacks empathy. The author's justification that they have the right to their preference is valid, but the delivery is where the problem lies. The person might not be wrong in having preferences, but the way they expressed them is what's questionable.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because the method of rejection was hurtful and lacked kindness, even if the preference itself isn't inherently wrong.\n"
