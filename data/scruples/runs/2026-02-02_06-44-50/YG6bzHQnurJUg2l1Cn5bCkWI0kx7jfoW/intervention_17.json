I told her \"Sorry but this isn't going to happen\" and when she asked me why I said, only this, that she is \"Too big for for me.\" She proceeded to say Fuck you and I hope you die. I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning. I am allowed to have a preference of non-fat people and if they ask why me, I believe it is justified that I don't sugarcoat shit and give them my truth.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning down a girl because she was fat. The situation is presented in a Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole\" question.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The author rejected someone based on her weight, using the phrase \"Too big for me.\" The responder called them out, and the author admits they could have been nicer but believes honesty is justified.\n\nKey points to consider: weight-based rejection is a sensitive issue. There's a societal context where body shaming is often discouraged. The author's reasoning is based on personal preference, but expressing it directly without sugarcoating might be seen as harsh. The other person's reaction was angry, which makes sense given the comment about her weight. The author's argument is about honesty, but does that excuse the directness?\n\nLegally, there's no wrongdoing here. But socially and ethically, it's different. The question is whether the author was in the wrong. The author's choice of words is the main issue. Telling someone they're \"too big\" can be hurtful and contribute to body shaming. Even if it's a personal preference, the way it's communicated matters. The author could have been honest without being offensive. The response was a clear emotional reaction, which the author acknowledges but still defends their approach.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because while the author had the right to decline, the phrasing and lack of tact were inappropriate. It's about how the rejection was delivered, not just the reason.\n"
