I told her \"Sorry but this isn't going to happen\" and when she asked me why I said, only this, that she is \"Too big for for me.\" She proceeded to say Fuck you and I hope you die. I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning. I am allowed to have a preference of non-fat people and if they ask why me, I believe it is justified that I don't sugarcoat shit and give them my truth.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who turned down a girl because she was fat is in the wrong. The situation is presented in a \"Am I the asshole\" format, which typically seeks community judgment on whether the narrator's actions were reasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The user (AITA) rejected a girl for being overweight, stating it directly as \"Too big for me.\" The girl responded angrily, and the user acknowledges they could have been nicer but believes honesty is justified. The question is whether the user is in the wrong.\n\nLooking at societal norms, body shaming is generally frowned upon. Even if someone has personal preferences, using weight as a direct reason for rejection can be hurtful. The user's response was straightforward but not kind. While they admit they could have been nicer, the core issue is whether it's acceptable to reject someone based on their size. \n\nIn many contexts, people are advised to be more compassionate, even when turning someone down. There's a difference between being honest and being hurtful. The user might argue personal preference, but the way it's delivered matters. The girl's angry response shows the impact of such a rejection.\n\nLegally, there's no issue, but socially and ethically, it's more complex. The user's transparency might be seen as honest, but the lack of empathy could be seen as wrong. The answer depends on balancing personal preferences with respect for others' feelings. The user isn't the first person to face this dilemma, but the directness here seems to cross into being inconsiderate.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong). The reasoning centers on the potential harm caused by the comment and the expectation to treat others with respect, even when declining.\n"
