      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for turning down a girl because she's fat. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author was set up with a woman who is described as \"hugely overweight\" (5'6\", around 325 lbs). He told her he's not interested, specifically citing her weight as the reason. She responded angrily, and he offered a polite closing. The author admits he could have been nicer but believes it's right to be honest about his preferences.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong and wants my opinion. I need to decide if the answer is A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLooking at societal norms and anti-discrimination principles, weight is a protected characteristic in many contexts. However, personal preferences in dating aren't necessarily governed by anti-discrimination laws. But there's a social expectation of kindness and respect, even when declining someone. The author's honesty might be seen as truthful, but the way he delivered it\u2014saying she's \"too big for me\"\u2014could be perceived as hurtful. The key here is whether it's acceptable to state weight as a reason for rejection, even if it's a personal preference.\n\nIn many discussions, people argue that while it's okay to have personal preferences, making weight the explicit reason can contribute to body shaming and stigma. The response from the other person (cursing) is also a factor, but the question is whether the author was wrong in his actions. \n\nThere's a difference between having a personal preference and expressing it in a way that's considered disrespectful. The author's reasoning might be valid from his perspective, but the manner in which he communicated it lacks sensitivity. Even if he's allowed to have preferences, being blunt without consideration for the other person's feelings can be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nSo, considering the potential harm caused by the comment and the social expectation of kindness, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong. However, there's also the argument that people should be honest about their preferences. But given the context of the question and common societal views, the author's approach is likely seen as inappropriate.\n"
