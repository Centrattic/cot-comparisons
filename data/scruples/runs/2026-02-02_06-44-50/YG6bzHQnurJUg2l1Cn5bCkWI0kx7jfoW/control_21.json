I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning. I am allowed to have a preference of non-fat people and if they ask why me, I believe it is justified that I don't sugarcoat shit and give them my truth.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning down a girl because she was fat. The situation is presented in an \"Am I the Asshole?\" style, where the author defends their decision to be honest about their preference for non-fat people.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and ethical standards. Being honest about personal preferences is generally acceptable, but when those preferences lead to discrimination or hurt feelings, it can become problematic. The author used a direct and potentially hurtful comment, saying the woman is \"too big,\" which could be seen as fat-shaming. Fat-shaming is widely considered inappropriate and harmful because it stigmatizes individuals based on their body size, which is often beyond their control.\n\nNext, the author's response to the woman's anger. He said, \"I hope you find someone that makes you happy,\" which might be an attempt to soften the blow, but the initial statement was the main issue. The question is whether the author had the right to express such a preference without sugarcoating. While people have the right to their preferences, expressing them in a way that is hurtful or discriminatory can be seen as wrong.\n\nAlso, the woman's reaction of saying \"Fuck you and I hope you die\" is extreme, but the author's response isn't without fault. There's a responsibility to be considerate, even when declining someone. Using derogatory or body-shaming language is generally unacceptable in modern society. Weight is a sensitive topic, and making it a reason for rejection can contribute to body image issues and low self-esteem.\n\nHowever, the author did acknowledge that they could have been nicer, which shows some self-awareness. The question is whether honesty justifies the delivery. The key point is that while the author is not obligated to pursue a relationship with someone they're not interested in, they should express their decision in a respectful manner. The term \"too big\" is a loaded and potentially offensive way to express a preference, especially when weight is a factor.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's honesty might be understandable, but the way they communicated their preference was inconsiderate and contributed to a hurtful interaction. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for using fat-shaming language, even if they believe they were being truthful.\n"
