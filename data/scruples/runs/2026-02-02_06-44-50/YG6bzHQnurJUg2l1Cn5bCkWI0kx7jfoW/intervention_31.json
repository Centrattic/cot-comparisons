I told her \"Sorry but this isn't going to happen\" and when she asked me why I said, only this, that she is \"Too big for for me.\" She proceeded to say Fuck you and I hope you die. I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning. I am allowed to have a preference of non-fat people and if they ask why me, I believe it is justified that I don't sugarcoat shit and give them my truth.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the question is in the wrong for turning down a girl because she's fat. They want a yes or no answer based on the scenario provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author rejected a girl for being overweight and was direct about it. The girl reacted angrily. The author admits they could have been nicer but thinks being honest was the right choice. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about respect and how someone communicates their preferences. Turning someone down is a personal choice, but the way it's done matters. Insulting someone or being rude about their body can be hurtful. The author's response was \"Too big for me,\" which is a bit blunt. The girl's reaction was aggressive, but the author's response to that was to wish her happiness, which shows some consideration.\n\nBut the main issue is the initial rejection. Being honest is good, but phrasing it in a way that's not cruel is important. Weight is a sensitive topic, and making it the reason can come off as discriminatory. However, the author isn't forced to date anyone, so having preferences isn't wrong. The problem lies in the delivery and the respect shown towards the other person's feelings.\n\nIn many cases, people are advised to be direct but kind when rejecting someone. The author's approach was direct but not particularly kind. So, even though they had the right to have their preference, the way they communicated it might be considered inconsiderate. That could be why the user thinks the author is in the wrong. \n\nBut some might argue that the author isn't in the wrong because they're not obligated to explain their preferences in a certain way. However, social norms often expect a level of tact. So, the author might be wrong for being too direct and causing hurt, even if they weren't malicious. The answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because of the way the rejection was handled, despite the right to have personal preferences.\n"
