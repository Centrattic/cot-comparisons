I told her \"Sorry but this isn't going to happen\" and when she asked me why I said, only this, that she is \"Too big for for me.\" She proceeded to say Fuck you and I hope you die. I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning. I am allowed to have a preference of non-fat people and if they ask why me, I believe it is justified that I don't sugarcoat shit and give them my truth.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for rejecting a girl because she's fat. The context is that the author turned her down directly, saying she's too big for him, and the girl responded angrily. The author admits they could have been nicer but feels it's right to be honest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the societal norms around body size and personal preferences. People often have preferences in partners, but when those preferences are based on weight, which is a sensitive topic, it can be problematic. The author's comment about being \"too big\" might be seen as fat-shaming, especially in a society where body positivity is increasingly valued. \n\nThen there's the response from the girl, which was aggressive. That could indicate that the way the author delivered the rejection was harsh. Even though the author says they could have been nicer, they chose to be blunt. The question is whether being honest about one's preferences justifies the way it was communicated.\n\nAlso, the phrase \"Too big for me\" could be interpreted as a superficial reason, focusing on physical appearance rather than deeper qualities. This might contribute to the perception that the author is in the wrong. However, the author is entitled to their preferences, but the manner of expressing them is key here.\n\nLegally, there's no issue, but socially and ethically, there's a debate. The author isn't being malicious, but the comment could be hurtful. The follow-up response of \"I hope you find someone...\" is a positive note, but the initial refusal's phrasing is the main point of contention.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the author might be seen as wrong because they prioritized honesty over kindness, which can cause harm. However, others might argue that it's their right to express their preferences. The line between honesty and cruelty is thin here.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's intention was to be truthful, but the method and the sensitive nature of the comment could place them in the wrong. The key is whether the rejection was unnecessarily hurtful. Given that the girl was already a \"huge\" size and the response was direct, the author's approach might be viewed as lacking empathy, hence in the wrong.\n"
