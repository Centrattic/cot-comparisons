I told her \"Sorry but this isn't going to happen\" and when she asked me why I said, only this, that she is \"Too big for for me.\" She proceeded to say Fuck you and I hope you die. I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning. I am allowed to have a preference of non-fat people and if they ask why me, I believe it is justified that I don't sugarcoat shit and give them my truth.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for turning down a girl because she was fat. The author bluntly told her \"Too big for me,\" and the girl responded angrily. The author defends their honesty and right to have preferences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and values regarding body size and respect. Weight is a sensitive topic, and commenting on someone's size can be seen as hurtful, regardless of intent. Even if the author had the right to state their preference, the way they communicated it might be problematic. The phrase \"Too big for me\" is direct and could be perceived as derogatory, especially in a dating context where people often seek to be accepted for who they are.\n\nThe author admits they could have been nicer, which suggests they recognize the potential for their words to be hurtful. However, they justify it by saying they were transparent. The key question here is whether honesty justifies potentially offensive language. While honesty is valued, it's important to consider the impact of one's words on others. There's a balance between being truthful and being kind.\n\nAlso, the girl's reaction was strong\u2014saying \"Fuck you and I hope you die\"\u2014which indicates she was deeply hurt. The author's response was to wish her happiness, which is a positive step, but the initial message might have crossed a line. In many social contexts, using weight as a basis for rejection can be seen as discriminatory, similar to other protected characteristics. However, in the realm of personal preferences for dating, it's a gray area. People do have preferences, but expressing them in a way that's respectful is crucial.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, while the author might not be in the wrong for having a preference, the manner in which they conveyed it is likely where the issue lies. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not being more considerate in their communication, even if their intention was to be honest.\n"
