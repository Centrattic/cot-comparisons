I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning. I am allowed to have a preference of non-fat people and if they ask why me, I believe it is justified that I don't sugarcoat shit and give them my truth.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who turned down a girl because she was fat is in the wrong. The scenario is from an \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) context.\n\nFirst, the person was set up by a friend with someone who is described as \"hugely overweight.\" He directly told her he wasn't interested because she was \"too big for me.\" She responded angrily, and he replied with a more positive wish for her happiness. He acknowledges he could have been nicer but stands by being honest about his preferences.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. The key points here are about respect, honesty, and the impact of his words. While it's important to be honest about personal preferences, the way he communicated his disinterest might be seen as hurtful. Telling someone they're too big in a direct rejection can be offensive, regardless of intent. Societal views on body size and weight are sensitive, and such a comment can contribute to body shaming. However, he did state his preference upfront and didn't engage in derogatory language beyond stating his preference. The question is whether his honesty justifies the blunt approach. In many AITA scenarios, the community tends to value kindness and consideration, even when being honest. So, while he's not necessarily malicious, the way he expressed his rejection could be seen as disrespectful. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because of the hurtful nature of the comment, despite his intention to be honest.\n"
