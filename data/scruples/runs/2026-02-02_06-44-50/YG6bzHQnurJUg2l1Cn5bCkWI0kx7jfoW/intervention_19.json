I told her \"Sorry but this isn't going to happen\" and when she asked me why I said, only this, that she is \"Too big for for me.\" She proceeded to say Fuck you and I hope you die. I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning. I am allowed to have a preference of non-fat people and if they ask why me, I believe it is justified that I don't sugarcoat shit and give them my truth.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the person who turned down a girl because she was fat is in the wrong. The question is presented as an AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario. The user already thinks the author is wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person rejected someone based on her weight, which is a physical attribute. The key points here are honesty versus respect. The author says they were being transparent about their preference, which is a personal choice. However, using the term \"too big for me\" might be seen as dismissive or hurtful, especially since weight is a sensitive topic for many people.\n\nSociety often stigmatizes people who are overweight, and making a direct comment about someone's weight as a reason to reject them can be seen as contributing to that stigma. Even if the person is honest, the way they communicate their preference can matter. The response from the girl was angry, but her reaction might also be influenced by feeling judged or discriminated against.\n\nThe author mentions they could have been nicer, which indicates they recognize that their approach might have been harsh. However, they justify it by saying they were truthful. The question is whether being truthful justifies potentially hurting someone's feelings. In social interactions, it's often expected to balance honesty with empathy. While it's okay to have personal preferences, expressing them in a way that's not cruel or dehumanizing is usually considered the right approach.\n\nAlso, considering the impact of such a rejection, the girl might feel devalued. The author's response of \"I hope you find someone that makes you happy\" is somewhat kind, but the initial statement was the main issue. The key is whether the author's action was respectful. Weight is a protected characteristic in some contexts, and discrimination based on that can be problematic.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, even though the author was honest, the way they communicated their preference was likely hurtful and not respectful. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
