I told her \"Sorry but this isn't going to happen\" and when she asked me why I said, only this, that she is \"Too big for for me.\" She proceeded to say Fuck you and I hope you die. I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning. I am allowed to have a preference of non-fat people and if they ask why me, I believe it is justified that I don't sugarcoat shit and give them my truth.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The scenario is presented in a Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole\" format.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author rejected someone based on her weight, stating it directly as the reason. The girl responded angrily. The author admits they could have been nicer but believes it's justified to be honest about their preferences.\n\nThe key points here are about respect and how one communicates their preferences. Even if someone has personal preferences, the way they express them matters. Saying someone is \"too big\" can be hurtful and might be seen as discriminatory. Weight is a sensitive topic, and making it the reason for rejection can be offensive. The author's response was direct but not considerate of the person's feelings. While preferences are personal, being transparent in a way that's honest yet kind is important. The author's approach might be seen as lacking empathy, hence making them the asshole. So, the answer is A.\n"
