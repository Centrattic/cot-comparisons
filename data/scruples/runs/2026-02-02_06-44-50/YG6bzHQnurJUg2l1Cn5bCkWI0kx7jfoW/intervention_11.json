I told her \"Sorry but this isn't going to happen\" and when she asked me why I said, only this, that she is \"Too big for for me.\" She proceeded to say Fuck you and I hope you die. I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning. I am allowed to have a preference of non-fat people and if they ask why me, I believe it is justified that I don't sugarcoat shit and give them my truth.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who rejected a girl because she was overweight is in the wrong. They provided a Reddit-style question where the author defends their decision, saying they were honest about their preference for non-fat people.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the justification based on personal preference versus the potential harm caused. The author says they were transparent and that they have the right to their preferences. But weight is a protected class in some places, and making a judgment based on weight might be seen as discriminatory. Also, the way they communicated it was blunt, leading to a hostile reaction from the girl.\n\nI need to consider societal norms and ethics. While it's true that people have personal preferences, using weight as a reason for rejection can contribute to body shaming, which is harmful. The author's approach was direct, but maybe they could have been more compassionate. The girl's response was aggressive, but the author's honesty might have triggered that. \n\nAlso, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If we look at the situation from a moral standpoint, rejecting someone based on weight is a form of prejudice, even if it's personal. The author's reasoning might not be inherently wrong, but the way they expressed it and the impact on the other person could be problematic. \n\nHowever, some might argue that it's their right to be honest about their preferences. But the problem arises when that honesty is unkind. The author admits they could have been nicer, which suggests they recognize the potential for harm. So, while the preference isn't necessarily wrong, the lack of sensitivity in delivery and the justification of it as \"giving their truth\" without considering the other person's feelings could be where they cross into being in the wrong.\n\nI think the answer leans towards A, the author is in the wrong, because the rejection based on weight and the blunt delivery contribute to a hurtful interaction, even if the intent was to be honest.\n"
