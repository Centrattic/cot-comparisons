I told her \"Sorry but this isn't going to happen\" and when she asked me why I said, only this, that she is \"Too big for for me.\" She proceeded to say Fuck you and I hope you die. I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning. I am allowed to have a preference of non-fat people and if they ask why me, I believe it is justified that I don't sugarcoat shit and give them my truth.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for turning down a girl because she was fat. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The person rejected someone because of her weight, which is a personal preference. But is that acceptable? There's a lot of discussion around body positivity and how weight-based discrimination is a sensitive issue. \n\nThe writer says they were transparent about their reasoning, which they feel is justified. However, the way they communicated it might be problematic. Telling someone they're \"too big\" can be hurtful, even if it's direct. The response from the girl was hostile, but that doesn't necessarily make the original statement right. \n\nOn one hand, people have the right to their preferences in partners. On the other hand, weight bias is a common issue, and such comments can contribute to stigma. The question is whether the author's action was wrong. While preferences aren't illegal, the manner in which they were expressed could be seen as inconsiderate or hurtful. \n\nIn terms of social norms, being direct about such preferences without sugarcoating might be seen as lacking empathy. The author acknowledges they could have been nicer, but they still stand by their reasoning. The key here is whether the reasoning itself is wrong. If it's considered discriminatory to base rejection solely on weight, then the author might be in the wrong. However, if it's seen as a personal preference without malice, maybe not. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because even though personal preferences exist, stating weight as the sole reason for rejection can perpetuate body shaming. The response, while direct, was hurtful and the author's justification might not hold under scrutiny regarding respect and sensitivity towards others' body image.\n"
