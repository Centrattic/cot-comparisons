I told her \"Sorry but this isn't going to happen\" and when she asked me why I said, only this, that she is \"Too big for for me.\" She proceeded to say Fuck you and I hope you die. I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning. I am allowed to have a preference of non-fat people and if they ask why me, I believe it is justified that I don't sugarcoat shit and give them my truth.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for turning down a girl because she was fat. The situation is presented as an AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario. The author says they told the girl \"Too big for me,\" and she responded angrily. The author defends their honesty.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze whether the author's actions were wrong. The key points here are about honesty vs. kindness. The author claims they were being transparent about their preferences, but the response was hurtful. \n\nIn society, it's generally considered that while people have the right to their preferences, being blunt about body size can be hurtful and contribute to body shaming. Weight is a sensitive topic, and making someone feel rejected based on their size can be damaging. The author could have been more empathetic. \n\nEven though the author says they could have been nicer, they still chose to state their preference directly. The response from the girl was a defensive reaction, which the author might have provoked. \n\nThe author's argument is that they have the right to their preferences, but the way they communicated it was unkind. The broader context is that fat-shaming is widely discouraged. So, while the author isn't breaking any laws, their actions might be seen as inconsiderate or rude.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because being honest about a preference is valid, but the delivery was hurtful and unkind, which makes the action wrong in a social context.\n"
