I told her \"Sorry but this isn't going to happen\" and when she asked me why I said, only this, that she is \"Too big for for me.\" She proceeded to say Fuck you and I hope you die. I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning. I am allowed to have a preference of non-fat people and if they ask why me, I believe it is justified that I don't sugarcoat shit and give them my truth.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for turning down a girl because she was fat. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author says he rejected a girl due to her size, which is 5'6\" and around 325 lbs. He told her directly that she's \"too big for me.\" The girl responded angrily, and he justified his honesty. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants to know the perspective here.\n\nHmm. Body size is a personal preference, right? But there's also the aspect of how you communicate that preference. The author was direct and didn't sugarcoat it. Some might argue that being honest is okay, but others might see it as hurtful, especially since body image can be a sensitive issue. The girl's reaction was aggressive, but does that make the author right or wrong?\n\nAlso, considering societal context, weight discrimination is a real issue. Telling someone they're rejected because of their size could be seen as contributing to that problem. However, the author isn't obligated to date someone they don't prefer. But the way he communicated it was blunt. Maybe there's a balance between honesty and empathy here. \n\nThe key points are: Is it acceptable to reject someone based on their body size? How does the delivery of that rejection matter? While the author isn't legally wrong, socially or morally, it's debatable. Some might say he should have been more tactful, even if he's honest. Others might support his right to be upfront. But since the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" it's more about social judgment. \n\nGiven that the author admitted he could have been nicer but insisted on transparency, the main issue is whether being transparent is more important than being kind. But in social contexts, kindness is often valued over blunt honesty. So leaning towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the hurtful delivery, even if the reasoning is a personal preference. However, the line is thin here.\n"
