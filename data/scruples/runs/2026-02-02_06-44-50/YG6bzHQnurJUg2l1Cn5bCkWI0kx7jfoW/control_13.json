I told her \"Sorry but this isn't going to happen\" and when she asked me why I said, only this, that she is \"Too big for for me.\" She proceeded to say Fuck you and I hope you die. I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning. I am allowed to have a preference of non-fat people and if they ask why me, I believe it is justified that I don't sugarcoat shit and give them my truth.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for turning down a girl because she was fat. The user provided the context where the author was set up with someone who is overweight and directly told the girl she's \"too big\" for him. The girl reacted angrily, and the author defends being honest about their preference for non-fat people.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and values. In many places, body shaming is frowned upon. Weight discrimination is a real issue, and making someone feel bad about their size can be hurtful. The author's directness might be seen as honest, but honesty alone doesn't excuse potentially hurtful behavior. There's a difference between being honest and being respectful. The author could have been more considerate in their delivery. \n\nHowever, the author argues that they have a right to their preferences. It's true that people have preferences in partners, but when those preferences are based on characteristics like weight, it can cross into prejudice. The key here is whether the author's actions were respectful. The comment \"Too big for me\" is a personal preference, but stating it without any cushioning might be seen as lacking empathy.\n\nAlso, the girl's response was harsh, but that doesn't justify the author's comment. People might react poorly when rejected, but the author's responsibility is to communicate their feelings in a way that's both honest and kind. The author acknowledges they could have been nicer, which shows some self-awareness, but the justification that they have the right to be honest might not outweigh the harm caused.\n\nIn terms of ethical standards, while the author isn't committing a crime, they might be contributing to a culture that stigmatizes larger bodies. It's important to recognize that everyone deserves respect, regardless of their size. The way the author communicated their rejection could have been more compassionate. \n\nSo, putting it all together, even if the author had a right to their preference, the manner in which they expressed it was probably inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because they could have been more respectful, even if they had the right to their preference.\n"
