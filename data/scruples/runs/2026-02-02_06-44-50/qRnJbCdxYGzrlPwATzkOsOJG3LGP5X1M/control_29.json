C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the guy dated a girl for three years in high school. She had a tough background, with a father who left and a mother who committed suicide. Her upbringing was with devout Catholic grandparents, which influenced her religious views. She has bipolar disorder, which caused mood swings. She wanted to get married and have a family, but he didn't want to propose. She got pregnant, but had Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, making pregnancy less likely. She hid the pregnancy, then he convinced her to get an abortion, but when they went to the airport, the cat died, which they saw as a sign from God to keep the baby. He broke up with her after she decided to keep the child. Now, the kid is 5, and the author isn't involved, causing guilt but he still thinks she was selfish.\n\nSo, the main question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's look at the key points. He didn't want kids, she wanted them. She got pregnant and tried to abort, but then changed her mind because of the cat incident. He broke up with her, refuses to be involved. He pays child support but doesn't see his son. Others think he's wrong for not being part of the child's life.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, he's paying child support, which is his responsibility. But emotionally and ethically, is he wrong? He argues she was being selfish by getting pregnant without his consent. But she might argue that he was being selfish by not wanting to be a parent. Both sides have valid points. However, in most societies, parenthood is considered a shared responsibility once a child is born, regardless of the circumstances. Even if the pregnancy was a result of deception, the child's welfare is a consideration. His refusal to engage with his son might be seen as neglectful, especially as the child is starting school and asking about his father. The author's guilt is mentioned, which complicates things. \n\nLegally, he has obligations. Ethically, there's a societal expectation to be part of your child's life. Even if the pregnancy was unwanted, once the child exists, responsibilities arise. His stance seems to be based on the belief that she disrespected him by deceiving him, but his current actions might be harming the child. People might argue that he's being selfish by not taking responsibility. \n\nOn the other hand, his perspective is valid\u2014he wasn't ready, and she manipulated the situation. But the cat incident seems like a pretext to avoid the abortion, which he might have considered coercion. However, after the child is born, cutting off completely is problematic. \n\nIn terms of societal judgment, most would likely side with the idea that he should be involved in his child's life. Even if he feels wronged initially, the child's well-being is a separate issue. So, the consensus might be that he's in the wrong for not being present for his son. Answer A: Yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
