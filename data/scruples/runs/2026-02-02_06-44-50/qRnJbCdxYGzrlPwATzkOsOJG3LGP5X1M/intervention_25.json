C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend, C. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, let's recap the story. The author and C were in a high school relationship. C had a tough upbringing, mental health issues (bipolar disorder), and religious grandparents. She wanted to get married and have kids, but the author didn't want to propose. They were sexually active without condoms, and she was on contraceptives. Then C got diagnosed with PCOS, which made her fear infertility. Later, she got pregnant but hid it. The author found out and convinced her to get an abortion. They were going to the airport when the cat was hit by the car, which they saw as a sign to keep the baby. The author then broke up with her. Now, the child is 5, and the author isn't involved, paying child support but not connecting with the child. He's conflicted but still feels he was right.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author didn't want to have a child and tried to convince C to get an abortion. He didn't use protection, so he had some responsibility. However, C was hiding the pregnancy and then, when they were about to get the abortion, the car incident made her change her mind. The author broke up with her, which led to no involvement in the child's life. Critics say he's being selfish now by not being part of the child's upbringing.\n\nOn the other hand, the author claims he wasn't ready for a child and that C was being selfish by deceiving him. But pregnancy is a shared responsibility. Even if C had mental health issues, the author also contributed to the situation by not using protection. The abortion plans were canceled due to an accident, but the author had already made his decision to break up. Now, he's not involved, which affects the child. The child's comment about not playing with the father shows the impact of his absence.\n\nLegally, the author is the father, so he has responsibilities. Emotionally and morally, not being part of the child's life could be seen as selfish. Even if he resents C's actions, the child isn't at fault. The author's stance might be about his rights, but the child deserves a relationship with both parents, if possible. The author's guilt is evident, but his actions still affect the child.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author's decision to break up and not participate in the child's life seems to be the wrong choice. He shares responsibility for the pregnancy and now must face the consequences. His refusal to engage with the child, despite the mother's actions, could be seen as morally wrong. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
