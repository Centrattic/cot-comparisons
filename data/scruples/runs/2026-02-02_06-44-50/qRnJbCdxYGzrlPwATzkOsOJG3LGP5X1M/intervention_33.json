C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The scenario is complex with a lot of emotional and ethical factors at play.\n\nFirst, the author broke up with his girlfriend after she got pregnant. The girlfriend had a traumatic past, including her parents' deaths and being raised by devout grandparents. She had mental health issues (bipolar disorder) and was very focused on having a family. Initially, she tried to push the author into marriage, but when that didn't happen, she used contraception but then developed a condition making pregnancy harder. Then, despite the doctor's advice, she got pregnant and tried to get an abortion but had a change of heart when her cat died before the procedure. The author felt forced into a situation he didn't want and broke up with her. Now, the child is 5, and the author isn't involved, causing the child to feel abandoned.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the user says they think the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider both sides. The author claims he was deceived and that the pregnancy was a result of her manipulation. However, he was aware they weren't using condoms, and she was on birth control. The failure of the birth control could be a factor. Also, the author's ultimatum\u2014me or the baby\u2014might be seen as putting pressure on her to abort, but she changed her mind when the cat died. The author then left her, leading to the child being raised without the father.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is now avoiding his parental responsibilities. Even if he didn't want the child, he has a legal and moral obligation to support and be involved. The child's well-being is important, and the author's absence is affecting him emotionally. The author might feel wronged because he wasn't ready, but once a child is born, the responsibilities don't end. He's paying child support, but not being present. The mother's actions were questionable, but that doesn't absolve the father of his role.\n\nEthically, while the mother's deception and possible mental instability are factors, the father also has a duty. The author's decision to cut off contact might be seen as self-preservation, but it's causing harm to the child. Legally, he's fulfilling some obligations, but emotionally, he's not. So, I think the author is in the wrong because he's not taking responsibility for his child's upbringing despite the circumstances. The mother's actions were problematic, but the father's lack of involvement now is causing ongoing harm. The author needs to consider the child's needs beyond just financial support.\n"
