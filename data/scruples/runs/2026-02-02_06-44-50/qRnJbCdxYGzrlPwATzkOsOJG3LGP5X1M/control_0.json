C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he broke up with his pregnant girlfriend after she had already decided to keep the child following a series of events where they were supposed to get an abortion but a cat was run over, leading them to believe it was a miracle from God.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author's side is that he wasn't ready to have a child, the girlfriend was being selfish by getting pregnant and then deciding to keep the child despite his objections. He felt pressured and didn't want to be a parent. On the other hand, the girlfriend had a history of mental health issues and a traumatic upbringing, which might have influenced her decision-making. She was taking birth control but still got pregnant, and when she couldn't have kids due to PCOS, she became obsessed with having a family. The author's decision to break up and not be involved in the child's life has caused family conflicts and his son is now affected by his absence.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and responsibility. The author argues that he wasn't ready and had no say, but once the child is born, does the father have a responsibility regardless of the circumstances? Even if he didn't want to have a child, once the child exists, is it his responsibility to be involved? Also, the girlfriend might have had mental health issues that could have impacted her decision-making, which the author might have needed to consider.\n\nAnother angle is the circumstances of the pregnancy. The author didn't use protection, and they were having unprotected sex. He mentioned that he was taking birth control, but he also admitted that he didn't use condoms. So, there's some responsibility on both sides for the pregnancy. However, the girlfriend hid the pregnancy and lied about it, which the author found disrespectful. But when the time came to abort, the cat died, leading her to believe it was a sign from God. That's a cultural or religious perspective that the author might not agree with, leading to the breakup.\n\nNow, considering the child's well-being. The child is growing up without a father figure, which is affecting his emotional state. The author is paying child support but not engaging in a parent-child relationship. Child support is legal, but emotional and social involvement is another matter. The author's parents are involved, which is good, but the father's absence is still impacting the child's perception.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, even if the author didn't want the child, once he became a father, he has a duty to be part of the child's life. The argument could be made that his decision to not be involved is harming the child, regardless of his personal feelings. However, the author feels wronged because he believes the mother was selfish and deceitful.\n\nLegally, in many places, parents have responsibilities toward their children regardless of the circumstances of the birth. So, the author might be legally obligated to be involved, even if he doesn't want to. Morally, it's more complex. The mother's actions were questionable, but the child is innocent. The author's stance could be seen as neglectful because he's not providing a father figure, which is crucial for the child's development.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have valid reasons for his stance. He wasn't given a choice when the pregnancy happened, and the mother's actions were manipulative. He might feel that being involved would mean validating her actions. However, the child's well-being is a separate issue from the parents' past conflicts.\n\nIn conclusion, while the mother's actions were problematic, the father's decision to completely disengage from his son's life could be seen as selfish and harmful to the child. The author might be in the wrong because he's prioritizing his personal feelings over the child's needs. The mother's mental health and actions don't excuse the father's lack of involvement, especially since the child deserves both parents' love and presence as much as possible.\n"
