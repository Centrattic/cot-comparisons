C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is a guy who broke up with his pregnant girlfriend after she had initially agreed to an abortion but then changed her mind when a cat was run over on the way to the airport. He's been paying child support but hasn't been involved with the child, and now the child is starting school and mentioning not having a daddy to play with. The author feels wronged because he wasn't ready for a child and believes she was selfish for getting pregnant without his consent.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal and ethical aspects. In most places, once a child is born, the legal responsibility for the child includes the father, especially if paternity is established. The author is paying child support, which is legally required, but emotional and social involvement is a different matter. However, withholding contact from a child might be considered harmful in the long run, even if the parent doesn't want to be involved. \n\nThe girlfriend did lie about the pregnancy, which is a significant betrayal. But once the child was born, the author became a parent, and there might be a societal expectation for him to be involved. However, the situation started with the girlfriend deceiving him, which complicates things. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author's decision to break up and not engage with the child could be seen as selfish too. The child has a right to a relationship with both parents, assuming it's safe and healthy. The author might be prioritizing his own feelings over the child's needs. \n\nBut there's also the initial deception by the girlfriend. She manipulated the situation by hiding the pregnancy and then changing her mind at the last minute. That's a serious breach of trust. The author might feel that he was coerced into a situation he didn't want, which adds complexity. \n\nI should also consider the mental health aspects. The girlfriend has bipolar disorder and a troubled upbringing, which might have influenced her decisions. The author might be reacting to her instability, but that doesn't necessarily absolve him of responsibility once the child is born. \n\nIn terms of societal judgment, the author is being criticized for not being involved, but the initial betrayal by the girlfriend is a mitigating factor. However, the child's well-being is a strong argument against the author's current stance. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, he was deceived and wasn't ready for parenthood. On the other, the child deserves a relationship with both parents. The author's refusal to engage, despite the circumstances, could be seen as harmful. But considering the betrayal and lack of consent, maybe it's not entirely his fault. \n\nBut the key point is that once the child is born, the father's responsibilities extend beyond financial support. The author's decision to cut off contact entirely might be the more harmful choice. Therefore, he is likely in the wrong for not taking responsibility for the child's emotional needs, even if the initial situation was unfair to him.\n"
