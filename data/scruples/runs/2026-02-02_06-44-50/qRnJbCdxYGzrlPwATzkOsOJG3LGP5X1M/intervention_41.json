C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. The situation is complicated, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the author and his girlfriend, C, were in a long-term high school relationship. C had a tough upbringing and is now dealing with bipolar disorder, which might have contributed to her wanting to have a family. The author wasn't interested in marriage or kids, but they were sexually active without protection, leading to her pregnancy. They had planned an abortion, but when the cat died before the trip, they decided to keep the child instead. The author then broke up with her and hasn't been involved in the child's life, despite paying child support.\n\nThe author feels wronged because he wasn't ready for a child and believes C was selfish. However, others are judging him for abandoning the child. The key points here are consent to parenthood, the sudden change in plans due to the cat's death, and the ongoing lack of involvement in the child's life.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, he's paying child support, so he's fulfilling that duty. Emotionally and ethically, though, there's a lot to consider. C did deceive him by hiding her pregnancy, which is a serious breach of trust. But once the child was born, the author has a responsibility towards the child regardless of his relationship with C. The child's well-being is a significant factor here. The fact that the child is now saying, \"my daddy doesn't play with me\" shows the impact of his absence.\n\nThe author might argue that he wasn't given a choice and that C's actions were manipulative. However, by not being involved in the child's life, he's neglecting his parental responsibilities. Even if the circumstances were forced, once the child exists, the parent has a duty to be part of their life. The author's stance that he doesn't want to validate C's disrespect by changing his mind is a bit of an excuse for not prioritizing his child's needs.\n\nSo, while C's actions were certainly wrong and manipulative, the author's decision to disengage entirely from his child's life seems to be where he's in the wrong. The child is the innocent party here, and his lack of involvement is hurting the child. Even if the initial situation was beyond his control, the ongoing neglect is his own choice now. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
