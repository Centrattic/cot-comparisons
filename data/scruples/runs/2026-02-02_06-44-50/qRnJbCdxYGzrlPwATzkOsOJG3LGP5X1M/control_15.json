C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The situation is pretty complicated with a lot of factors. So, the guy ended a relationship with a girl who he had a child with. The girl had a traumatic past, mental health issues, and they ended up in a situation where she got pregnant. He wanted an abortion, but she changed her mind after the cat was hit by the car, which she and her family saw as a miracle. He broke up with her and hasn't been involved in the child's life, only paying child support.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author's argument is that he wasn't ready for a child and that the girl was being selfish by getting pregnant without his consent. He felt she deceived him by hiding the pregnancy and then changing her mind about the abortion. He also mentions her mental health issues and how they contributed to her wanting a family despite medical issues.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl had significant trauma and mental health challenges, which might have affected her decision-making. The author's decision to break up and not be involved in his son's life could be seen as abandoning responsibility. Children need parental involvement, and even though the father didn't want the child initially, he's financially supporting him but not emotionally or socially. The recent comment from the child about his daddy not playing with him adds emotional weight to the situation.\n\nLegally, the father might have obligations beyond just financial, but in terms of morality, there's a lot to consider. The author might feel wronged because he wasn't ready, but the child's well-being is also important. The girl's actions were questionable, but the father's refusal to engage could be seen as selfish too. There's also the issue of consent\u2014did he consent to have a child? He didn't want to, but the pregnancy was a result of their sexual relationship without protection. That complicates things.\n\nMentally, the girl's issues might mean she wasn't in a good place to make such a big decision, but the father also made a choice to not use protection. The cat incident being a 'miracle' is a red flag\u2014it seems like a superstitious reason to keep the child, which might not be rational.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, even if the father didn't want the child, being a part of the child's life is important. His stance that he won't change his mind might be seen as inflexible. The guilt he's feeling might be valid, but his actions have consequences. The child deserves a relationship with both parents, unless there's abuse or neglect, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author probably is in the wrong. While the girl had issues, the father has a responsibility to his child. His initial refusal to take responsibility, breaking up, and not being involved despite financial support is harmful. The fact that the child is starting to express feelings about his father not being there shows the impact. The author's actions might be seen as selfish, even if he has his reasons. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
