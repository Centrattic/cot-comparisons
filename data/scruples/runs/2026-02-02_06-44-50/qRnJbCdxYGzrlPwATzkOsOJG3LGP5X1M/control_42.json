C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is he broke up with his pregnant girlfriend, C, after she decided to keep the baby despite his insistence on an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. He was in a 3-year high school relationship. C has a traumatic background with mental health issues (bipolar disorder) and a strong religious influence. She wanted to get married and have a family, but he wasn't interested in marriage. They were sexually active without condoms, and she was on birth control, which might have failed. She got PCOS, which made her fear infertility, so she got pregnant secretly. He wanted an abortion, but she changed her mind when her cat died, seeing it as a miracle. He broke up with her after she decided to keep the baby. Now he refuses to have contact with his son, despite paying child support. He feels she was selfish, but he's also feeling guilt when hearing his son says he doesn't play with him.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, he didn't want to be a parent and tried to get an abortion, which she refused. He ended the relationship, which could be seen as his right, but then cutting off contact with his child might be problematic. On the other hand, he's facing criticism for not being involved in his child's life, which is a big responsibility. Also, C's mental health and possible manipulation (deceiving him about the pregnancy) might play a role. But does that make his current stance justified?\n\nLegally, he's paying child support, which is required. But emotionally and morally, is it wrong to not be involved? The child has a right to know his father, and the father might have responsibilities beyond just financial. The author's argument is that C deceived him and was selfish, but his own refusal to engage could also be seen as selfish. The fact that he hasn't tried to reconcile despite his son's feelings might tip the scales towards him being in the wrong. Also, his stance that he never wanted a child and she knew that doesn't absolve him of being part of his child's life. So maybe the answer leans towards A, he's in the wrong, because even if the circumstances are complex, cutting off completely and not engaging despite the child's needs could be considered morally wrong.\n"
