C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. From the story, there's a lot to unpack.\n\nFirst, the author and his girlfriend C were in a high school relationship. C had a traumatic background with a father who left and a mother who died by suicide. She's raised by devout Catholic grandparents and has bipolar disorder. This might explain her strong desire to have a family. The author didn't want to get married, and C was pushing for marriage and kids. They were using birth control but not condoms, and then C got pregnant. The author convinced her to have an abortion, but she changed her mind after an incident with her cat being hit by a car, which she and her family interpreted as a miracle. She then had the baby, and the author broke up with her and hasn't been involved.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider both sides. The author felt pressured into a situation he wasn't ready for, and C's deception (hiding the pregnancy) is a factor. However, once the child was born, the author stopped involvement, which is a major issue. Child support is being paid, but he avoids contact. The child is now 5 and mentioned missing his dad. Legally, the father has responsibilities, and cutting off contact entirely could be seen as abandoning the child.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he wasn't ready and felt disrespected. But from a societal and ethical standpoint, children have a right to a relationship with both parents. The author's actions might be seen as neglecting his parental duties. Even if the circumstances were messy, walking away completely might not be the responsible choice. However, C's manipulation and the author's lack of consent in the child's creation could argue for his perspective. But the fact remains that he's the biological father, and the child has a right to know him.\n\nIt's a tough call. The author's stance is firm, but the consequences for the child are significant. The author's guilt over the child's feelings, as shown by the comment about the dad not playing, suggests he knows something's wrong. So, while there are valid points on both sides, the act of not engaging with the child despite being a parent likely makes the author at fault. So, answer A.\n"
