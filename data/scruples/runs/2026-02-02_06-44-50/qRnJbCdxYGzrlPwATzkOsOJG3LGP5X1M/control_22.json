C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nSo, the author had a relationship with a girl named C, who had a tough upbringing and became religious. She wanted to get married and have a family, but when it didn't happen, she panicked. They had a sexual relationship without condoms, and she was on birth control. Then she got diagnosed with PCOS, which made her fear infertility. Later, she got pregnant and hid it. The author found out and pressured her to get an abortion, which she almost did but then a cat was killed in front of the car, leading her to believe it was a sign from God to keep the baby. The author broke up with her, hasn't been involved in the child's life, pays child support, but refuses contact. Now the child is 5 and says his daddy doesn't play with him, causing guilt but the author remains firm.\n\nFirst, the author's stance: he didn't want children and felt C was selfish for getting pregnant. He felt deceived because she hid the pregnancy and forced an ultimatum. He's been paying child support but hasn't been involved. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, legal obligations exist. In many places, parents have legal responsibility for their children, including financial and emotional support. The author is fulfilling the financial part but not the emotional or parental role. The child deserves a relationship with both parents unless there's a good reason not to. The author's refusal to engage might be seen as neglecting the child's best interests, especially since the child is expressing confusion and sadness.\n\nOn the other hand, the author felt pressured by C to have a child when he wasn't ready. There's a mutual agreement that he didn't want children, but C proceeded against his wishes. There's a sense of betrayal here. However, once the child exists, the author's responsibility might extend beyond just financial support. Also, C's mental health issues (bipolar) and the manipulation (hiding pregnancy, using the cat incident) might be factors, but the author's decision to cut ties completely could be seen as selfish now, especially affecting the child.\n\nEthically, while the author might feel wronged initially, the child is innocent and deserves a relationship with the father. The author's stance now might be causing harm to the child. Legally, he's meeting obligations, but morally, many might argue that being a father also involves emotional presence. The author's refusal to change his decision despite the child's feelings might be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nConsidering both perspectives, the author's actions now could be seen as in the wrong because the child's well-being is important. Even if there was a past disagreement, the child needs both parents. The author's guilt is a sign that he's aware of this, but his decision to remain distant continues to impact the child negatively. So, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
