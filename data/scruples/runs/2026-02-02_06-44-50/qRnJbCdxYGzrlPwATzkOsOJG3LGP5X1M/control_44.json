C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author broke up with his pregnant girlfriend, who later had their child but he refuses to be involved. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and his girlfriend C were in a 3-year high school relationship. C had a tough upbringing with her father abandoning her and her mother committing suicide. She was raised by devout Catholic grandparents and has bipolar disorder. Their relationship had issues when C wanted to get married and have a family, but the author wasn't interested. They were sexually active without condoms despite her using oral contraceptives. Then C was diagnosed with PCOS, which made her worried about fertility. \n\nAfter some time, C got pregnant and hid it. The author found out and pushed for an abortion, giving her an ultimatum. They were about to go to Melbourne for it, but on the way, C's cat was run over, which she and her family saw as a miracle from God to keep the child. The author broke up with her, and now the kid is 5, with the author not involved but paying support. He feels guilty but still believes C was selfish and disrespectful.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the author is paying child support, so he's fulfilling his obligations. But ethically and socially, it's more complex. Both parties have responsibilities. The girlfriend did hide the pregnancy and went against his wishes, which could be seen as manipulative. However, the author didn't use protection, and even though he said he wasn't ready, he had the opportunity to take responsibility. \n\nThe cat incident leading her to keep the child is a key point. The author might feel he was tricked, but once the pregnancy was confirmed, he made the choice to leave. Now, the child is growing up without a father, which could impact the child's well-being. The author's parents are involved, but he's not. \n\nConsidering societal norms and the child's best interest, most people would argue that the author should be involved. But the author insists that C disrespected him by tricking him, and he's not ready. The debate here is between the right to refuse parenthood versus the child's right to both parents. \n\nIn many places, once a child is born, the legal and moral responsibility is shared. Even if the author didn't want the child, he's now a parent. So, by not engaging beyond child support, he's being a disengaged parent. However, C's actions in hiding the pregnancy and possibly manipulating the situation could be seen as wrong too. \n\nBut the author is the one who is actively disengaged. The child is starting school and asking about his dad. The author's parents are involved, but the father's presence is important. The author's guilt suggests he might have some regret, but he's doubling down on his stance. \n\nSo, while the girlfriend made bad choices, the author's refusal to be part of the child's life beyond financial support is likely seen as the bigger wrong. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
