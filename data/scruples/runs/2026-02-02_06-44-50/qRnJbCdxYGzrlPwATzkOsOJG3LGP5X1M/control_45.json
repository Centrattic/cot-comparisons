C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up with a pregnant girlfriend after she decided to keep the baby following a car accident that killed her cat, which she and her grandparents saw as a sign from God.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was in a relationship with C, who has a traumatic background and bipolar disorder. C wanted to get married and have a family, but when it became clear the author wasn't interested in marriage, she started panicking. They were sexually active without using condoms, and the author didn't think about contraception. Then C was diagnosed with PCOS, which made her less likely to conceive, leading to her obsession with the idea of starting a family. \n\nAfter the pregnancy was discovered, the author pleaded with C to get an abortion and gave her an ultimatum. They even tried to go to Melbourne for the procedure, but on the day of the flight, C's cat was hit and killed by the car, which they interpreted as a divine sign to keep the baby. The author broke up with her shortly after and hasn't been involved in the child's life, though he pays child support. Now, the child is asking about his \"daddy,\" and the author is conflicted but still firm in his decision, feeling that C was selfish in deceiving him to fulfill her fantasy.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me consider the ethical aspects here. The author had a right to his reproductive choices, but he didn't use protection, which is a key point. He also gave an ultimatum, which might be seen as pressuring C, even if he was against the pregnancy. However, once the abortion didn't go through due to the cat incident, he broke up and hasn't engaged with the child. \n\nOn the other hand, C's mental health issues (bipolar and PCOS) likely affected her decision-making. She might have felt desperate to have a child, especially given her past. The deception (hiding the pregnancy) is a problem, but the author also didn't use condoms, so he's not without fault. The author's refusal to be involved now could impact the child's well-being, as children often benefit from having a father figure. \n\nLegally, he's paying child support, so he's meeting that obligation. But morally, is it right to cut off contact? The user's perspective is that he was wronged by C's actions, but his current stance might be considered selfish too. However, he's not the one who chose to carry the pregnancy to term against his wishes. C made that decision, possibly due to her own mental health and religious beliefs. \n\nThe author's actions\u2014breaking up and not engaging\u2014could be seen as a way to remove himself from a situation he didn't consent to. But the child's needs are important. The guilt from the author's side is there, so maybe he's conflicted. The community's judgment is likely because he's the biological father and is not involved. However, the initial situation involved coercion or at least lack of consent. \n\nIn the end, while the author made mistakes, like not using protection and giving an ultimatum, the fact that C proceeded without his consent complicates things. But his refusal to be part of the child's life now, even though he's paying support, might be seen as wrong because it affects the child. So the answer could lean towards A (yes, he's in the wrong) because he's the father and has a responsibility, even if he didn't want it. But there's nuance with C's actions. However, the community typically expects fathers to be involved once the child is born unless there's abuse or neglect. The author's lack of contact might be more harmful than his initial decision to leave. So the answer is A.\n"
