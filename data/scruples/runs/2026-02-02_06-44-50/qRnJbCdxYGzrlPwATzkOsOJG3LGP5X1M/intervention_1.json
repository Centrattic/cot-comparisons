C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me start by breaking down the key points of the story.\n\nThe author had a 3-year relationship with a girl named C in high school. C had a tough upbringing and became very religious. She was also bipolar, which led to mood swings. The main issue here is about getting married and having a family. C initially thought the author would propose, but when that didn't happen, she became aggressive about it. Eventually, she gave up but they remained sexually active without using condoms. C had PCOS, which made her less likely to conceive, but she became pregnant. The author found out and convinced C to get an abortion. However, when they were about to leave for the procedure, C's cat got run over, and she and her grandparents interpreted this as a sign from God to keep the baby. The author then broke up with her and refused to take part in the child's life, only providing child support. Now the child is 5, and the author is conflicted after hearing the child say \"my daddy doesn't play with me.\"\n\nThe author is asking if he's in the wrong (AITA). The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, let me consider the legal and ethical aspects. In most places, a man is not legally obligated to provide emotional support, but he is for financial support (child support). Legally, the author is fulfilling his duty by paying child support. However, ethically, it's more complex. The author claims that C was selfish for tricking him into fatherhood, but he also contributed by not using protection. C was on birth control, but maybe that failed? The author admits he didn't use condoms, which could have increased the risk. So, some responsibility lies with both parties.\n\nThe key event is the abortion decision. The author tried to convince C to have an abortion, which is a major decision. However, when the opportunity arose, C changed her mind due to a perceived \"miracle\" (the cat's death). The author then ended the relationship. Is it fair to break up over her changing her mind? Well, if he was against the pregnancy from the start, maybe, but he did try to convince her to get the abortion and then backed out when she changed her decision. \n\nNow, the author refuses to be part of the child's life. From a moral standpoint, many would argue that a child has a right to know their father, even if the circumstances are difficult. The author is avoiding his parental responsibilities beyond financial support. The child's comment about not playing with his dad might lead to emotional harm, which the author is aware of but still chooses to stay distant. \n\nThe author's argument is that C was disrespectful by deceiving him and that he never wanted a child. But C was trying to fulfill her own desires, perhaps due to her personal history and mental health. The author's parents stepping in to take care of the child might be a good thing, but the author's refusal to engage could be seen as selfish now. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of the author's actions leading up to the pregnancy. By not using protection, he took a risk. C was on birth control, but no method is 100% effective. The decision to not use condoms was his choice, so he shares some responsibility. \n\nThe author may feel wronged because he wasn't ready for a child and C went against his wishes. However, once the child is born, the father has responsibilities. The author's stance is that he's firm in his decision, but the child's well-being is at stake. \n\nIn many cultures, the expectation is that a father would be involved in the child's life, regardless of the circumstances. The author's actions might be seen as neglectful, even if he's providing financially. The guilt he feels after hearing the child's comment suggests internal conflict, but he's still not willing to change his stance. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author may have some valid points about feeling pressured into a situation he wasn't ready for, once the child is born, his responsibility as a father extends beyond financial support. His refusal to engage with the child, despite the potential emotional impact, could be seen as him being in the wrong. The fact that he's aware of the child's feelings and still chooses to distance himself strengthens the argument that he's at fault.\n"
