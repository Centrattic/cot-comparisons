C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author was in a 3-year high school relationship with a girl named C. She had a tough upbringing and mental health issues (bipolar disorder). She wanted marriage and kids, but he wasn't interested. They had unprotected sex, she had PCOS which made pregnancy less likely, but she got pregnant anyway. He wanted an abortion, she agreed, but then when they were about to go get it, the cat died, and she changed her mind, claiming it was a miracle. He broke up with her, stopped being involved, only paying child support. Now he's feeling some guilt but still stands by his decision because he wasn't ready and felt she was selfish. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, to evaluate this, I need to look at both sides. From the author's perspective, he wasn't ready for a child, didn't want to be a parent, and felt that C tricked him into a pregnancy by hiding it and then changing her mind. He felt it was a violation of his autonomy. On the other hand, C had a history of mental health issues, which might have affected her decision-making. She might have felt pressured or not in control of her situation, especially with her family's religious influence. The author abandoned the child, which is a significant responsibility, and now the child is growing up without a father. The mother's actions, including the deception and the religious justification, are problematic, but the author's response is also extreme.\n\nLegally, he's responsible as a parent, so he should be involved. Emotionally, the child needs both parents if possible. The author's reasoning that he wasn't ready might be valid, but cutting off completely without any contact might not be fair to the child. The fact that he hasn't seen his son in years and only pays child support could be seen as neglectful. The mother's actions were definitely not ideal, but the author's reaction might be equally harmful to the child.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between personal choice and responsibility. The author had a right to his decision, but once a child is born, the responsibility extends beyond personal choice. The mother's deception is bad, but the father's withdrawal is also damaging. The child's well-being is a key factor here. The author's guilt and the mother's actions complicate things. It's a tough call, but generally, maintaining some level of contact with a child is considered important for their development. So, the author might be in the wrong for not engaging with his child despite his past issues with the mother. However, given the circumstances, maybe there's some nuance. I think the answer leans towards A (he is in the wrong) because of the responsibility towards the child, even if the mother was at fault in some ways.\n"
