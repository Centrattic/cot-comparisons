C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the author met a girl, C, in high school. She had a tough upbringing\u2014her father abandoned her and her mother committed suicide. Her grandparents are devout Catholics, and she became religious. C has bipolar disorder, which he didn't know about at first and it was causing mood swings. They were in a 3-year relationship, and C wanted to get married and have a family. The author didn't seem interested in proposing, so C started panicking and arguing. Eventually, C gave up but they stayed sexually active. The author mentions they used oral contraceptives and no condoms, so maybe he was aware of the risk but thought it was covered. Then C was diagnosed with PCOS, which made conception less likely, but she still ended up pregnant. \n\nThe author found out later and asked for an abortion, giving her an ultimatum. C was convinced at first, started planning to go to Melbourne, but on the morning of the flight, her cat got hit by the car and died. They saw this as a sign from God to keep the baby. So she didn't have the abortion, and the author broke up with her. Now the child is 5, and the author hasn't really interacted with him, only through child support. He feels guilty but still stands by his decision, thinking C was selfish for deceiving him to fulfill her fantasy.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From the story, the author didn't want a child, and C wanted one. He tried to convince her to have an abortion, but then she changed her mind after the cat incident. The author then broke up and hasn't involved himself further. People around him think he's wrong for abandoning the child. The author feels guilty but also believes he was wronged because he wasn't ready and she knew that. \n\nI need to consider ethical viewpoints here. Legally, if the author is the biological father, he might be responsible for child support, which he does. However, in terms of moral responsibility, once a child is born, the parent has a duty to the child regardless of the circumstances leading to the pregnancy. The author's decision to not be involved could be seen as neglectful, especially since the child is now 5 and starts to say things like \"my daddy doesn't play with me.\" \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that C was manipulative by hiding the pregnancy and not going through with the abortion. But the fact that she changed her mind after the cat incident doesn't necessarily mean she was being selfish. She might have had a change of heart or felt a divine intervention. However, the author's refusal to engage with the child now could be seen as a way to punish C, which might be unfair to the child. \n\nThe key points here are: the author's lack of consent, the deception by C, the subsequent breakup, and the ongoing disengagement from the child. While the author might not be the one who initially wanted the pregnancy, once the child is born, there's a moral obligation to be part of the child's life. The author's actions could be impacting the child's well-being. Even if C's actions were questionable, the child is innocent. So, the author might be in the wrong by not fulfilling his parental responsibilities. \n\nBut wait, the author was given an ultimatum and C chose to keep the baby against his wishes. He might have felt like he couldn't be a father under those circumstances. However, cutting off contact entirely after the child is born might still be considered morally wrong. People usually expect some level of parental involvement, even if the child is not their choice. The author's stance is firm, but the child's need for a father figure is significant. \n\nIn many cultures, a father's role is important, and denying that role could have long-term effects. The author might be in the wrong because he prioritized his own feelings over the child's needs. Even if he wasn't ready, once the child is born, maybe he should have worked towards being involved. \n\nSo, considering all these aspects, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). The deception and manipulation by C are problematic, but the author's refusal to engage with the child is also a moral failing. There's a responsibility to the child once he's born, regardless of the initial circumstances.\n"
