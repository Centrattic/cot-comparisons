C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author had a three-year relationship in high school with a girl named C. C had a tough upbringing and developed bipolar disorder, which caused mood swings. She wanted to get married and have a family, but the author wasn't interested in proposing. They were sexually active without using condoms, and C was on birth control. Then she was diagnosed with PCOS, making pregnancy harder, which stressed her out more.\n\nLater, she got pregnant without telling him. When he found out, he convinced her to get an abortion, but on the day they were going to the airport, her cat was hit by the car. She and her grandparents saw this as a sign from God to keep the baby. So she changed her mind and had the baby. The author broke up with her, hasn't been involved in the child's life, and pays child support. Now the child is 5 and says his dad doesn't play with him, making the author feel guilty but still stand his ground.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author didn't want to have a child and was pressured by C. He felt she was being selfish by hiding the pregnancy and using the cat incident as a sign. He had no say in the matter, which he sees as disrespectful. He's paying child support but hasn't been involved, which some might see as neglectful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author made a choice to break up and not be part of the child's life. Even though he had valid reasons, children have a right to a relationship with both parents. His decision might be seen as selfish now, especially since the child is expressing a desire for a father figure. Also, C's mental health and the circumstances might have contributed to the situation, but that doesn't absolve the author of his responsibility.\n\nLegally, he's required to support the child, but emotionally and ethically, being absent can affect the child's well-being. The author's refusal to engage despite the child's needs could be seen as wrong, even if he's not the one who wanted the child. His parents and others judge him for abandoning the child, which adds societal pressure.\n\nHowever, the author feels wronged because he wasn't ready and believed C was manipulative. His stance is that she was selfish, and he's holding onto that. But the child's current situation might require him to reconsider. The line between his right to make decisions about parenthood and the child's right to a father is blurry here.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, parental rights and responsibilities are complex. Once a child is born, legal obligations exist regardless of the circumstances. While the author didn't want the child initially, once the child exists, there are ethical and legal duties to consider. His continued disengagement could be seen as neglecting those duties.\n\nSo, balancing his initial reasons with the child's current needs, it's likely that the author is in the wrong (A) because he's choosing to remain absent despite the child's well-being. However, some might argue that he was forced into a situation he didn't consent to, but that doesn't negate his ongoing responsibilities.\n"
