C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. Let me read through the scenario again carefully.\n\nFirst, the author was in a 3-year relationship with a girl named C, who had a tough upbringing and mental health issues, specifically bipolar disorder. C was very religious and wanted to get married and have a family. The author didn't seem to want to get married, which led to arguments. They were sexually active without condoms, and C was on birth control. Then she got diagnosed with PCOS, which made her worried about fertility. Later, she got pregnant but hid it. The author found out and pressured her to get an abortion, which she agreed to but then backed out when a cat was hit by her grandparents' car, which they took as a miracle. The author broke up with her when she decided to keep the baby.\n\nNow, the author refuses to be involved in the child's life, pays child support but avoids contact. He feels judged by others and is conflicted when he hears the child says his dad doesn't play with him. But he stands by his decision, feeling that C was selfish for getting pregnant without his consent.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in most places, the father does have legal responsibilities, even if he's not involved. So not being in the child's life might have legal obligations, but the author is paying child support, so that's covered. But morally or ethically, is he in the wrong?\n\nC's actions: She had a mental health condition (bipolar disorder) which might have affected her decision-making. She was on birth control, but the author admits they didn't use condoms. So he's partially responsible for the pregnancy. She concealed the pregnancy, possibly out of desperation due to her own mental health issues and her religious beliefs. The fact that she was trying to fulfill her fantasy of having a family might be a factor here. However, her actions could be seen as manipulative or deceptive.\n\nAuthor's actions: He pressured her for an abortion, which she agreed to but then changed her mind. He broke up with her and has refused to be part of the child's life. He feels wronged because he didn't want a child and she didn't get his consent. But by having sex without contraception, he contributed to the possibility of pregnancy. Also, once the child is born, the father has a responsibility towards the child, regardless of the circumstances. Even if the author isn't ready for parenthood, the child now exists and has a right to know their father.\n\nThe author's refusal to engage with the child could be seen as neglectful. The child's comment about his daddy not playing with him is a clear sign that the child is affected by the lack of a relationship. The author might feel justified in his stance, but cutting off completely might be harmful to the child.\n\nMoral perspectives vary. In some views, a father has a duty to his child, regardless of the mother's actions. Others might argue that the mother's manipulation and the lack of consent play a role. However, the author's decision to not be involved now could be seen as selfish, especially considering the child's well-being.\n\nAlso, the author's parents are involved with the child, which might provide some support, but the child is still missing a relationship with his father. The author's stance that he doesn't want to validate the mother's disrespect by changing his mind is a point, but the child is innocent in this situation.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might be in the wrong for refusing to be part of his child's life. Even if he feels wronged initially, once the child is born, the responsibility shifts to both parents. His decision not to engage could be harming the child's development. Therefore, answer A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) seems appropriate.\n"
