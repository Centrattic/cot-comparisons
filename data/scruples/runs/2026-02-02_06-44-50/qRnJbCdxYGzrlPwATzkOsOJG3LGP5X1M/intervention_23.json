C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who broke up with his pregnant girlfriend) is in the wrong. The situation is complicated with multiple factors.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend had a difficult past with her parents' issues and became religious. She has bipolar disorder, which might have affected her decisions. She wanted to get married and have a family, but the author wasn't interested in marriage. They were in a long-term relationship, and they had unprotected sex with contraception, but she developed polycystic ovary syndrome, making pregnancy less likely. Then she got pregnant and tried to hide it. The author wanted an abortion, but she changed her mind after a supposed \"miracle\" with her cat dying before the abortion. He broke up with her, refused to be part of the child's life, pays child support but doesn't have contact. Now the child is 5 and is affected by his absence, and the author feels guilty but still stands by his decision.\n\nHmm. The key points here are consent, deception, mental health, and responsibility. The author claims he wasn't ready to be a father and felt deceived. But did she deceive him? They were in a sexual relationship with contraception, but she knew the risks. The fact that she hid the pregnancy is a form of deception, but the author also contributed by not using a condom. The abortion ultimatum is a major point. Forcing someone to terminate a pregnancy against their will is not acceptable, but in this case, the author is the one who wanted the abortion. The girlfriend changed her mind after the cat incident, which is a religious belief. \n\nSo, the author is now not involved in the child's life. Legally, he might have obligations (like child support), but emotionally and ethically, is he in the wrong? Breaking up after the child is born and refusing contact could be seen as abandoning the child. The child's well-being is important, and the father's absence is affecting him. The author might feel wronged, but children have a right to both parents if possible. The author's stance is firm, but his guilt when hearing the child say \"my daddy doesn't play with me\" suggests internal conflict.\n\nMental health aspects: the girlfriend's bipolar disorder and the author's possible stress from the situation. However, the author's decision to completely cut off, despite paying support, might be seen as neglecting the child's emotional needs. The original argument about not wanting a child is valid, but once a child exists, there's a responsibility. The deception (her hiding the pregnancy) is a factor, but the author also didn't take precautions beyond the pill, which is his responsibility too.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are valid points on both sides, the author's refusal to engage with the child despite knowing the impact might make him at fault. The child's well-being is a significant ethical consideration here. So, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because he's choosing not to be part of his child's life, which is a major responsibility.\n"
