C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. Let's start by breaking down the details.\n\nFirst, the author and his girlfriend had a three-year relationship in high school. The girlfriend, C, comes from a troubled background with a history of mental health issues\u2014bipolar disorder. She was religious and wanted to have a family, but the author wasn't ready to get married or have kids. They were using birth control, but she developed PCOS, which made pregnancy less likely. Despite that, she got pregnant. The author discovered it, asked for an abortion, and convinced her to go through with it. However, on the day of the abortion, a cat was hit by the car they were using, which they interpreted as a \"miracle,\" so she decided to keep the baby. The author then broke up with her, refused to be involved, and hasn't had much contact with the child. Now, the child is five and mentions not having a dad, causing the author guilt but he still stands by his decision.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the author wasn't ready for a child, the girlfriend manipulated the situation by hiding the pregnancy, and the author feels wronged. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nLegally, in many places, the decision to terminate a pregnancy can be mutual or individual, depending on laws. But since the abortion was aborted (no pun intended) due to the cat incident, the author's refusal to be involved raises ethical questions. The girlfriend's actions\u2014deceiving him about the pregnancy, and then proceeding with the child against his wishes\u2014could be seen as selfish. However, the author's choice to not engage with his child is also questionable, especially since he's paying child support but not being a father.\n\nEthically, it's complex. The author had autonomy over his body in the beginning, but once the child is born, the responsibilities change. The author's stance that he wasn't ready and that the mother was selfish is his justification, but the child is a person with their own needs. The author's guilt and the child's feelings (like in the schoolyard comment) suggest that the author's decision has lasting negative effects.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's mental health and religious beliefs might have influenced her actions. She might have felt pressured by her family and her faith to keep the child. However, she still made the choice to deceive the author and proceed without his consent after he was against having a child.\n\nThe key issue here is consent and mutual agreement. The author didn't want children, and she proceeded without his consent, which is a violation of his autonomy. However, once the child exists, the author's refusal to be involved despite providing financial support might be seen as neglect. There's a balance between personal autonomy and responsibility towards a child.\n\nIn many moral frameworks, the author's initial decision to not have a child is valid if he communicated it, but the mother's decision to proceed without his agreement complicates things. However, the author's continued disengagement from the child's life, despite the child's need for a father figure, suggests that the author is in the wrong now. The child's well-being is a factor here, and the author's choice to not be involved is harming the child's emotional development.\n\nSo, considering all angles, while the author had valid reasons at the time, the current situation where he's not engaging with his child makes him ethically in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
