C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he broke up with his pregnant girlfriend after she had an opportunity to get an abortion but changed her mind when her cat was run over, which she saw as a sign from God. Now he's paying child support but not involved in the child's life, and he's feeling guilt but also stands by his decision.\n\nFirst, the key points here are consent and responsibility. The author claims he wasn't ready for a child and that his girlfriend, C, was being selfish by getting pregnant without his consent. But wait, they were in a sexual relationship and he didn't use a condom. So, even if they weren't using protection, he's sharing responsibility for the possibility of pregnancy. He might argue that he didn't expect her to get pregnant despite the birth control, but the fact remains that both parties are responsible for contraception.\n\nC's actions here are a bit complex. She had a history of mental health issues, which might affect her decision-making. She was under a lot of pressure from her beliefs and her desire to have a family. The abortion was scheduled, but she changed her mind after the cat incident. That seems like a sudden shift, but maybe her mental state made her susceptible to such influences. However, she did initially agree to the abortion, so her change of heart might not be entirely his fault. But he had to deal with the consequences of her decision.\n\nNow, the author broke up with her because of this. He claims she was being selfish, but he also didn't want a child. However, once the child was born, he's responsible as a parent. Not engaging with the child, even while paying support, raises ethical questions. He's choosing to distance himself, which could harm the child's well-being. The child's comment about the father not playing with him shows the emotional impact of his absence.\n\nBut the author feels wronged because he wasn't ready and felt tricked. However, he can't entirely blame the mother for his own lack of readiness. He had the chance to prevent pregnancy by using protection, and once the child exists, he has a responsibility. His decision to cut off contact, while his parents are involved, complicates things. While he might feel justified in his stance, society often expects parents to take responsibility, regardless of circumstances.\n\nSo, weighing both sides: he shares responsibility for the pregnancy, and his refusal to be involved in the child's life is harmful. Even if he's not the ideal parent, the child has a right to a relationship with both parents if possible. The author's guilt and the child's well-being suggest that he's in the wrong by not taking that responsibility. So, answer A.\n"
