C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author broke up with his pregnant girlfriend, C, five years ago. C had a difficult past: her father abandoned her, her mother committed suicide, and her grandparents are devout Catholics. She has bipolar disorder, which caused erratic behavior. They were in a high school relationship, and C wanted to get married and have a family, but the author wasn't interested. They had unprotected sex (he admits it was his fault), and when C got pregnant, he convinced her to get an abortion. But on the way to the abortion, her cat was run over, which they saw as a miracle, so she decided to keep the child. The author then broke up with her. Now, the child is 5, and the author hasn't been involved, only paying child support. He feels guilty when he hears his son say he doesn't play with him. Others think he's wrong for not being part of the child's life.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the ethical and legal aspects here. Legally, in most places, a father has rights and responsibilities regarding his child. The author is paying child support, which is legally required, but he's avoiding contact. This could be seen as neglecting his parental duties beyond financial support. While the situation with the abortion and the cat incident complicates things, once the child is born, the father has a responsibility.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author's refusal to engage with his child raises questions about his moral responsibility. Even if the pregnancy was unplanned and the mother made decisions without his consent, becoming a parent brings responsibilities that extend beyond the initial circumstances. The child's well-being is a key factor here. The comment from the son saying he doesn't play with his dad suggests emotional harm, which could affect the child's development.\n\nThe author argues that he wasn't ready for a child and that C was being selfish by getting pregnant. However, by choosing to keep the child, C fulfilled her desire to have a family, but the author is now facing the consequences of his decision not to be involved. It's a complex situation where both parties made decisions that impacted the other. The author's stance on not changing his mind might be based on past resentment, but it's affecting his child's life negatively.\n\nConsidering the arguments, while the author might have valid reasons for his initial decision, withholding involvement in his child's life beyond financial support is generally seen as harmful. Society values parental presence and emotional bonding. The author's judgment that C was disrespectful might justify his breakup, but it doesn't absolve him of his responsibilities as a father. The key issue is the ongoing refusal to engage with his child, which is where his current \"wrongdoing\" lies. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not taking responsibility for his child's upbringing despite the circumstances.\n"
