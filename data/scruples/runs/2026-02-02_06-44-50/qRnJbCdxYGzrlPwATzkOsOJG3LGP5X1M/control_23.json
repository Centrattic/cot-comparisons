C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend, C, after she secretly got pregnant and then decided to keep the baby after a near-miss abortion. \n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author mentions that C had a traumatic past and mental health issues, which might have influenced her actions. She wanted to have a family but he wasn't ready to get married or have kids. He says she was deceptive, hiding the pregnancy until it was too late for an abortion, and then changed her mind after a \"miracle\" with the cat. He felt forced into a situation he wasn't prepared for and broke up with her, not getting involved with the child. Now he's feeling guilty but still stands by his decision.\n\nOn the other hand, by law in many places, both parents have responsibilities towards their child regardless of the circumstances. The author is paying child support but not involved in the child's life. People around him think he's being selfish now. The child is already affected by his absence, and the author is resisting changing his stance, even though he feels some guilt. \n\nFrom a legal perspective, he's doing his duty with child support, but emotionally and morally, there's a conflict. The mother's actions were arguably manipulative, but once the child is born, the father has a role in the child's life. The author's refusal to engage could be seen as neglecting the child's needs, even if he wasn't ready for parenthood. \n\nThe key points: C's mental health and manipulation might explain her actions, but the author's decision to cut off contact after the child's birth affects the child's well-being. Society and his family see this as wrong because children deserve a relationship with both parents if possible. The author's stance now could be harming the child, so even though he had reasons to break up, his current actions might be considered in the wrong.\n"
