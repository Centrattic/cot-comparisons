C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author broke up with his pregnant girlfriend, C, five years ago. They were in a high school relationship that lasted three years. C had a tough upbringing\u2014her father abandoned her, her mother committed suicide, and her grandparents, who are devout Catholics, raised her. C has bipolar disorder, which wasn't obvious at first. She wanted to get married and have a family, but the author wasn't interested in marriage. They had a sexual relationship without condoms, using oral contraceptives. C was diagnosed with PCOS, which made her fear infertility. Then she got pregnant, hid it, and the author convinced her to get an abortion. But on the day they were going to the airport, her cat was hit by the car, and the family saw it as a sign from God not to have the abortion. C decided to keep the baby, and the author broke up with her. He hasn't been involved with the child, pays child support, but now feels guilty when hearing the child says his dad doesn't play with him. The author feels wronged because C was selfish, and he wasn't ready for a child. The question is whether he's in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and moral aspects. Legally, in many places, the father's rights aren't fully established until certain steps are taken, like being on the birth certificate or acknowledging paternity. But the author has been paying child support, so he's legally recognized as the father. However, breaking up the relationship and not being involved could have legal implications depending on the jurisdiction, but the question is more about moral responsibility.\n\nMoral considerations: The author had a sexual relationship, didn't use condoms, and C was on birth control. But even with birth control, there's a small chance of pregnancy. The author's responsibility here is a key point. By engaging in unprotected sex, he contributed to the risk of pregnancy. C's decision to hide her pregnancy and then go through with it, especially after the author insisted on abortion, might be seen as manipulation. However, once the pregnancy is known, the author can't force an abortion. The mother's right to decide about her body is a significant factor here. The author's anger at being \"trapped\" into a parenthood he didn't want might be seen as selfish, as parenthood is a shared responsibility once a child is born.\n\nC's mental health history\u2014bipolar disorder and the trauma from her upbringing\u2014might affect her decision-making. But the author also has a role in the situation. He didn't use condoms, and C was on birth control, which he trusted. However, when the pregnancy occurred despite that, the author's response was to pressure for an abortion, which C initially agreed to but then changed her mind. The cat incident, interpreted as a divine sign, might be seen as a catalyst for C's decision. The author's subsequent breakup and refusal to be involved in the child's life could be viewed as abandoning the child, which is a serious issue. The child's well-being is a concern, and the author's guilt at the child's comment suggests he's aware of the emotional impact.\n\nOn the other hand, the author argues that C was deceptive and selfish. He wasn't ready for a child, and the situation was forced on him. But once the child was born, cutting off contact entirely might be considered neglectful. The author's stance is that he won't validate C's \"disrespect\" by changing his mind, which implies that he holds a grudge against C for her actions, but this grudge affects the child's life and development. The child deserves a relationship with both parents, even if there's conflict between the parents.\n\nIn terms of societal views, many would argue that the father has a responsibility to his child regardless of the circumstances. The mother's actions were indeed problematic, but the father can't unilaterally decide to walk away. The author's decision not to be involved despite paying child support might be seen as a way to fulfill legal obligations without emotional involvement, which is still harmful to the child.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions\u2014breaking up, not participating in the child's life, and being influenced by a grudge\u2014could be considered morally wrong. Even if C was manipulative and the situation is complex, the child's needs should take precedence. The author's responsibility as a parent doesn't end with the breakup. Therefore, the answer is A: the author is in the wrong.\n"
