C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his ex-girlfriend who became pregnant, leading to a breakup and him not being involved with the child. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author was in a relationship with C, who had a traumatic past and bipolar disorder. They were sexually active with contraception, but C's contraceptive failed due to PCOS. She hid the pregnancy, then the author pressured her for an abortion, which she initially agreed to but then changed her mind when her cat died, which her family saw as a sign from God. The author broke up with her, refuses contact with the child, and pays child support. Now he's feeling guilt but remains firm in his decision.\n\nSo, the key points here are about consent, responsibility, and moral judgments. The author argues that he wasn't ready for a child and that C deceived him, which he finds disrespectful. On the other hand, the ex's actions involved hiding the pregnancy and then backing out of the abortion, possibly due to religious beliefs. The author's refusal to engage with the child raises questions about parental responsibility, even if he's not the legal parent.\n\nLegally, in many places, the biological father's rights can be terminated if he disclaims paternity, but since he's paying child support, he might still have some legal obligations. However, the ethical side is more complex. While the author wasn't ready for a child and felt deceived, once the child exists, the father's responsibility is often considered a societal expectation. The author's continued non-involvement might be seen as neglectful, even if he wasn't a willing parent.\n\nThe user's perspective is that C was selfish, but so is the author now for not supporting his child. Both actions stem from conflicting values: autonomy versus responsibility. The author's guilt over the child's feelings (\"my daddy doesn't play with me\") suggests inner conflict. \n\nIn terms of moral judgment, many would argue that while the author's initial decision was made under pressure and deception, his ongoing disengagement is harmful to the child. The child's well-being is paramount, and cutting off contact might be seen as inconsiderate. The author's argument about C's disrespect is valid, but it doesn't negate the child's right to a relationship with their father. \n\nSo, balancing both sides, the author's actions in breaking up and then refusing contact could be seen as morally questionable because he's impacting the child's life negatively. Even if he wasn't ready, once the child exists, the father's role is often considered important. Therefore, the answer is A\u2014the author is in the wrong.\n"
