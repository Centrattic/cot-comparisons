C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is a guy who was in a 3-year relationship with a girl named C. C had a tough upbringing, her parents weren't around much, and she's religious and has bipolar disorder. She wanted to get married and have a family, but the author wasn't interested in marriage. They were sexually active, using condoms wasn't a thing, and she was on birth control. Then she got diagnosed with PCOS, which made her worried about fertility. Then she got pregnant, hid it, and when confronted, denied it. The author wanted an abortion, and she agreed to go to Melbourne for it. But when they were about to leave, the cat got hit by the car, and she saw it as a sign from God to keep the baby. The author broke up with her after that. Now the child is 5, and the author isn't involved, even though he pays child support. People are judging him, and now he's hearing the kid says his daddy doesn't play with him, making him feel guilty but still sticking to his decision.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong? The user thinks he is, but I need to think it through.\n\nFrom the author's perspective: He felt forced into parenthood. He wasn't ready, and the pregnancy was a result of what he sees as deception. He didn't want a child, and she went against his wishes by carrying the baby to term. He might feel that his autonomy was violated.\n\nFrom C's side: She was struggling with mental health, had a traumatic past, and her desire to have a family was strong. Hiding the pregnancy and using the cat incident as a sign could be seen as manipulative, but she might have been acting out of desperation and her mental health issues.\n\nLegally, the father still has responsibilities even if the child wasn't his intention. The author is paying child support, so that's a good point. But emotionally and ethically, is he wrong to cut off contact? Children need both parents, and his absence is affecting the kid. Also, the author's argument that he wasn't given a say might not hold up because once a child is born, parental responsibility is a legal and moral obligation regardless of the circumstances of the birth.\n\nBut there's the issue of consent. Did he consent to the pregnancy? He wanted an abortion, but she decided otherwise. However, in many places, the decision to terminate is the woman's, so once she refused, his options were limited. The author might feel like he lost control, but that's part of the reality of unintended pregnancies.\n\nHis current stance of not engaging with the child is causing emotional harm. Even if he resents the situation, the child's well-being is important. His parents are involved, but it's still missing a father figure. The comment from the kid about not playing with him is a clear sign that the absence is affecting the child.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's initial reaction was to push for an abortion, which he felt was the solution. But once that wasn't an option, he cut ties. His parents are helping, but that might not substitute for the father's presence.\n\nIs the author's decision justified? Arguably, he's being selfish now by not engaging. Even if the circumstances were unfair, the child is a separate person with needs. The author's lack of contact could be seen as neglectful, regardless of his reasons.\n\nSo considering all that, I think the author is in the wrong now. While the situation is complex, once the child exists, the father has a responsibility. The guilt he feels might be valid, but his actions continue to harm the child. So answer A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
