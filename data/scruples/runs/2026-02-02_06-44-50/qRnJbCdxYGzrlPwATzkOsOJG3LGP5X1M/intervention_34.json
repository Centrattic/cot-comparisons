C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me break down the situation. \n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with a girl named C, who had a tough past. She lost her dad and her mom, and her grandparents are strict Catholics. She has bipolar disorder, which made her moods erratic. The author and C were in a three-year relationship in high school, and even though C wanted marriage and kids, the author wasn't into it. They had sexual relations without protection, leading to C getting pregnant. But she had PCOS, which made pregnancy less likely. \n\nThen, she got pregnant despite that. The author found out and wanted an abortion, giving her an ultimatum. They went to book a flight to Melbourne for the procedure, but C had a change of heart after her cat was hit by the car, which she and her family saw as a miracle. She decided to keep the baby, and the author broke up with her. Now the kid is five, and the author hasn't been involved, only paying child support. People judge him for not being part of the child's life, and he feels guilty when the kid says his dad doesn't play with him.\n\nThe author claims he wasn't ready for a child and feels C was selfish for tricking him. He's firm in his decision not to change his mind. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author didn't want the child and tried to get an abortion. C hid the pregnancy and then changed her mind due to religious reasons. He didn't want to be a father, which is his right. On the other hand, he's a parent now, and the child has a right to know and have a relationship with the father. The author is cutting off contact, which could harm the child's well-being. Also, he's paying child support, which is legal, but emotional involvement is important for the child.\n\nBut was he wrong in breaking up? Well, he had the right to end the relationship if he wasn't ready for a child. However, once the child was born, he has responsibilities. The fact that he's not involved could be seen as neglectful. Also, C's deception might be a factor, but that doesn't absolve him of his parental duties. The author's stance is that C was selfish for tricking him, but he's also choosing to not engage with his son, which could be seen as selfish now. \n\nThe key points here are the legal and moral responsibilities of parenthood. Even if the author didn't want the child, once the child is born, he has a duty to provide emotional support. Avoiding contact might be harmful. Also, the author's refusal to change his mind despite the child's needs could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, I think the author is in the wrong because he's choosing to disengage from his child's life, even though he has a responsibility to be there. C's actions were problematic, but that doesn't negate his obligations as a father. The child's well-being should be a priority, and the author's current stance is harming the child's emotional development. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
