C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author had a girlfriend who had a tough past, including her parents' issues and her bipolar disorder. The girlfriend wanted to get married and have kids, but the author wasn't into it. They ended up having a sexual relationship without using condoms, and she was on birth control. Then she got diagnosed with PCOS, which made her fear infertility. But later, she got pregnant and hid it. The author wanted an abortion and gave her an ultimatum: him or the baby. She agreed, but then when they were about to go for the abortion, the cat got run over, and she took that as a sign from God to keep the baby. The author then broke up with her and hasn't been involved, only paying child support. Now, the child is 5 and the author feels some guilt but still stands by his decision.\n\nFirst, let's look at the author's perspective. He claims he wasn't ready for a child, that the girlfriend deceived him by hiding the pregnancy and using the cat incident as a divine sign. He feels she was selfish for going against his wishes. But from an ethical standpoint, a child is involved now. The author is the biological father, and in many societies, there's an expectation that fathers take responsibility for their children. Even if he didn't want the child, cutting off contact entirely might be seen as neglectful. Also, the child has a right to know their father, and the author's absence is affecting the child emotionally.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's actions could be seen as manipulative. She might have used the ultimatum and the religious interpretation of the cat's death to force the author into a situation he wasn't comfortable with. However, once the child is born, the author's responsibilities don't just end. The fact that he pays child support shows he acknowledges some responsibility financially, but emotionally and parentally he's absent. That could be seen as abandoning the child, which is a serious matter.\n\nLaws often require parental involvement and financial support, but moral responsibility is separate. The author's refusal to engage with his child, despite the mother's actions, could be viewed as selfish too. The child's well-being is at stake here. Even if the mother was wrong in how she handled the pregnancy, the father now has a duty to his child. The child's statement that the father doesn't play with him indicates a lack of relationship, which is harmful.\n\nThe author might feel wronged because he wasn't ready and felt tricked, but once the child is born, the situation changes. The author's decision to remain absent could be considered wrong because it's the child who's suffering the most. The mother's actions were indeed problematic, but the father's ongoing disengagement is also a problem. So, balancing both sides, it seems like the author is in the wrong now, even if the mother made mistakes. The child deserves a relationship with both parents if possible, and the author's refusal to be part of the child's life is harmful.\n"
