C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is complex.\n\nFirst, the author broke up with his pregnant girlfriend after she refused to have an abortion. The girl had a history of mental health issues, including bipolar disorder, and was raised in a strict religious environment. She was taking birth control but became pregnant, then decided to keep the child after a \"miracle\" with her cat. The author feels wronged because he wasn't ready for a child and she deceived him. However, he's also been judged for not being involved in the child's life.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The woman did hide the pregnancy and then changed her mind about the abortion. But the author is now the father, and cutting off contact with his child could be seen as neglectful. Legally, he's paying child support, which is a responsibility, but emotional involvement is different. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author's decision to break up and not participate in the child's life might be seen as selfish now. Even if he wasn't ready, the child exists, and he's their parent. The mother's actions were deceitful, but the father has a responsibility too. The guilt mentioned by the author when the child says he doesn't play with him adds to the complexity. \n\nOn the other hand, the author wasn't informed about the pregnancy and was given an ultimatum. The mother's mental health and manipulation factors in might be significant. But the author's stance that he never wants to be a father and won't change his mind could be seen as neglecting the child's needs. \n\nSociety often expects parents to be involved regardless of circumstances. Even if the pregnancy was unwanted, the child has a right to both parents. The author's refusal to engage, despite knowing the child is starting school, might be in the wrong. However, there's also the aspect of the mother's deception and the author's initial stance that he wasn't ready. \n\nBalancing these factors, it seems like the author is in the wrong because he's choosing not to be part of his child's life, which affects the child negatively. The mother's actions were wrong, but the father's decision to disengage is also problematic. So, the answer is A.\n"
