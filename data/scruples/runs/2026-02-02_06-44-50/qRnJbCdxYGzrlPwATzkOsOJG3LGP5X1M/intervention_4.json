C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. The situation is pretty complicated, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the author was in a high school relationship with a girl who had a tough upbringing and mental health issues\u2014bipolar disorder. She wanted to get married and have a family, but the author wasn't interested in marriage. They were sexually active, using birth control, but she developed PCOS, which made pregnancy harder. Despite that, she got pregnant. The author found out and convinced her to get an abortion, but then the cat incident happened, leading her to believe it was a sign to keep the baby. The author then broke up with her, didn't take part in the child's life, and only pays child support. Now he's feeling guilt when the child mentions not having a dad, but he still maintains he was wronged.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the author and girlfriend not on the same page about family plans, the girlfriend's mental health and manipulation (deceiving others to fulfill her fantasy), the author's decision to end the relationship, and his current stance on not being part of the child's life.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. The answer choices are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author didn't want to be a parent and felt pressured. The girlfriend's actions could be seen as selfish, hiding the pregnancy, and manipulating the situation after the abortion was scheduled. The author might feel he was forced into an unwanted situation. On the other hand, once the child is born, the author has responsibilities as a parent. Abandoning the child might be seen as neglectful, even if the initial pregnancy was a result of the girlfriend's decisions. Also, the author is paying child support, which is legally required, but not being involved in the child's life could be emotionally harmful.\n\nLegally, in many places, both parents have rights and responsibilities. Emotionally, the child deserves a relationship with both parents if possible. The author's decision to cut off contact might be causing harm to the child. The girlfriend's past doesn't absolve her of her actions, but the author's current stance might be hurting the child regardless of the circumstances.\n\nThere's also the question of consent and responsibility. The author was involved in the sexual activity without using condoms, which contributed to the pregnancy. Even if he didn't want children, he shares responsibility. The girlfriend's mental health and manipulation are factors, but the author could argue he wasn't aware of the extent of her mental state at the time. However, he knew she had a strong desire for children and was being aggressive about it, so maybe he should have taken more precautions.\n\nIn terms of ethics, while the girlfriend made decisions without his consent, the author is now responsible for the child. Choosing not to be part of the child's life could be seen as selfish, even if he didn't want the child initially. The child's well-being is a factor here. The author's guilt when hearing the child talk about not having a dad suggests he knows there's some truth to the criticism from others.\n\nSo, considering all that, even if the author feels wronged, once a child is born, the responsibilities extend beyond just legal obligations. The child's emotional needs are important. The author's firm stance might not be in the child's best interest, even if he's justified in his initial decision to break up. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not engaging with his child and maintaining a relationship, despite the circumstances of the pregnancy.\n\nBut wait, there's also the aspect of the girlfriend's manipulation. She hid the pregnancy and then, after agreeing to an abortion, changed her mind after the cat incident. That could be seen as a breach of the agreement, making the author feel betrayed. However, the author's response was to break up and not engage, which might be a valid reaction to feeling used. But again, the child's needs now are separate from the parents' issues.\n\nIt's a tough call. The author's actions have consequences for the child. Even if he feels wronged, the child has a right to a relationship with both parents. So, maybe the answer is A\u2014yes, the author is in the wrong because he's not fulfilling his parental responsibilities beyond just financial support, which is necessary but not sufficient for a healthy child's development.\n"
