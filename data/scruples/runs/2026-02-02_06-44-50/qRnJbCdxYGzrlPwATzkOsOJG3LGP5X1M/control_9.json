C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. So, first, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. \n\nThe author was in a 3-year relationship with C when they were in high school. C has a tough background: her father abandoned her, her mother committed suicide, and she was raised by devout Catholic grandparents. She's also got bipolar disorder, which led to some erratic behavior. She wanted to get married and have kids, but the author wasn't interested. They had unprotected sex, she got on birth control, but then developed PCOS, making pregnancy harder. Despite that, she ended up pregnant. The author made her an ultimatum: him or the baby. She agreed to an abortion but then backed out when her cat was hit by her car on the way to the airport, which her family interpreted as a miracle. The author broke up with her, hasn't been involved with the child, pays child support, but is now feeling guilty after hearing the child says his dad doesn't play with him.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author argues that C was selfish for getting pregnant when he wasn't ready and that she deceived him. But let's look at the facts. They were in a high school relationship, and the author wasn't interested in marriage or kids. C had mental health issues and a traumatic past. She was on birth control, but it failed. The author didn't use a condom, so he shares responsibility. The pregnancy was a result of their sexual activity. When she tried to get an abortion, he forced her to go through with it, then she changed her mind due to a religious belief triggered by an accident. The author then left her, which is a big deal because they now have a child together.\n\nLegally, the author is the father, so he has responsibilities. Even if he didn't want to be part of the child's life, he's still obligated by law to provide child support. Emotionally, the child is missing his father, which is causing guilt for the author. The author says he's not ready to be a father, but the child is already five. The question is whether his decision to break up and not engage with the child is wrong.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, while C's actions might have contributed\u2014maybe she wasn't truthful about her intentions or took advantage of the author's position\u2014the author also shares responsibility. The fact that he didn't use a condom despite her being on birth control shows he wasn't fully protecting against pregnancy. The ultimatum he gave her, forcing her to choose between him and the baby, is a heavy decision. Then, when she changed her mind, he walked away. Now the child is growing up without a father figure, which could have long-term emotional effects.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that C was selfish, but his own decision to cut off contact seems to be a refusal to accept responsibility for the child's upbringing. While he might feel wronged, as the biological father, he has a duty to be involved, regardless of his past feelings. His lack of contact is impacting the child's life, which is a significant ethical issue. So, even if there were a lot of factors leading to the pregnancy, once the child exists, the father has responsibilities. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not engaging with his child and not trying to rebuild a relationship despite the challenges.\n"
