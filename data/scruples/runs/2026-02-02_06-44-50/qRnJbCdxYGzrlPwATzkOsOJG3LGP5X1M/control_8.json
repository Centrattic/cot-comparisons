C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The scenario is about a breakup after a girlfriend got pregnant, then decided to keep the child after the author convinced her to get an abortion, but a \"miracle\" with the cat changed her mind.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The author was in a relationship with a girl who had a tough background and mental health issues (bipolar disorder). She wanted to get married and have a family, but he didn't. They were using birth control, but she developed PCOS, which made pregnancy less likely. She hid her pregnancy until it was too late for an abortion. The author pushed for an abortion, but she changed her mind after the cat died, seeing it as a sign from God. He broke up with her and hasn't been involved with the child, only paying child support. Now he's feeling guilty when he hears the child talks about him, but he stands by his decision.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, the law says he's responsible for child support, which he's doing. But morally, is he wrong for not being involved? The girlfriend had a history of mental health issues and might not have been in a stable state to make that decision. But by the time the pregnancy was known, it's unclear if her mental state was a factor in her changing her mind. Also, the author might feel pressured and not ready for parenthood. However, walking away completely from a child he fathered is a big deal. Even if he didn't want to be a parent, there's a responsibility there. Society often views parental involvement as important for the child's well-being. The fact that the child is missing his dad and the mother might be using the child to get at him adds complexity. The author's parents are involved, which is good, but he's not. So, morally, while his initial decisions might have been influenced by coercion or the girlfriend's actions, cutting off completely seems harsh. The girlfriend did deceive him by hiding the pregnancy, but once the child exists, the father has responsibilities beyond just financial. So, considering all angles, the author is likely in the wrong for not being involved in his child's life despite the circumstances.\n"
