C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nSo, the guy was in a high school relationship with a girl who had a tough upbringing, bipolar disorder, and was very religious. She wanted to get married and have a family, but he wasn't interested in marriage. They didn't use protection, she had PCOS but ended up getting pregnant. He tried to convince her to get an abortion, and she agreed, but then a \"miracle\" happened with the cat dying, which her grandparents took as a sign to keep the baby. The author then broke up with her and hasn't been involved in the child's life beyond child support.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but wants to know my take.\n\nFirst, let's consider the legal aspect. In many places, a man isn't legally obligated to be involved in a child's life if he doesn't want to be, but he is required to pay child support. However, the ethical side is different. The author didn't want a child, didn't use protection, and then when a child came about, he walked away. There's a sense of responsibility here. Even if he didn't want the child, the child exists, and the author is the father. Walking away completely might be seen as selfish by some, especially since the child is now growing up without a father figure.\n\nBut then, the woman did deceive him by hiding the pregnancy and manipulating the situation with the cat incident. That's a significant factor. She might have been acting out of her own desperation to have a family, compounded by her mental health issues. However, the author's role in not using protection and contributing to the pregnancy is also a point to consider.\n\nThe author's stance is that he wasn't ready for a child and that she was selfish. But by not being involved in his son's life, he's also denying the child a relationship with his father. The guilt he feels is mentioned, but he still stands by his decision. The key here might be the balance between personal choice and parental responsibility. The author has the right to not be a father, but once the child exists, there's an ongoing responsibility to care for the child's well-being, even if not in a direct parenting role. However, not being involved beyond financial support can be seen as neglectful from a societal and ethical standpoint.\n\nThe child, now 5, is asking about his dad, which shows the impact of the absence. The author might be harming the child's emotional development by not being present. Even if the initial pregnancy was mishandled, the child's needs now are real. The author's decision to cut ties completely might be more harmful than staying involved despite the conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's perspective is valid in that he wasn't consulted and felt manipulated. The woman's actions were indeed deceitful, and her mental health played a role. But the consequences of that manipulation are affecting a child. The author's refusal to engage might be his way of coping, but it's not the best for the child.\n\nSo, considering both sides, while the woman's actions were problematic, the author's decision to completely disengage from the child's life, despite providing support, might be seen as in the wrong because it's denying the child a relationship with his father. The author has a responsibility beyond just financial support. Therefore, the answer is A (author is in the wrong).\n"
