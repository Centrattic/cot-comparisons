C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is a guy who broke up with his pregnant girlfriend after she got an abortion but then changed her mind because a cat was run over. They had been together for three years in high school. The girl, C, has a tough background\u2014her dad left, her mom committed suicide, and she's raised by devout Catholic grandparents. She has bipolar disorder, which might have influenced her actions. The author mentions they didn't use condoms and she was on birth control, but she still got pregnant. When she found out she was pregnant with polycystic ovary syndrome, which makes pregnancy less likely, she was really into starting a family. \n\nThen, he convinced her to get an abortion, but they were going to the airport when the cat was hit. She and her grandparents saw this as a sign from God to keep the baby. The author broke up with her afterward and hasn't been involved, only paying child support. Now the kid is five and knows his dad isn't around, which is making the author feel guilty but he's holding firm in his decision.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author have the right to break up with her after she changed her mind about the abortion? Is it his responsibility to be involved in the child's life? Was he wrong to not get involved even though he's the father? \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he wasn't ready for a child and felt deceived because she hid the pregnancy. He had agreed to the abortion before she changed her mind. But once she decided to keep the child against his wishes, he felt he couldn't stay in the relationship and chose to distance himself. He's been paying child support, which is a legal obligation, but isn't engaging emotionally or spending time with the child. \n\nOn the other hand, the girl's actions involved deception by hiding the pregnancy and then changing her decision. However, once the child is born, the father has legal and moral responsibilities. The author is avoiding those by not being involved, which could be seen as neglectful. Even if the child was a result of a situation he didn't want, once the child exists, he's responsible. The fact that the child is now aware his dad isn't around and is being affected by it adds to the moral weight.\n\nLegally, the author is fulfilling part of his duty by paying child support, but emotionally and socially, he's cutting off contact. That's where the conflict is. People might argue that he's being selfish by not taking responsibility in a more active way. Even if he didn't want the child, he's still the father, and the child has a right to a relationship with both parents. The author's stance that she disrespected him by changing her mind and that he's not validating her by changing his mind now\u2014this seems like he's prioritizing his own feelings over the child's well-being.\n\nSo, considering all that, even though there were issues with the girl's actions, the author's decision to not engage with his child could be seen as wrong. He's choosing not to be part of the child's life, which affects the child's development and relationships. Guilt is also mentioned, suggesting he knows there's something morally off, but he's sticking to his decision. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
