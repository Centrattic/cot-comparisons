C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend under the given circumstances. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The author was in a 3-year relationship with C, who had a tough upbringing and mental health issues (bipolar disorder). C wanted to get married and have a family, but the author didn't. Despite not wanting to get married, they were sexually active, using only birth control pills. Then C got diagnosed with PCOS, which made her fear infertility. She hid her pregnancy, and when confronted, denied it initially. The author pushed for an abortion, but when they were about to go, the cat incident happened, leading C to believe it was a miracle and decide to continue the pregnancy.\n\nThe author broke up with her, refuses to take part in the child's life except for financial support. Now, the child is 5, and the author feels guilty but remains firm in his decision, believing C was selfish for deceiving him.\n\nSo, the key points here are: consent in pregnancy, responsibility towards a child, mental health factors, and the ethics of breaking up after the child is born.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the author is required to provide financial support, which he does. However, emotionally and ethically, this is more complex. The author didn't want children, which is his choice, but once a child is born, there's a societal expectation to be involved. The author feels wronged by C's deception, but she did get pregnant intentionally, even if she hid it. He had the opportunity to prevent the pregnancy with proper contraception, which they didn't use. Also, the ultimatum he gave (abortion or him) is a heavy decision, but once the pregnancy continued, he's still responsible.\n\nThe child now lacks a father figure, and the author's refusal to engage is causing emotional harm. Even if C had mental health issues, the author's decision to cut off contact entirely seems harsh. While he might feel he was wronged, the child isn't at fault. The author's stance that he \"wasn't ready\" doesn't absolve him of responsibility. Children need both parents, ideally, and his current position could be seen as selfish in the long run, even if he's angry about the situation.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of C's mental health and manipulation. She had a history of mental illness, which might have clouded her judgment, but that doesn't make it her sole fault. The author's lack of condom use and reliance on her birth control (which can fail) is on him too. However, once the child is born, his responsibility is there.\n\nIn terms of societal judgment, most people would likely side with the child needing a father. The author's argument about not validating C's disrespect is a bit self-centered; the child's well-being is more important than his resentment towards C. So, considering all factors, the author is in the wrong for cutting off the child and not taking responsibility beyond financial support.\n"
