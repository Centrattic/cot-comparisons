C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend after she secretly got pregnant despite him not wanting children.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both sides. The author was in a relationship with C, who had a history of mental health issues (bipolar disorder) and had a rough upbringing. He didn't want to get married or have kids. She ended up getting pregnant, but she was hiding it. He convinced her to get an abortion, but then when the cat was run over, she changed her mind. The author broke up with her and hasn't been involved in the child's life since. Now, the child is 5 and mentions missing his dad.\n\nThe author argues that he was wronged because she deceived him and went against his wishes. But others see him as abandoning his child, which is seen as immoral. The key points here are consent to parenthood, the impact on the child, and the ethical responsibilities of a father.\n\nOn one hand, the author wasn't ready for a child and felt pressured and deceived. However, once a child is born, there are societal expectations and moral obligations towards the child, regardless of the circumstances. Even if the author didn't want to be a father, the child has a right to a relationship with both parents. The author's decision to not be involved could be seen as neglectful, especially since he's paying child support but not engaging emotionally or physically.\n\nAlso, considering the child's well-being, the author's absence is affecting the child's perception and emotional development. The child feels his dad isn't playing with him, which is a valid emotional need. The author's stance that he won't reverse his decision despite the child's age and needs might be viewed as inconsiderate.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of consent. The author didn't agree to the pregnancy, and the girlfriend's actions were secretive. But once a child is born, the legal and moral responsibilities are in place regardless of initial consent. The author's refusal to engage beyond financial support could be seen as not fulfilling those responsibilities.\n\nSo weighing both sides, the author's actions have negative consequences for the child and society might judge him for that. Even if he feels wronged initially, the ongoing neglect of the child's needs could place the responsibility on him. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
