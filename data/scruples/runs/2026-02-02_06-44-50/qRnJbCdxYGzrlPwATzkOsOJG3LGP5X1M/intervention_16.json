C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about breaking up with a pregnant girlfriend. The author dates a girl named C for three years in high school. C has a rough background with her parents, becomes religious, has bipolar disorder, and wants a family. The author wasn't interested in marriage, but they had a sexual relationship without condoms, leading to pregnancy. The author convinced C to get an abortion, but on the day of the procedure, her cat dies, which they see as a sign from God to keep the baby. The author breaks up with her, refuses to be involved, pays child support but no contact. Now, the child is 5 and says he doesn't play with his dad. The author feels guilty but remains firm.\n\nFirst, the author had unprotected sex with a partner who was on birth control but later developed a condition (PCOS) that might affect fertility. The author didn't use a condom, which is a key factor here. Even if the birth control was supposed to prevent pregnancy, relying solely on it without a condom is risky. So the author's actions contributed to the pregnancy.\n\nNext, when the pregnancy happened, the author tried to convince C to get an abortion. But C decided to keep the child after the \"miracle\" with the cat. The author then broke up with her. The author's stance is that he wasn't ready for a child and felt disrespected by C's decision. However, once a child is born, the parent has responsibilities regardless of the initial circumstances. The author is paying child support, which is legally required, but refuses contact. The child is growing up without a father figure, which could have emotional consequences.\n\nThe author's argument is that C was deceitful by hiding her pregnancy and that he wasn't ready. But by having unprotected sex, he shared responsibility for the potential pregnancy. Also, when a child is born, parental responsibility usually includes being involved in their life. The author's refusal to engage, despite guilt, might be seen as neglecting his duties as a father. Even if the relationship ended, the child has a right to a relationship with both parents unless there's a valid legal reason to restrict contact.\n\nAdditionally, the author's decision to pay child support without involvement might be legally sufficient, but emotionally and ethically, it's questionable. The child's well-being is important, and the author's absence could affect the child's development. The fact that the child is already expressing confusion about his \"daddy\" suggests that the author's absence is impactful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author felt pressured into a situation he wasn't ready for. C's mental health and possible manipulation (hiding pregnancy) are factors. But once the child is born, the author's responsibility doesn't end. The author's actions may have legal standing (paying support), but morally, he's avoiding his parental role, which could be seen as wrong.\n\nSo considering all aspects, while there are complexities, the author's refusal to be involved in his child's life despite the ongoing existence of the child might make him at fault. The initial pregnancy was a result of both parties' actions (unprotected sex), and the author's decision to disengage after the child's birth is where the wrong lies.\n"
