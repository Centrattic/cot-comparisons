C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" post) is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The author had a 3-year relationship in high school with a girl named C, who has a difficult background and bipolar disorder. C wanted to get married and have a family, but the author wasn't interested in proposing. They were sexually active, using the pill but no condoms. C was diagnosed with PCOS, which made conception less likely, but she still got pregnant. The author found out, convinced her to get an abortion, but then the cat got hit by the car as they were going to the airport, which her grandparents interpreted as a miracle. C then decided to keep the child, and the author broke up with her. Since then, he's paid child support but hasn't had contact and refuses to take part in the child's life.\n\nNow, the user says they think the author is in the wrong but are curious about my perspective. The question is whether he is in the wrong, answer A or B.\n\nLet me consider both sides. On one hand, the author didn't want to have a child and wasn't ready. He asked her to have an abortion, and she went against that decision. But once the child was born, he chose to cut contact and not be involved. That seems harsh. On the other hand, C was deceptive about her pregnancy, which the author might see as betrayal. However, once the child is born, the author is still a parent, and cutting off completely could have negative effects on the child, as seen with the comment from N about his daddy not playing with him.\n\nLegal considerations: In many places, parents have legal responsibilities even if they don't have contact. The author is paying child support, which is good, but not providing a relationship. Emotionally, though, is he in the wrong? The initial breakup was after she decided against the abortion, which he had insisted on. But once the child exists, the parent's responsibility doesn't end with financial support. So even if he wasn't ready, he's still responsible for the child's well-being. \n\nAlso, C's mental health is a factor. She has bipolar disorder and a history of trauma, which might have contributed to her actions. The author might have a point about her being selfish, but so is he if he's not involved in the child's life. The cat incident being seen as a miracle is a bit absurd, but from their perspective, especially given their religious upbringing, it might have been a pivotal moment.\n\nBut the main issue here is the author's refusal to be part of his child's life. While he might not want to have a child, once the child is born, it's not just about his wants anymore. The child has a right to know their father and to have a relationship with him. The author's guilt is evident, but his actions are affecting the child's life. Child support is necessary, but emotional and physical presence is also crucial for a child's development.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author's decision to not be involved after the child's birth could be seen as selfish. Even if he believes he was wronged initially by C's decision to keep the child, the child is now a separate person with their own needs. The author might have the right to not be an involved parent, but in terms of being a good person and doing what's best for the child, he's definitely in the wrong. The fact that he's distant causes the child to feel neglected, which is harmful.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). The child's well-being should be a priority, and while the initial circumstances are problematic, cutting off contact entirely isn't justifiable. The author should at least be willing to be part of the child's life in some capacity, even if it's not as a co-parent.\n"
