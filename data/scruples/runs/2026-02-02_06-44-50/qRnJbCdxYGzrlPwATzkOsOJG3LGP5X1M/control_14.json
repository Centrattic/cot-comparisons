C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up with a pregnant girlfriend and then not being involved in the child's life.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author was in a relationship with C for three years in high school. C had a difficult upbringing and was deeply religious, which influenced her desire to get married and have a child. The author didn't want to get married or have kids at that time. They used contraception, but C developed PCOS, which made pregnancy harder. She then got pregnant, hid it, and the author wanted an abortion, which she agreed to but then changed her mind when the cat died on the way to the abortion. The author broke up with her and hasn't been involved with the child, even though he's paying child support. Now he's feeling some guilt but still stands by his decision.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, he's paying child support, which is correct. But morally and socially, people are judging him. He feels he wasn't ready for a child and that C was being selfish by deceiving him. However, C might argue that she was doing what she felt was right, especially with her religious beliefs. The author's breakup was because of the pregnancy, which he saw as forced on him. But once the child was born, he has a responsibility, even if he didn't want it. \n\nOn the other hand, C did hide the pregnancy and then went against the agreed plan for an abortion. That's a big betrayal. The author might feel justified in cutting ties because of that deceit. However, the child is now 5 and he's not involved, which is affecting the child's well-being. The comment about the child saying \"my daddy doesn't play with me\" is sad, indicating emotional harm. \n\nThe author's perspective is that he wasn't ready, and C was selfish. But the child's needs are there now. Even if C was wrong, the author's refusal to engage with the child could be seen as neglectful. Legally, he has responsibilities, but the question is about being in the wrong morally. \n\nI think there are two wrongs here. C manipulated and deceived him by hiding her pregnancy and using the cat incident as a reason to keep the child. The author, while not wanting a child, might have taken a stance that's neglecting the child's needs now. However, he did pay child support, so maybe he's not entirely wrong. But the emotional impact on the child is significant. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author is in the wrong because he chose to cut off contact with his child, leading to emotional harm. Even if C was at fault for deceiving him, he has a responsibility to his child. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
