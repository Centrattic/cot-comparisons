C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that he broke up with his pregnant girlfriend, who later had their child, and he hasn't maintained contact despite paying child support. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend, C, had a traumatic background and bipolar disorder. She was very focused on having a family but the author wasn't interested in marriage. She was on birth control, but they didn't use condoms, leading to pregnancy. Then there's the part where she was hiding the pregnancy until it was too late for an abortion. The cat incident was a turning point where she decided to keep the child. The author felt forced into parenthood and broke up, refusing to be involved.\n\nThe author's main argument is that C was being selfish by deceiving him and going against his wishes. He wasn't ready for a child. However, once the child was born, he cut off contact. Now, he's feeling some guilt but is firm in his decision, seeing C's actions as disrespectful. The user thinks he's wrong, but I need to consider the legal and moral aspects.\n\nLegally, the father has responsibilities regardless of his consent. Even if he didn't want the child, he's obligated to pay child support. Emotionally, the child needs a relationship with both parents unless there's a legal reason to prevent contact. The author's refusal to engage might be harming the child's well-being. C's actions, while manipulative, don't absolve the father from his responsibilities. The author's decision to disengage could be seen as neglectful, even if he feels wronged. The child's best interest should be the priority here.\n\nOn the other hand, the father's perspective is valid in that he didn't consent to parenthood and was manipulated. But once a child is born, parental responsibility is a societal expectation. His current stance might be harming the child, and it's important to consider the child's emotional needs. The author's guilt when hearing the child say he doesn't play with him indicates some internal conflict, but he's choosing not to act on it. This could be where he's in the wrong, as the child's welfare should take precedence over personal grievances with the mother.\n\nSo, while the mother's actions were problematic, the father's refusal to maintain a relationship with his child, despite knowing it's affecting the child, seems to place him in the wrong morally. Even if he feels wronged, neglecting the child's needs is a significant issue. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
