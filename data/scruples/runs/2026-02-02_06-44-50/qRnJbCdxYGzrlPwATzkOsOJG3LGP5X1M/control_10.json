C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he broke up with his pregnant girlfriend, C, after she went through with the pregnancy despite his insistence on an abortion. Now he's being judged for not being involved with their child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author says he wasn't ready for a child and that C was being selfish by getting pregnant without his consent. But C had her own reasons related to her mental health and upbringing. She had bipolar disorder, which might have influenced her decisions, and her family's religious beliefs played a role in her decision to continue the pregnancy after the cat incident. \n\nThe author feels he wasn't given a choice because C hid the pregnancy and then went against his wishes when the cat died and she decided to keep the baby. However, he did pay child support and his parents have been involved. But he refuses to have contact with his son, which is causing the child emotional distress. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, he might be required to pay child support, but emotionally and morally, there's a question about his responsibility as a father. Even if he didn't want the child initially, once the child is born, the father has responsibilities. The author's refusal to be part of the child's life could be seen as selfish now, as the child is growing up without a father figure. \n\nBut then again, the circumstances leading to the pregnancy might be complicated. C's deception and the pressure she faced from her family and religion might contribute to the situation. However, he didn't take responsibility for his part in not using protection and contributing to the pregnancy. \n\nThere's also the aspect of his mental state and readiness. He wasn't prepared for parenthood, but once the child is born, there's an ongoing responsibility. The fact that the child is now expressing that his \"daddy doesn't play with me\" suggests that the lack of involvement is affecting him. \n\nSo, while the author's position might be understandable in terms of not wanting to be a parent, the ongoing neglect of his son's emotional needs could place the blame on him. Even if he feels wronged initially, the child's well-being is a significant factor here. The author's decision to maintain distance despite the child's needs might make him equally at fault for the current situation.\n"
