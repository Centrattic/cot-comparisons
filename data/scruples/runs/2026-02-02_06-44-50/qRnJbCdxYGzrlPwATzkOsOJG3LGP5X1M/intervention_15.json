C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the author broke up with his pregnant girlfriend. The girlfriend had a troubled past, including a family history of mental health issues and religious upbringing. She had a history of seeking a family, which she was denied due to PCOS. Then she got pregnant. The author wanted an abortion, and she agreed, but then changed her mind after a \"miracle\" with the cat. The author then broke up with her and hasn't been involved in the child's life, despite paying support.\n\nThe key points here: The author felt he wasn't ready for a child and wasn't consulted, as she deceptively got pregnant. However, she did agree to the abortion initially. Then she changed her mind after an event she interpreted as a miracle. The author then left, not participating in the child's life. Now, the child is growing up without a father, which is causing emotional issues.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the author has a responsibility as the father. Even if he didn't want the child, he's financially supporting but emotionally absent. Legally, he's meeting some obligations but not others. Ethically, it's more complicated. He might feel wronged because he wasn't ready, but the child's well-being is a factor. The author's parents are involved, but he's not.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions: She was deceptive about her pregnancy and then changed her mind about the abortion. Her decision to keep the child after the cat incident might be seen as self-centered, but she had her own mental health issues (bipolar disorder, trauma) that influenced her. However, her actions led to the author feeling betrayed.\n\nThe author's current stance is that he's not willing to reverse his decision, which affects the child's emotional state. The child is already saying his dad doesn't play with him. The author feels guilt but is holding on to his original decision.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, both parties have flaws. The author could argue that he wasn't ready and the pregnancy was a result of deception. However, once the child is born, the father has a responsibility to the child regardless of the circumstances. The author's refusal to be part of the child's life, despite financial support, might be seen as negligent. The girlfriend's actions were selfish, but the author's choice to walk away may not absolve him of all responsibility.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, he's not violating laws by not being involved beyond child support. Ethically, it's more about societal standards. Most people would argue that a father should have a relationship with his child, even if he didn't want it. The author's stance might be seen as selfish by not considering the child's needs now. However, his initial position was that he was not ready, which is a personal choice. The problem arises when that choice affects another person's life (the child) negatively.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author's actions have consequences that go beyond his initial decision. Even if he feels wronged, the child's well-being is a significant factor. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong now for not engaging with his child, even if the initial situation had complexities.\n"
