C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author broke up with his pregnant girlfriend, C, after she decided to keep the child despite their earlier agreement (or lack thereof). \n\nFirst, there's the context of their relationship. C had a tough upbringing, which might have influenced her strong desire to have a family. The author, on the other hand, wasn't interested in marriage or having kids. They were using contraception, but there was a failure leading to pregnancy. The author tried to convince C to have an abortion, but when she refused at the last minute due to what they consider a \"miracle\" (the cat dying), he left her.\n\nNow, the key points to consider. Legally, in many places, a man isn't automatically responsible for child support unless he's married to the mother or has legal paternity established. The author is paying child support, which might be a point in his favor, but he's not involved in the child's life. The mother, C, is clearly the one who chose to keep the child, so she has the primary responsibility. However, the father's rights and responsibilities vary by jurisdiction, but generally, if he hasn't legally acknowledged paternity, he might not have legal standing to make decisions about the child's upbringing.\n\nEthically, the question is more complex. The author feels he was wronged because the child was a result of a situation he didn't consent to. C, however, was acting on her desire to have a family, which was deeply personal and influenced by her past. The author's refusal to engage with the child now might be seen as selfish because it affects the child's life. The child doesn't have a say in the matter, and the author's absence could impact the child's well-being.\n\nBut then, the author was given a choice before the pregnancy was discovered. He tried to get C to abort the child, and when she refused, he left. Now, he's not participating, which could be seen as a valid decision given his initial stance. However, the child exists now, and the author's choice to not be involved is denying the child a relationship with their father. Some might argue that the author's responsibility doesn't end with the pregnancy but continues as a parent.\n\nC's actions might be seen as manipulative if she intentionally deceived the author to get him to father a child. However, she might have genuinely believed she was doing the right thing given her religious beliefs and personal history. The author's ultimatum of \"me or the baby\" could be seen as putting pressure on C to make a decision that's not entirely his to make.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, even if the conception wasn't entirely consensual in terms of parenthood, once the child is born, the father's responsibility might extend beyond his initial wishes. The author's choice to not be involved could be seen as neglecting that responsibility, especially considering the child's rights to have a relationship with both parents.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's perspective is that he was coerced into a situation he didn't want. He might genuinely feel that he's not equipped to be a father and that his absence is better for everyone. But this is a matter of personal choice versus duty.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors: C's actions were self-serving and possibly manipulative, but the author's decision to disengage is causing harm to the child. Legally, he's fulfilling some obligations (child support), but emotionally and socially, he's absent. The author's guilt and the child's feelings (as mentioned by the mother) indicate a negative impact. Therefore, even if there were issues in the past, the current situation where the author refuses to be part of his son's life might make him the one at fault.\n"
