C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he broke up with his pregnant girlfriend, who had a history of mental health issues and a traumatic upbringing. They were in a high school relationship, and he didn't want to get married or have kids. She was on birth control but got pregnant anyway, possibly because they didn't use condoms. Then she tried to get an abortion but when the cat died before the procedure, she changed her mind. He left her, hasn't been involved in the child's life, but pays child support. Now he's feeling some guilt but still stands by his decision.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author claims he didn't want kids and that she was selfish for deceiving him. But on the other hand, he was sexually active without using protection, even though he knew she had PCOS which made conception harder. Also, she did try to get an abortion but changed her mind because of a \"miracle\" with the cat. He gave her an ultimatum, which is a big pressure tactic. \n\nLegally, he's paying child support, which is right. But emotionally and ethically, is it his fault? He was in a relationship and had sex without protection. Maybe he's responsible for the pregnancy. Also, once she decided to keep the child, breaking up and cutting off contact might be seen as abandoning the child. Even if he didn't want the child, the child has a right to a relationship with both parents. His parents are involved, but he's not. The child is starting school and saying he doesn't play with his dad. That's a child's innocent perspective, but the author's absence is affecting the child. \n\nHe says she was selfish for deceiving him, but she might have felt desperate due to her mental health issues and upbringing. She might have felt that having a child was the only way to have a family. The author gave her an ultimatum, which might have contributed to her making a decision under pressure. Then when the cat died, she saw it as a sign, which is her religious belief. The author is now stuck with not being involved, but he could choose to reconnect. His stance is firm, but maybe that's not the best for the child. \n\nSo, in terms of responsibility, both have some. The author didn't use protection, so he's partly responsible. He also made an ultimatum, which might not have been fair. After the child was born, cutting off contact could be seen as neglectful. However, the girlfriend did deceive him by hiding the pregnancy and changing her mind after the ultimatum. \n\nBut from an ethical standpoint, the child's well-being is important. The author's decision to not be involved is affecting the child's life. Even if he feels wronged, the child shouldn't suffer. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not taking responsibility post-birth. However, the girlfriend's actions were also questionable. \n\nSo, considering all points, it's a complex situation. The author's actions contributed to the pregnancy, and his decision to leave and not be involved is harming the child. Therefore, he might be in the wrong. But the girlfriend also had a role in not using protection properly and changing her mind after the ultimatum. However, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he chose not to be involved despite being the father, I think the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
