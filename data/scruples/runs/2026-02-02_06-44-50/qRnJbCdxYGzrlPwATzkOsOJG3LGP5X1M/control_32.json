C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. So first, I need to look at the facts presented.\n\nThe author was in a high school relationship with a girl named C. She had a tough upbringing, bipolar disorder, and became fixated on getting married and having a family. The author wasn't interested in marriage, but they were sexually active, and she ended up pregnant. He wanted an abortion, set an ultimatum, and she agreed. But then there was the incident with the cat being hit by the car on the way to the airport, which she and her grandparents interpreted as a miracle, so she decided to keep the baby instead. The author broke up with her after that and hasn't been involved in the child's life, only paying child support. Now he's feeling guilt but remains firm in his decision.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent to parenthood, the circumstances surrounding the pregnancy, and the subsequent relationship breakdown. The author claims he wasn't ready for a child and that she deceived him by hiding the pregnancy. However, she did get pregnant while they were in a sexual relationship, which inherently involves the possibility of pregnancy. The fact that she had a mental health condition and a difficult past might influence her actions, but it doesn't absolve responsibility. \n\nHe gave her an ultimatum, which is a significant point. By setting that condition, he was clear about his stance, but she chose to go against his wishes after the \"miracle\" incident. Now he's not involved in the child's life, which is causing the child emotional distress. The child is asking about the father, which is mentioned as \"my daddy doesn't play with me.\" That's a strong indicator of emotional harm, which is a factor in determining moral responsibility.\n\nIn terms of legal obligations, the author is paying child support, so he's fulfilling that duty. But emotionally and socially, there's an expectation for a father to be involved in his child's life. The author's refusal to engage despite the child's distress might be seen as selfish or neglectful. However, the initial situation where he wanted an abortion and she decided otherwise complicates things. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, while he had his reasons, the child's well-being is a major consideration. The author's parents are involved, which is good, but the father's absence is causing the child emotional pain. The author's stance is that he wasn't ready and that she was being selfish, but by not being present now, he's also impacting the child negatively. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be that he's in the wrong because he's not taking responsibility for his role in the child's life, even if the circumstances leading to the pregnancy were contentious. The child's emotional well-being is a strong factor here. However, there are nuances, but the majority view might lean towards A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because of the child's current emotional state and the father's refusal to engage despite the guilt he's feeling.\n"
