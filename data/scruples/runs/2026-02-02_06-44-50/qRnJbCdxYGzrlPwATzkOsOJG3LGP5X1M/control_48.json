C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend and not having contact with their child. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts as presented. The author was in a 3-year relationship with C. C had a difficult background, including a father who abandoned her and a mother who committed suicide. Her grandparents are devout Catholics. C has bipolar disorder, which might have affected her behavior. The author wasn't interested in marriage, and C wanted to get married and have a family. Despite her being on birth control and them not using condoms, C became pregnant. The doctor's diagnosis of PCOS made her think she might not conceive, which made her more determined. The author found out later, and C was hiding the pregnancy. He tried to convince her to get an abortion, but she changed her mind after a \"miracle\" with her cat dying, which they took as a sign from God. The author then broke up with her and hasn't been involved in the child's life, even though he pays child support. Now, he feels guilty but is sticking to his decision because he believes C was selfish and he wasn't ready for a child.\n\nSo, the main issues here are: consent to parenthood, the circumstances of the pregnancy, the abortion ultimatum, and the author's decision to cut off contact.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, once a child is born, the father has legal responsibilities, including child support. But emotional and ethical responsibilities are different. The author argues that the pregnancy was a result of deceit (C hiding the pregnancy) and that he was not given a choice. However, once the child is born, the father's role doesn't end just because he didn't want the child. Many would argue that the child's well-being is paramount, and the father should be involved despite his feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's perspective is that he was coerced into a situation he wasn't prepared for. He tried to prevent the pregnancy through an abortion, which was denied due to the cat incident. He feels betrayed by C's actions. But does that absolve him of his responsibility towards the child? Probably not. While his initial position might be understandable in terms of not being ready, the child's right to know their father and have a relationship is a significant factor. The author's decision to completely cut off contact is harmful to the child's development, which many would consider morally wrong.\n\nAlso, considering the psychological impact on the child, N is now 5 and is starting school. The mother's account of N saying, \"my daddy doesn't play with me,\" suggests that N is already feeling the absence. The author's guilt indicates internal conflict, but he's not taking action to change the situation. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, most people would emphasize the importance of the father's role in the child's life. Even if the circumstances were not ideal, the child's needs should come first. The author's refusal to engage beyond financial support is seen as selfish, especially since he has the opportunity to build a relationship now that N is growing up.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The author claims he was wronged by C's actions, which might have been manipulative. But once the child exists, the parent's responsibility is a separate issue. The author's decision to not be part of the child's life could be seen as neglectful, regardless of past circumstances.\n\nIn terms of societal judgment, the author's actions are likely viewed as wrong because he's prioritizing his own feelings over the child's. The question is whether breaking up and cutting off contact is justified. While he's allowed to set boundaries, complete disengagement might be too extreme. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's perspective is valid in terms of his initial unwillingness and the coercion he felt, the ongoing neglect of the child's emotional needs makes him at fault. The author is in the wrong because he's not fulfilling his parental responsibilities beyond financial support, which is harmful to the child's development.\n"
