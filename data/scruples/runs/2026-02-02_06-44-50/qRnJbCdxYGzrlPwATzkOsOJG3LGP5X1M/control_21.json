C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend and not maintaining a relationship with their child. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author was in a high school relationship, 5 years ago. The girlfriend, C, had a tough upbringing and became religious. She had bipolar disorder, which might have influenced her behavior. They were in a 3-year relationship. C wanted to get married and have a family, but the author wasn't interested. They had unprotected sex, leading to pregnancy after she was diagnosed with PCOS, which made her fear infertility. She hid the pregnancy until it was too late for an abortion. The author wanted an abortion, but she changed her mind after a \"miraculous\" cat incident. The author broke up with her, hasn't been involved with the child, N, but pays child support.\n\nNow, from a legal standpoint, the author is obligated to pay child support, which he's doing. But the ethical part is the crux here. The user is asking if he's in the wrong morally. \n\nThe author argues that C deceived him by hiding the pregnancy and forcing his hand with the ultimatum. He feels he was wronged and wasn't ready for a child. However, C's side is that she had mental health issues and a traumatic past. The author's decision to cut off contact might be seen as neglectful, especially since the child is now 5 and expressing a desire for his father. \n\nFrom a moral perspective, some might say that once a child is born, the father has a responsibility to be part of their life, regardless of the circumstances. The author's refusal to engage could be seen as selfish, even if he didn't want the child. On the other hand, if C manipulated the situation and went against their agreement, the author might feel justified in his stance. \n\nBut considering the child's well-being, the author's absence is affecting N's development. The child saying he doesn't play with his dad is a red flag. The author's guilt is there, but he's sticking to his decision. \n\nIn terms of accountability, both parties made decisions. The author didn't use protection, and C hid the pregnancy. But once the child is born, the father's role is often considered beyond just financial support. The author's actions could be seen as neglecting the child's emotional and social needs. \n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author is likely in the wrong because, despite his reasons, the child has a right to a relationship with both parents. The author's refusal to be involved, even now, could be harming the child. However, C's initial deception and pressure for an abortion might mitigate some of the author's responsibility. But ultimately, the decision to not be part of the child's life after birth is problematic. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
