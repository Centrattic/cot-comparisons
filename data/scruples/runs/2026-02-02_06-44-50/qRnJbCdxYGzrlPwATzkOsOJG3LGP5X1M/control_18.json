C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complicated. The user is the author of the story who broke up with his pregnant girlfriend, C. They had a three-year relationship in high school. C has a history of mental health issues, bipolar disorder, and a tough upbringing. She was really into the idea of marriage and having kids, but the author wasn't interested in marriage. They didn't use protection, and C was on birth control, but she developed PCOS, which made her think she couldn't get pregnant. Then she got pregnant anyway, hid it, and when confronted, denied it. The author tried to convince her to get an abortion, which they scheduled, but then the cat died, and she changed her mind. The author broke up with her, refused to be part of the child's life, and now feels guilty but still stands by his decision.\n\nHmm. So the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's look at the key points. First, the author didn't want to have a child, and C wanted one. But they were having unprotected sex while she was on birth control. Then she got pregnant but hid it. The author offered her an ultimatum: him or the baby. She agreed to the abortion but then changed her mind because of the cat incident. Now he's not involved in the child's life, which people are criticizing him for.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, parents have rights, but since he's not married and didn't take legal steps to terminate his parental rights, he's still legally responsible. So he has obligations to the child. But ethically, it's more complicated. The author feels he was blindsided and wasn't ready, but C was the one who became pregnant without using protection (they both didn't use condoms, his fault, but she was on birth control). However, birth control isn't 100% effective. The author's actions after the abortion decision\u2014breaking up and cutting off contact\u2014might be seen as selfish, especially since the child is now a part of his life. The guilt from the mother's side (C's family and religious beliefs) might play into this. The author's parents are involved, which complicates things further.\n\nBut considering the author's perspective, he felt pressured into a child he didn't want, and C's deception and manipulation (hiding the pregnancy until it was too late for an abortion) might be factors. However, once the child is born, the father has responsibilities. The author's refusal to engage could be seen as neglecting those responsibilities, even if he feels wronged. The child's well-being is important, and the author's decision to pay child support but not be involved is causing the child emotional harm, as seen when the child says his dad doesn't play with him. So the author's actions now are affecting the child's life, which is a strong argument against him.\n\nIn terms of morality, while the author might feel he was a victim of C's actions, once a child is born, the father has a duty to be involved. The author's stance that he won't change his mind because he feels C disrespected him seems to prioritize his own feelings over the child's needs. So even if he had reasons to feel wronged initially, his current actions are harming the child. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not being part of his child's life despite the circumstances.\n"
