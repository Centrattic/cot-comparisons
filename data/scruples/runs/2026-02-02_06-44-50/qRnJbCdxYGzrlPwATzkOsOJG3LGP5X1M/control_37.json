C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. The situation is pretty complicated.\n\nFirst, the author is a guy who had a long-term relationship with a girl named C. She had a tough upbringing and mental health issues, bipolar disorder. They were in a high school relationship, and she wanted to get married and have kids, but he wasn't interested in getting married. They were having unprotected sex, and she was on birth control, but she ended up getting pregnant anyway. Then she found out about her fertility issues, which made her even more desperate. \n\nThe author convinced her to get an abortion, but right before the procedure, the cat got hit by the car, and she and her grandparents saw it as a sign from God to keep the baby. So she went ahead with the pregnancy, and he broke up with her. He hasn't been involved in the child's life since, even though he pays child support. Now he's feeling guilty because the kid says he doesn't play with him, but he still thinks she was being selfish, and he's not ready to change his mind.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The possible answers are A (yes, he is in the wrong) or B (no, he's not). \n\nLet me break this down. The key points are:\n\n1. **Responsibility for the pregnancy**: He admits they had unprotected sex and he never used condoms, so he shares some responsibility. She was on birth control, but maybe it failed. However, he also didn't use condoms, so both contributed. But she ended up getting pregnant despite the birth control, which might not have been entirely his fault.\n\n2. **Her mental health and manipulation**: She had a traumatic past and bipolar disorder. Her actions might have been influenced by her mental health issues. She deceived him by hiding her pregnancy, which he found out later. He argues she was being selfish and disrespectful. However, her mental state could have impaired her judgment.\n\n3. **The ultimatum**: He gave her an ultimatum\u2014him or the baby. That's a big decision for a pregnant person and could be seen as pressuring her, which is not ideal. Abortion is a serious decision, and pressuring someone to have one can be harmful. But he also felt he wasn't ready for a child.\n\n4. **Breaking up after she decided to keep the baby**: He broke up with her because he didn't want to be a father. That's his choice, but it's also a significant responsibility to walk away from. However, staying in a relationship where one person doesn't want to be a parent might be challenging.\n\n5. **Current situation**: He's not involved in the child's life but pays child support. The child feels the absence of a father, which is a concern. The author feels guilty but is still firm in his decision. The community judges him, but he feels wronged.\n\nLegally, he's paying child support, which he should do. But emotionally and morally, the situation is more complex. The author's decision to not be involved raises questions about responsibility. While he wasn't ready for a child, becoming a parent is a lifelong commitment. His choice to cut ties could be seen as neglecting the child's needs, even if he's financially supporting them.\n\nOn the other hand, he was pressured into an ultimatum, and she manipulated the situation by hiding the pregnancy. His mental state and readiness for parenthood are also factors. However, once a child is born, the parent's responsibilities don't end just because they weren't prepared.\n\nEthically, there's a balance between personal choice and the child's well-being. The author's actions have consequences beyond his own satisfaction. The child deserves a father figure, even if the relationship with the mother is strained. His current stance might be causing emotional harm to both the child and the mother.\n\nIn terms of societal judgment, many might side with the child's need for a father and the author's responsibility. However, his perspective is valid in that he wasn't given a choice in the pregnancy and felt forced into a situation he wasn't ready for. But once the child is born, the responsibilities are his, regardless of his initial decision.\n\nSo, considering all factors, while the author has valid reasons for his actions, the lack of involvement in the child's life despite paying financial support could be seen as morally wrong. The child's well-being is a significant factor here. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (he is in the wrong) because of the ongoing neglect of the child's emotional needs, even if he's financially supporting them.\n"
