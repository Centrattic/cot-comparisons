C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that he broke up with his pregnant girlfriend after she initially agreed to an abortion but then changed her mind when her cat was run over on the way to the clinic, seeing it as a sign from God. Now, the child is 5, and he hasn't been involved in the child's life, only paying child support.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was in a relationship with a woman who had mental health issues, specifically bipolar disorder, and a difficult background. He wasn't interested in marriage or having kids, but they were sexually active without protection. She got pregnant, and he wanted an abortion. She agreed to go to Melbourne for it, but then changed her mind when her cat was hit by the car. He broke up with her, hasn't been involved in the child's life, and now feels guilty when the child says \"my daddy doesn't play with me.\"\n\nThe user's stance is that the author is in the wrong, but wants to know the assistant's opinion. The options are A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No).\n\nLet me consider the ethical aspects here. The author claims he was not ready for a child and that the girlfriend was selfish. He was paying child support but avoided contact. However, the girlfriend did try to get an abortion, which she later canceled. The author argues that she was deceptive and that he had no say, but he also didn't use protection despite her being on birth control. There's the issue of responsibility to a child, even if the child wasn't planned. The child is now 5 and is being affected by the father's absence.\n\nOn one hand, the author wasn't prepared for parenthood and the girlfriend made a last-minute change. On the other hand, once the child is born, the father has a responsibility. The author stopped contact, which could be seen as neglect. The girlfriend's actions were indeed problematic, but the father's refusal to engage with his child might be equally damaging.\n\nIn many societies, child support is a legal requirement, but involvement in a child's life is also considered a parental duty. The author's stance might be seen as selfish now, even if he felt wronged initially. The child's well-being is a key factor here. So, while the girlfriend's actions were not great, the author's continued disengagement could be viewed as in the wrong, as he's impacting the child's life negatively by not being present. Therefore, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
