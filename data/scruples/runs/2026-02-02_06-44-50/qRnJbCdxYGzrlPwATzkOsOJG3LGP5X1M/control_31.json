C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he broke up with his pregnant girlfriend after she ended up pregnant, and he wanted an abortion, but she went ahead with the pregnancy after a \"miracle\" with her cat. Now he's not involved with the child and feels guilty but still stands by his decision.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author's perspective: he was in a relationship where the girlfriend had a strong desire to have kids, which he wasn't interested in. He thought she was being selfish by getting pregnant without his consent and then changing her mind about the abortion. He felt deceived and hurt, leading him to break up and not be involved. He's paying child support but not engaging with the child.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend had a traumatic background, mental health issues (bipolar disorder), and PCOS. She was told she might not be able to conceive, which made her even more determined. When she got pregnant, he pressured her for an abortion, which she agreed to but then backed out after the cat incident. The author then left her, leading to the child being born without his involvement. The child now mentions not having a dad, which is causing guilt for the author.\n\nLegally, the author has obligations as a parent, so not being involved could be seen as neglectful, even if he didn't want the child. Emotionally, he might feel wronged because he wasn't ready and felt manipulated. However, once a child is born, parental responsibility is a big part of being a parent. The author's refusal to be involved despite the child's needs might be seen as selfish now. Also, the girlfriend's actions (deception about the pregnancy and then changing her mind) were problematic, but the author's response of cutting off entirely could be considered neglectful.\n\nIt's a complex situation. The author's actions led to the breakup and non-involvement, which affects the child's well-being. While he had his reasons, society often places a high value on parental responsibility. So even if he feels wronged, his current stance might be seen as in the wrong because he's not fulfilling his parental duties. However, there's also the aspect of coercion and lack of consent in the pregnancy, which complicates things. But overall, the consensus might lean towards the author being in the wrong because he's not engaging with his child despite the child's needs and the legal/ethical responsibilities.\n"
