C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author broke up with his pregnant girlfriend, who had a rough past. They were in a high school relationship, and she had mental health issues. They were sexually active without using condoms, and she was on birth control. She later got pregnant, and he wanted an abortion, but she changed her mind when their cat was run over, seeing it as a sign from God. He then broke up with her and hasn't been involved in the child's life, despite paying child support. Now he feels guilty but hasn't changed his stance.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, from a moral perspective, he's not involved in his child's life. Legally, he's paying child support, so that's a responsibility. But emotionally and ethically, he's cutting off contact. The child is starting school and is already missing his father, according to the mother's report.\n\nThe author's argument is that the girlfriend tricked him into having a child, and he wasn't ready. He saw the abortion as an option but she changed her mind. However, once the child is born, he has a responsibility. Even if he didn't want the child initially, the child is now a person with needs. The fact that the mother might have manipulated the situation doesn't absolve the father of his parental duties.\n\nAlso, the author is being judged by others and his parents, which might add to the complexity. But from a societal and ethical standpoint, cutting off contact seems harsh. The child deserves to have a relationship with both parents if possible, unless there's abuse or harm. The author hasn't mentioned any such issues; he just refuses to be involved. That seems like a personal choice that affects the child negatively.\n\nHowever, the author's feelings of being wronged are valid. The mother did hide the pregnancy and made a unilateral decision to keep the baby against his wishes. But the consequences of that decision affect more than just them now. The child's well-being is a significant factor here. Even if the author feels wronged, the child shouldn't be the one to suffer from the conflict between the parents.\n\nSo, in terms of right and wrong, the author is in the wrong because he's not fulfilling his role as a father. While his situation is complex and he has reasons for his actions, the impact on the child is a major ethical consideration. The mother's actions were selfish, but the father's continued disengagement also lacks responsibility. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
