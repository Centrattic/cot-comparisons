C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. The situation is complicated with several factors.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that his girlfriend, C, had a difficult upbringing and mental health issues (bipolar disorder). She was very focused on having a family, which he wasn't ready for. They were sexually active without condoms, and she had PCOS, making pregnancy less likely. She then got pregnant, which she hid. When he found out, he convinced her to get an abortion, but then a \"miracle\" happened with the cat being hit by the car, leading her to change her mind. He broke up with her after she decided to keep the baby.\n\nNow, he's been paying child support but hasn't been involved. The child knows about the dad and is hurt by his absence. The user thinks the author is wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nHmm. Let's consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, the father has responsibilities, and cutting off contact entirely might not be in the child's best interest. Emotionally, the father feels wronged because he wasn't ready and felt forced into a situation. But C's actions\u2014deceiving about the pregnancy and then changing her mind due to a perceived miracle\u2014might be seen as self-centered. However, the father's refusal to engage with his child could be seen as neglectful. The child's well-being is a key factor here. Even if the father isn't ready, the child has a right to a relationship with both parents. The father's decision to continue child support is good, but not being present emotionally is harmful. The situation is a mess, but the father's stance on not changing his mind despite the child's feelings suggests he's prioritizing his own hurt over the child's needs. So, while both parties have issues, the father's current actions are harmful to the child, making him at least partly responsible. But the question is if he's in the wrong. Considering societal norms and child welfare, he is in the wrong for cutting off the child's life. So answer A.\n"
