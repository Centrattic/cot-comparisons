C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author was in a 3-year relationship with C in high school. C had a tough upbringing, with a father who abandoned her and a mother who committed suicide. She was raised by devout Catholic grandparents and has bipolar disorder. The author mentions that C was very focused on getting married and having a family, but he wasn't ready to propose. They had unprotected sex, and she was on birth control. Then she was diagnosed with PCOS, which made her worried about her fertility. Later, she got pregnant and hid it. When confronted, she denied it, but eventually they planned an abortion. But then the cat incident happened, leading her to believe it was a sign from God to keep the baby. The author broke up with her, refused to be involved, pays child support but no contact. Now the kid is 5 and says his daddy doesn't play with him. The author feels guilty but still thinks he was right because he wasn't ready, and she was selfish.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, he's paying child support, which he's supposed to do. But ethically, it's more complex. The key points here are consent, deception, mental health factors, and the consequences on the child.\n\nThe author mentions that C deceived him by hiding her pregnancy. Deception is a factor here, but she was struggling with her mental health (bipolar disorder and trauma from her upbringing). However, the author also used contraception (oral contraceptives) but didn't use condoms, which could have contributed to the pregnancy. He argues that he wasn't ready for a child, which is his personal choice, but once the child exists, he has a responsibility towards it. \n\nBreaking up because of an unplanned pregnancy might be seen as a personal choice, but cutting off contact entirely after the child is born raises ethical concerns. The child has a right to a relationship with both parents, unless there's a valid reason (like abuse or neglect) which isn't mentioned here. The author's refusal to engage despite the child's needs could be seen as neglectful, even if he's paying support.\n\nAlso, the cat incident being interpreted as a \"miracle\" seems like a cultural or religious belief that influenced C's decision, but that doesn't excuse the author's lack of involvement. The author's stance is that he wasn't given a choice, but he did make a choice to not participate further, which affects the child's life.\n\nThe response from his community and family judging him might reflect societal expectations about parental responsibility. While he has his reasons, the child's well-being is a significant factor. The guilt he feels when the child says \"my daddy doesn't play with me\" suggests he's aware of the emotional impact of his decision.\n\nIn terms of ethical frameworks, utilitarianism would look at the overall happiness. His actions caused harm to the child and C, even if they were trying to protect his own boundaries. Deontological ethics might argue that he has a duty to his child regardless of circumstances. \n\nConsidering all this, while there's some justification for his initial decision due to deception and unpreparedness, the ongoing refusal to engage with the child seems to place him in the wrong from an ethical standpoint. The child's welfare and rights are paramount, and cutting off contact entirely without a valid reason (like abuse) is generally seen as harmful.\n"
