C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to unpack this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. Let me go through the details step by step.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with C, who had a tough past and bipolar disorder. C wanted to get married and have a family, but the author wasn't interested in marriage. They were having sex without condoms, and she was on birth control. Then she developed PCOS, which made pregnancy less likely, but she still got pregnant. The author tried to convince her to get an abortion, but when she found out the cat died before the procedure, she changed her mind. The author then broke up with her and hasn't been involved with the child.\n\nNow, I need to consider both sides. The author claims he wasn't ready for a child and felt deceived because she hid the pregnancy. She also had mental health issues and a history of trauma. On the other hand, the author didn't use protection despite knowing she was on birth control, which might have contributed to the pregnancy. The abortion was canceled due to the cat's death, which they saw as a sign from God. The author refuses to be part of the child's life now, even though he pays child support.\n\nLegally, he's obligated to support the child, so that's not the issue. Ethically, it's more complicated. The author feels wronged because he wasn't ready and she supposedly deceived him. However, once the child was born, he has a responsibility towards the child. The child's well-being is a key point here. The child is growing up not knowing his father, and the author's absence might be affecting him emotionally. The author's stance is that he doesn't want to validate what he sees as her disrespect, but the child's needs are separate from the parents' conflicts.\n\nAlso, the author's parents are involved with the child, which might help, but the child still lacks a relationship with his biological father. The author's guilt is evident when he hears the child say he doesn't play with him. Despite this, he remains firm in his decision.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author's decision not to engage with the child despite the circumstances might be seen as neglecting his paternal responsibilities. While his initial refusal due to being unprepared is understandable, once the child is born, the father's role extends beyond personal readiness. The author's continued absence affects the child's life and could be considered morally wrong, even if the pregnancy was a result of conflict.\n\nSo, even though there are valid points on both sides, the author's refusal to be part of his child's life, regardless of past issues with the mother, places a significant burden on the child. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
