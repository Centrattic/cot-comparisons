C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with their pregnant girlfriend. The situation is complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the author's ex-girlfriend had a difficult background, with a history of mental health issues, specifically bipolar disorder. That's important because it might affect her decision-making. She wanted to get married and have a family, but the author wasn't into it. They were having unprotected sex, which led to pregnancy. The ex was on birth control, but then got diagnosed with PCOS, which might have affected the effectiveness. The author felt pressured and tried to convince her to get an abortion, which she initially agreed to, but then backed out after an incident with her cat being hit by a car. She took it as a sign from God to keep the baby. The author then broke up with her, refused to take part in the child's life, and hasn't had contact beyond paying child support. Now the child is 5 and mentions the daddy issue, causing the author some guilt but he's still firm in his stance.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. The author did not want children and the ex knew that. However, she manipulated the situation by hiding her pregnancy and then changing her mind about the abortion. The author's actions led to a lack of contact with the child, which is legally and morally problematic. Even if the ex's actions were deceptive, once the child exists, the father has responsibilities. Abandoning the child might be seen as neglectful. On the other hand, the ex's mental health and the fact that she was under pressure from her family (especially the grandparents' religious influence) complicates her actions. But the author's refusal to engage with the child, despite the mother's faults, might be more harmful to the child's well-being. The author's stance is that he wasn't ready, but once the child is born, parental responsibilities come into play regardless of readiness. The legal obligation to pay child support is there, but emotional and social obligations are also significant. The child's well-being is paramount, and the author's guilt over the child's comments suggests he's aware of the impact. However, if the author truly believes he's not ready, maybe he could work towards a better relationship instead of cutting off contact entirely. But he hasn't, so from a societal standpoint, he's failing in his duty as a parent. Even if the initial situation was a result of the mother's actions, the child is innocent and deserves both parents' involvement if possible. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he's choosing not to be part of his child's life, which is harmful to the child. The mother's actions were also wrong, but the author's response is equally problematic.\n"
