C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complicated. So, the author is a guy who broke up with his pregnant girlfriend, who had a difficult past, including a mentally unstable parent and a history of depression. She had bipolar disorder which caused erratic moods. They were in a relationship where he wasn't ready for marriage or kids, but she was pushing for it. She ended up getting pregnant, but she had PCOS, making pregnancy less likely. She hid the pregnancy until it was too late for an abortion except in Melbourne. He convinced her to get one, but then the car accident with the cat happened, and they took it as a sign from God to keep the baby. He broke up with her and hasn't been involved with the child. Now the kid is talking about his \"daddy\" and the author feels guilty but still stands by his decision.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author didn't use protection, which contributed to the pregnancy. He did try to get her to abort the baby, which is a major decision and might be seen as pressuring her. However, the woman's mental health issues complicate things. She might not have been in a stable state to make decisions, especially considering her history of bipolar disorder and the traumatic upbringing. She might have been acting on her mental health's influence rather than her own free will. \n\nBut then, her actions, like hiding the pregnancy and then pretending to be surprised, could be seen as deceptive. The author feels he was deprived of his right to an abortion, which is a significant point. However, once the child is born, the author has responsibilities as a parent, even if he didn't want the child. Child support is a legal obligation, but emotional involvement is another matter. Cutting off contact entirely might be seen as selfish, especially as the child grows older and starts asking about his father.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's initial decision to break off the relationship was based on not wanting a child. But by not staying involved, he's affecting the child's life. The woman's actions were indeed manipulative, but the author's response to completely disengage might be harsh. The question is whether his actions are justified given the circumstances. \n\nThere's also the aspect of consent and shared responsibility. Both parties contributed to the situation. The author didn't use condoms, so he had a role in the pregnancy. While he wasn't ready for a child, the woman's mental health struggles might have clouded her judgment. However, she made the choice to carry the baby to term despite the ultimatum. The author's guilt might be valid, but his decision to not participate in the child's life could be seen as neglectful. \n\nIn terms of societal judgment, most people might see the author as abandoning his responsibility, even if he wasn't ready. But there's also the argument that he was coerced into a situation he never wanted. However, once the child exists, the father's responsibilities extend beyond his initial wishes. So, while his actions might be understandable from his perspective, they could still be considered morally wrong because they impact the child's well-being. \n\nI need to weigh both sides. The woman's manipulation and mental health issues are factors, but the author isn't without fault. He didn't take precautions, and his refusal to engage with the child now is harming the child. So, despite the complexities, the author is likely in the wrong because he's cutting off a child from his father, which affects the child's life negatively. However, the situation is nuanced, and there's no simple right or wrong answer. But based on general moral standards, parental involvement is usually expected unless there's abuse or neglect, which isn't mentioned here. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
