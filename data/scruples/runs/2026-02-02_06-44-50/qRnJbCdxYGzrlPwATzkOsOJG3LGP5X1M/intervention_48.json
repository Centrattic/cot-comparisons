C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a guy who broke up with his pregnant girlfriend. They were in a relationship 5 years ago in high school, which is now past. The girlfriend had a tough upbringing, and her family is very religious. She has bipolar disorder, which made her moods erratic. She wanted to get married and have a family, but when the author didn't propose, she started panicking. They were sexually active without using condoms, even though she was on birth control. Then she got diagnosed with PCOS, making her less likely to conceive, which upset her. But later, she found out she was pregnant and tried to hide it. The author convinced her to get an abortion, but on the day they were going to the airport, her cat was hit by the car, and they took that as a sign from God to keep the baby. So she changed her mind, the author broke up with her, and now the kid is 5, and he's not involved.\n\nThe author says he's been paying child support and his parents see the child, but he hasn't had contact. He feels guilty when he hears the kid says his daddy doesn't play with him, but he still thinks he was wronged because she was selfish and he wasn't ready for a child. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the key points here: The author was in a relationship where the girlfriend got pregnant and tried to manipulate the situation by hiding the pregnancy and then using a \"miracle\" with the cat's death to decide against the abortion. The author had initially convinced her to have the abortion but then she changed her mind. He broke up with her, refused to be involved, but pays child support. The main issue is his refusal to maintain a relationship with his son and the emotional impact on the child.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the author is paying child support, so he's fulfilling his obligations. But morally, did he have a right to abandon the child? The author claims he was coerced into the situation and the girlfriend was deceptive. However, he also didn't use protection despite being on birth control. The girlfriend's mental health is a factor, but she made the choice to have the baby after the abortion was arranged. The author's stance is that he never wanted a child and that the girlfriend was selfish, but by not having contact, he's contributing to the child's lack of a father figure.\n\nIn many societies, parental responsibility is considered important regardless of the circumstances of the child's conception. Even if the author didn't want to have a child, once the child is born, there's an expectation to be involved in the child's life. The fact that he hasn't had contact, despite being able to see the child, might be seen as neglecting his responsibilities. The child's statement about not playing with his daddy adds a layer of guilt here. The author's argument about feeling wronged and not wanting to validate the girlfriend's actions might not mitigate the harm to the child. So, while the situation is complex, the author's refusal to engage with his son could be seen as morally wrong, especially since the child is now old enough to be affected by the absence of a father. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
