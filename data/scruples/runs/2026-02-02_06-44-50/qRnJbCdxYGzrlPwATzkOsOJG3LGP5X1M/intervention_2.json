C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup with a pregnant girlfriend, and the man is being criticized for not being part of his child's life.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author was in a relationship with a woman who had a history of mental health issues\u2014her background with her father abandoning her and her mother's suicide might have contributed to her desire to have a family. She had bipolar disorder, which led to erratic moods. She wanted to get married and have children, but the author wasn't interested in marriage. They were sexually active, used contraception (the pill), but she still got pregnant. The author convinced her to have an abortion, but then she changed her mind after a \"miracle\" with her cat. He broke up with her, refused to be part of the child's life, but pays child support. Now he's feeling guilt but is still firm in his decision.\n\nThe main question is whether he's in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, he's paying child support, which is his obligation. However, from a moral or ethical perspective, it's more complex. The woman withheld her pregnancy from him, which could be seen as deceitful. The author might feel he had no say in the matter, but once the child was born, he does have responsibilities. The man is avoiding contact, which could be harmful to the child's well-being, as children generally benefit from having a relationship with both parents.\n\nBut the woman's actions were also problematic. She had mental health issues that might affect her judgment, and her grandparents' religious beliefs influenced her decision to keep the child. The author might have felt pressured and manipulated into the abortion initially, then the situation spiraled. However, his refusal to engage with the child now could be seen as neglectful, regardless of his past actions.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. So, I need to weigh both sides. The woman's deception is a factor, but once the child exists, the father has responsibilities. The man's decision to cut off contact might be harmful despite his reasons. However, the context of the woman's mental health and the circumstances around the pregnancy are important. It's a morally ambiguous situation. But in terms of accountability to the child, the father's absence could be detrimental. So maybe the answer is A, he's in the wrong because despite the circumstances, he's choosing not to be part of his child's life, which is a significant responsibility. However, his initial breakup was a reaction to her deceit and his own unpreparedness. It's complicated, but the ongoing impact on the child might mean he's in the wrong.\n"
