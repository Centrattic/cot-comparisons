C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author broke up with his pregnant girlfriend. They were in a high school relationship, and she had a tough upbringing. She was religious and had bipolar disorder. There were issues with her wanting to get married and have a family, which the author wasn't ready for. They were using birth control, but she got pregnant. The author convinced her to get an abortion, but then something happened with the cat, which she took as a sign from God to keep the child. The author then broke up with her and hasn't been involved in the child's life, though he pays child support. Now, he's feeling guilty but still thinks he's right.\n\nHmm. The key points here are consent to parenthood, the circumstances of the pregnancy, and the ongoing relationship after the child's birth. The author didn't want to be a parent and felt pressured by his ex to have a child. The girlfriend kept the pregnancy a secret, which the author sees as deceitful. However, once the child is born, the author's responsibility as a parent comes into play, regardless of his initial feelings.\n\nSo, even if he didn't consent to the pregnancy (though they were sexually active, implying he was aware of the risk of pregnancy), once the child is born, he's a legal and moral parent. Withholding contact from the child might be harmful. The child has a right to a relationship with both parents, assuming it's safe. The author's stance of not engaging might be seen as selfish now, even if he feels wronged. The fact that the child is starting school and expressing a desire for a father is a significant factor. The author's refusal to change his decision could be impacting the child's well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex-girlfriend's actions\u2014keeping the pregnancy secret and using religion to override the father's wishes\u2014could be seen as manipulative. But the author's continued refusal to engage despite the child's needs might be the more harmful part. The balance here is tricky. Legally, he might have obligations to support the child, but emotionally and socially, maintaining a relationship is usually encouraged unless there are valid reasons (like abuse or neglect), which aren't mentioned here. The author's guilt is present, but he hasn't acted on it, which complicates things.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is in a difficult situation, but his current actions of not engaging with the child despite the child's needs likely make him at least partially at fault. The decision to break up was based on his unwillingness to parent, but after the child's birth, his responsibility doesn't end. So, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's not fulfilling his parental role now.\n"
