C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend and refusing to be part of his child's life. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts presented. The author had a relationship with a girl, C, who had a tough upbringing and mental health issues (bipolar disorder). She became pregnant after an abortion was planned but then a \"miracle\" (the cat dying) made her decide to keep the baby. The author felt pressured, didn't want kids, and broke up with her. Now he's facing social judgment and feels guilty but is firm in his decision.\n\nSo, from a legal standpoint, the author is paying child support, which he's obligated to do. That's a given. But the moral or ethical question is about his refusal to have a relationship with his child. In many places, parents have a legal and moral duty to their children, regardless of the circumstances of the pregnancy. The child doesn't have a say in how they were conceived, so the author's refusal to be involved could be seen as neglectful. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions\u2014deceiving him about the pregnancy and using her religious beliefs to justify keeping the child\u2014might be a factor. But even if she was manipulative, the author is now the legal father, and cutting off contact could harm the child's well-being. The child's best interest is usually the priority in such cases. \n\nThe author mentions guilt when hearing the child say, \"my daddy doesn't play with me.\" That's a red flag. While he feels wronged, the child's emotional needs are significant. Society often emphasizes the importance of a father's role, so his stance might be viewed as selfish now. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author was coerced into an unwanted pregnancy and felt he had no choice. But once the child is born, the responsibilities as a parent typically can't be avoided. The initial decision not to proceed with the abortion (he booked the trip, but she changed her mind) complicates things. He had a chance to be involved but chose not to. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author's actions could be seen as prioritizing his own desires over his child's needs. Even if the pregnancy was unwanted, parenthood brings responsibilities. The fact that he's paying child support shows he's aware of financial obligations, but emotional and parental involvement is another layer. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author is likely in the wrong morally and ethically, even if legally he's meeting his obligations. The child deserves a relationship with both parents if possible, and the author's refusal might be more harmful in the long run. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
