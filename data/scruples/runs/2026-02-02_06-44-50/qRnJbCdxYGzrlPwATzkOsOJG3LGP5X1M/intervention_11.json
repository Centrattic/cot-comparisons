C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup after a girlfriend, who had a tough upbringing and mental health issues, became pregnant. The author wanted an abortion, but after some events, she decided to keep the child, leading to the breakup and the author not being involved in the child's life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author felt pressured into a situation he wasn't ready for and wanted an abortion. However, once the child was born, he chose not to be involved beyond child support. On the other hand, the girlfriend had a history of mental health issues, which might have influenced her decisions, but she ended up carrying the child to term. \n\nThe author's main argument is that he wasn't given a choice and that she was selfish. But once the child is born, the responsibility of parenthood is a shared one. Even if the initial decision was contentious, the child's well-being now becomes a priority. The author's refusal to engage with the child, despite knowing the impact on the child's life, raises ethical concerns. \n\nAlso, the part about the cat being run over and interpreted as a miracle is a key point. The author might feel betrayed because the plans for the abortion were abruptly stopped by what the family perceived as a divine sign. However, that doesn't absolve him of responsibility. \n\nChild support is a legal obligation, but emotional and parental involvement is crucial. The fact that the child is now expressing a desire to have a relationship with a father figure suggests that the author's current stance might be harming the child. \n\nWhile the author's perspective is valid in terms of feeling forced into a situation, the consequences of his decision affect more than just him and the ex-girlfriend\u2014they affect the child. Society often views parental responsibility as a duty regardless of the circumstances leading to the child's birth. So, even if the initial circumstances were contentious, the author's refusal to be involved after the child's birth could be seen as neglectful.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex-girlfriend's actions in hiding the pregnancy and the mental health aspects complicate things. But the author's choice to cut off contact entirely might be where he's in the wrong. Balancing both sides, the author's responsibility as a parent, post-birth, seems to be the key issue here. Therefore, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's avoiding his parental duties despite the circumstances.\n"
