C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a breakup after a girlfriend, who had a history of mental health issues and a strong desire for a family, got pregnant. The author tried to convince her to have an abortion, but when she changed her mind after a cat was run over (seen as a miracle), he broke up with her and hasn't engaged with the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The woman had bipolar disorder and a traumatic past, which might have influenced her decisions. The author didn't use protection despite her being on birth control, which led to pregnancy. He tried to push for an abortion, but she changed her mind. Now he refuses to have contact with his child, causing guilt but also standing by his decision.\n\nLegally, in many places, both parents have rights and responsibilities. The author is paying child support, which is a legal obligation, but not engaging emotionally or socially with the child might be a different issue. Ethically, the father's responsibility extends beyond financial support. The child's well-being is a factor here, especially when the child is starting school and expressing feelings about not having a relationship with his father.\n\nThe author's argument is that he wasn't ready for a child and felt disrespected because she wanted to have the baby against his wishes. However, once a child is born, there are societal and moral expectations around a parent's role. The author's stance might be seen as neglectful, even if he feels justified. The child's emotional development could be affected by the lack of a father figure.\n\nMental health aspects are also important. The woman's bipolar disorder and traumatic background might have impacted her judgment in wanting the child. But the author also made a decision to not be involved, which affects the child's life. The question is whether his decision is morally right despite his reasons.\n\nConsidering all this, it seems like the author is in the wrong (A) because he's refusing to be a part of his child's life, which could harm the child. His reasons might be valid in his perspective, but the consequences on the child's well-being are significant. The woman's actions might be flawed, but the father's ongoing refusal to engage is also a problem.\n"
