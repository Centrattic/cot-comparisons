All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to his mom.\n\nFirst, the friend made a cruel joke targeting the author's girlfriend who is undergoing chemo and has serious health issues. The joke was about her weight gain due to medical conditions, which is insensitive and hurtful. The author confronts the friend, but he dismisses it, showing no remorse.\n\nNow, the author is considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom as a form of retaliation. The key points here are the intent behind the action and the context. The friend's comments were clearly inconsiderate and crossed a line, especially given the girlfriend's health struggles. The author is frustrated and feels that the friend isn't taking responsibility.\n\nHowever, sending the screenshot to his mom could be seen as escalating the conflict and involving others unnecessarily. The author is using a method they know the friend uses to hide things from his parents, which might be a form of payback. But is it justified? While the friend was at fault, the author's action could be seen as a breach of privacy or an overreaction. It might not be the right approach to take, even if the friend was wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to protect their girlfriend's dignity and hold the friend accountable. They might feel that their other friends aren't supporting them properly. But using the screenshot as a weapon could lead to more conflict and might not resolve the issue constructively.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author is reacting to a hurtful situation but their method of retaliation could be problematic. However, the friend's initial comments were clearly the wrong, so the author's intent isn't malicious. It's a tricky situation where both sides have issues, but the author's action might not be entirely justified. However, the core issue is the friend's inconsiderate remarks. The author's action is a response to that, but it's not the best way to handle it. Still, the main wrongdoer here is the friend. So, maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong, but their action isn't ideal. Wait, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is retaliating in a way that's not morally high, but given the context, maybe they aren't in the wrong. Hmm. The options are A or B. The user wants a simple A or B. The key is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's action is a private matter of sending a screenshot, but it's a breach of their friend's privacy. However, given the severity of the friend's comments, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. So, the answer is B.\n"
