All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend making a derogatory comment about the author's girlfriend who's undergoing chemo, leading to the author considering sending a screenshot of the comment to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The friend made a joke targeting the girlfriend's weight, which is a sensitive issue because she's dealing with serious health issues. The author felt wronged and is considering escalating the situation by informing the friend's parent, which could be seen as a retaliatory action. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing so.\n\nThe friend's comment is clearly inconsiderate and cruel, especially given the girlfriend's medical conditions. The author's response was to confront the friend, who then showed no remorse. The author is in a tough spot, wanting to address the hurtful comment without escalating publicly. Sending the screenshot to the friend's mom is a private action that could lead to the friend's parent being aware of his behavior, which might be a way to hold him accountable without public shaming in front of peers.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's intention is to address the hurtful comment and prevent future instances, then it's a form of seeking justice. However, the method of using a screenshot without the friend's knowledge might be seen as underhanded. But given the context of the friend's lack of remorse and the group's usual behavior of helping him hide things, the author might feel that this is the only way to make the friend's parent aware. \n\nBut is the author justified in taking this action? It's a moral dilemma. On one hand, the friend's comment was malicious. On the other, the author is taking a private matter and involving the friend's family, which could be seen as crossing a line. However, considering the health context and the friend's dismissiveness, the author's actions might be seen as a necessary step to protect their girlfriend's well-being and to address the friend's inappropriate behavior.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the friend's comment was offensive and the author is taking action against someone who showed no remorse, especially in a context where the health of a loved one is at stake. The method might be questionable, but the intent is to address a serious issue.\n"
