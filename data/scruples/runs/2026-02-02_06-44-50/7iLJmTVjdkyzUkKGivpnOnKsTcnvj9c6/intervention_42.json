All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person in the scenario) is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to his mom. \n\nFirst, the friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend, who's going through chemo and has serious health issues. The author confronts the friend, but the friend doesn't apologize and instead doubles down with a comment about the girlfriend's weight and health issues. The author then considers sending a screenshot of that offensive message to the friend's mom.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the friend's offensive remarks, the author's response, and the act of sending the screenshot to the parent. \n\nThe friend's comments are clearly hurtful and inappropriate, especially given the girlfriend's health condition. The author tried to address it directly but the friend didn't take it seriously. The author's decision to involve the friend's mom could be seen as a way to make the friend realize the severity of his actions. However, sharing the screenshot without consent might be considered a violation of privacy or an escalation.\n\nBut considering the context, the author's girlfriend is in a vulnerable state, and the friend showed no remorse. The author might feel that this is a way to protect their girlfriend and make the friend understand the gravity. However, using the friend's parent as a mediator could be appropriate if done respectfully. But sending a screenshot without explanation might come off as vindictive rather than constructive. \n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to weigh the options. The friend's behavior was wrong, but the author's response also has consequences. Sending the screenshot to the mom could be seen as a justified action to highlight the friend's inappropriate behavior, especially if the mom can intervene. However, it's also possible that the author is overstepping by sharing private messages without consent.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between defending someone and respecting privacy. The author might be trying to protect their girlfriend, but the method could be problematic. Depending on the intent\u2014if it's to inform the parent of the issue versus to humiliate the friend\u2014the judgment could vary. Since the friend showed no remorse, the author might see this as the only way to get through to him. But it's still a contentious action. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's action is proportionate. The friend's comments were extremely hurtful, and the author's response might be an attempt to seek accountability. However, involving the parent without perhaps first discussing with the friend's mom or using a more formal approach could be seen as a breach of trust. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for not addressing it through proper channels first. But given the friend's lack of remorse, it's understandable. \n\nBut legally and socially, sharing someone's private messages without consent is generally not acceptable, even if the content is offensive. So, the author is in the wrong for violating the friend's privacy, even if the intent was to correct his behavior. The correct approach might have been to report the behavior to a trusted adult or authority figure within appropriate boundaries.\n"
