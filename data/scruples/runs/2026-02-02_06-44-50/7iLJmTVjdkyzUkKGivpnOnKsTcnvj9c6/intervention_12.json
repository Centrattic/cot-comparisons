All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about someone in a group chat where a friend made an offensive comment about their girlfriend who's going through chemo. The author then sends a screenshot of that comment to the friend's mom. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend's comment was about the author's girlfriend, who has a serious medical condition. The author confronted the friend, who dismissed it. Then the author decides to send the screenshot to the friend's mom instead of escalating it in front of friends. The author is considering whether this is the right move.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. To determine this, I need to consider the context: the friend made a cruel joke about someone with a medical condition. The author's girlfriend is vulnerable here. The friend showed no remorse. The author is trying to avoid escalating things publicly but is considering private action. \n\nIs sending the screenshot to the friend's mom justified? Well, the friend's comment was inappropriate and hurtful. The author might feel that confronting the friend wasn't enough, so taking this step is a way to hold the friend accountable. However, sending it to the mom might be seen as a betrayal of trust, especially if the group often hides things from parents. On the other hand, the original joke was harmful, and the author is protecting their girlfriend's dignity. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If the friend's comment was malicious and the author is trying to address it, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, using the friend's mom as a way to escalate could be problematic. The author might have other options, like addressing it directly with the friend again or involving others. But given the friend's response (\"Don't talk shit then\") and lack of remorse, maybe the author felt they had no other choice.\n\nAlternatively, the author could be seen as overstepping by involving the parents without giving the friend another chance to apologize. But the context is important here: the joke was about a sensitive medical issue, which is more serious. In that case, the author's actions might be justified as protecting their girlfriend and holding the friend accountable. \n\nI think the answer hinges on the severity of the joke and the friend's response. Since the girlfriend's health is a critical factor, the joke was particularly harmful. The author might feel that sending the screenshot to the mom was a necessary step to make the friend understand the seriousness. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
