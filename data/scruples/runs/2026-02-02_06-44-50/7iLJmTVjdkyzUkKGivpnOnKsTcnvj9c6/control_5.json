All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend making a joke about his girlfriend undergoing chemo to his mom. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend made a hurtful comment about the author's girlfriend, who is very sick. The author tried to respond in the group chat, but the friend didn't back down. The author is considering escalating by sending the screenshot to the friend's mom, which might be a private matter.\n\nThe key points here are: the friend's comment was not just a joke but targeted the author's girlfriend's medical condition. The author's girlfriend is dealing with serious health issues, so the comment was insensitive and potentially harmful. The friend shows no remorse, which might justify the author feeling the need to take action. \n\nHowever, the author is considering using a screenshot as evidence to report the friend's behavior to his mom. This could be seen as a form of retaliation or a way to get the friend in trouble. But given the context of the friend's cruel comment, the author might feel it's necessary to hold him accountable. \n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to defend their girlfriend and address the friend's inappropriate behavior. On the other hand, escalating the issue by involving the friend's mother without giving him another chance to apologize might be seen as harsh. But considering the friend's dismissive response (\"Don't talk shit then\"), the author might believe that the friend isn't taking the issue seriously. \n\nAlso, the group chat friends aren't taking sides, so the author might feel isolated. The author mentions that they often help this friend hide things from his parents, implying a history of leniency. This might make the author's action of finally confronting by sending the screenshot a justified response to the friend's ongoing insensitivity. \n\nSo, balancing the friend's harmful comment and the lack of remorse against the author's action of seeking accountability through involving the friend's mother, it's possible that the author isn't in the wrong. The action, while maybe not perfect, is a response to a serious offense. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
