All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend making a hurtful comment about the author's girlfriend who's undergoing chemo, leading the author to consider sending a screenshot of that comment to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend said something very derogatory about the author's girlfriend, who is very sick. The author responded in a somewhat teasing manner about the friend's appearance, which might have been a mistake. Then the friend escalated with a comment targeting the girlfriend's medical condition. The author is upset and considering taking a screenshot to the friend's mom to address the issue without escalating in front of others.\n\nNow, considering right and wrong here. The friend's comments are clearly inappropriate and cruel. The author's reaction is to send the screenshot to the friend's mom. Is that justified? On one hand, the friend's remarks are inexcusable, and the author has the right to defend their girlfriend. On the other hand, sending it to the mom might be seen as an underhanded move, possibly violating the friend's privacy or bypassing direct confrontation. However, the author's intention is to address the friend's behavior, which is harmful and lacking in empathy.\n\nThe author might be in the right if their intention is to correct the friend and possibly prevent future hurtful comments. However, if the author is acting out of revenge or without considering the consequences, that could be problematic. The key here is the intent and the context. Since the friend showed no remorse and the comment was about a serious medical issue, the author's action could be seen as a necessary step to address the behavior.\n\nBut some might argue that the author should handle it directly with the friend first. However, the scenario mentions that the friend isn't showing any remorse, so direct confrontation might not work. The author might feel that involving the friend's mom is the only way to make the friend understand the severity of his actions. In that case, sending the screenshot could be justified as a form of holding the friend accountable, especially if the mom is in a position to influence him.\n\nOn another note, the author initially responded with a joke about the friend's weight, which might have contributed to the escalation. But the friend overstepped by targeting the girlfriend's health. The author's response to the friend downplaying the situation with \"Don't talk shit then\" is a clear indication that the friend isn't taking it seriously. \n\nIn terms of moral judgment, the line between right and wrong can be blurry. The friend's actions are clearly wrong, but the author's method of addressing it could be seen as underhanded. However, given the context of the friend's lack of remorse and the serious nature of the comments, some might argue that the author is justified in taking this step to protect their girlfriend and hold the friend accountable.\n\nSo, considering all angles, I think the answer is that the author is not in the wrong (B). The friend's behavior was inexcusable, and the author's action is an attempt to address it when direct methods aren't working. While the method might be questionable, the intent is to stop harmful behavior, which is a valid concern.\n"
