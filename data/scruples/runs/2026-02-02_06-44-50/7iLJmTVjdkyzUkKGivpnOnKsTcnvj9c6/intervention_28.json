All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wants to send a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to his mom is in the wrong. The friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend, who is going through a serious illness. The author is considering taking this action to address the friend's insensitive comments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's comment was clearly hurtful and inconsiderate, especially given the girlfriend's medical condition. The author tried to address it directly, but the friend didn't take it seriously. The author is frustrated and wants to escalate the situation by involving the friend's mom, possibly to hold him accountable.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to do this. On one hand, the friend's behavior was unacceptable, and the author has a right to feel upset. On the other hand, sending a screenshot to the friend's mom without giving him a chance to explain or apologize might be seen as an overreaction. It could violate the friend's privacy and potentially damage relationships. However, the friend showed no remorse, so the author might believe this is necessary to teach a lesson.\n\nBut here's the thing: the author is using a method that's underhanded. They mention that they and their friends help this kid hide things from his parents, implying that they've been complicit in covering for him before. By suddenly sending a screenshot to his mom, they might be breaking that pattern of complicity. However, this action could be seen as retaliating in a sneaky way rather than addressing the issue openly. \n\nThe key points are the intent and the method. The author's intent is to confront the friend's hurtful behavior, which is justified. However, the method involves deception and manipulation (hiding the truth from the friend's mom until after the fact), which could be considered wrong. \n\nMoreover, involving a parent without the friend's knowledge might not be the most effective way to resolve the conflict. It could lead to more tension without giving the friend a chance to reflect. The author's friends are also unsure how to act, so maybe a group discussion would be better than individual action.\n\nIn conclusion, while the friend's comments were despicable, the author's method of addressing it by secretly informing the parent might not be the most right approach. It's possible the author is in the wrong because they're using a covert and potentially harmful strategy instead of a more direct, honest approach. But there's also an argument that the friend's behavior was so bad that the author has a right to act. However, considering the usual dynamics of their group and the author's own tactics, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
