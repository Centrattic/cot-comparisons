All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's friend made a really hurtful comment about his girlfriend, who's going through chemo and has a medical condition causing her to be swollen. The friend said something like \"fuck your 400-pound fatass girlfriend,\" which was clearly targeting her health issues. The author responded by telling him he went too far, but the friend didn't apologize. Now the author is considering sending a screenshot of the conversation to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The friend's comment was cruel and targeted a vulnerable person with a serious medical condition. The author's girlfriend is dealing with lupus, kidney problems, and the side effects of chemo, which makes the joke not just about weight but about her health. That's really insensitive. The friend showed no remorse when confronted, which is a problem.\n\nThe author is considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom. Is that wrong? Well, the friend is 18, so they're an adult. However, the author is 18 as well, so they're both young. The group chat context means that the original message was in a public space among friends. The author might be using this method because they don't want to escalate things directly or in front of other friends. \n\nBut is sending a screenshot to the friend's mom appropriate? On one hand, the author is trying to address a hurtful comment that was made in a private group chat. The friend isn't taking responsibility, so the author might feel like they need to involve the friend's parent to make them understand the seriousness. On the other hand, the author is using a tactic that might be considered a form of revenge or escalation. The friend might have a right to privacy, and the author is exposing the conversation without consent. \n\nHowever, considering the context of the friend's comment being about a person with a serious illness, the comment was not just a joke but a cruel attack. The author might be justified in wanting to hold the friend accountable, especially since the friend dismissed their feelings and showed no remorse. The parent might not know about the behavior and could intervene to correct it. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of peer pressure and the group dynamic. The other friends didn't take a side, so the author might be feeling isolated. The alternative the author mentions is bringing up the friend's real dad leaving him, which could be more personal and hurtful. Comparing both options, sending a screenshot to the mom might be a less personal way to address the issue, though still risky.\n\nIn terms of morality, it's a gray area. The author is trying to protect their girlfriend and stand up for her, which is commendable. But using a screenshot as a tool might be seen as crossing a line, even if the original comment was offensive. However, given the severity of the friend's comment and the lack of remorse, some might argue that the author is justified in wanting to involve the parent to make a point. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the friend's comment was clearly in the wrong, then the author's action could be seen as a necessary step to address that. However, the method of addressing it by involving the parent without the friend's consent might still be questionable. But given the context, it's a difficult situation where the author is trying to correct a serious wrong. So the answer might be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
