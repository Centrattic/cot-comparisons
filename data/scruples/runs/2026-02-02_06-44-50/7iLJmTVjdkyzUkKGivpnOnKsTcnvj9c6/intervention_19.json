All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend making a cruel comment about the author's girlfriend, who is going through serious health issues, and the author considering sending a screenshot of that comment to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The friend made a joke that was clearly hurtful, targeting the author's girlfriend's health condition. The author tried to respond in a light-hearted way, but the friend escalated it with a comment that's offensive and insensitive. The author then confronts the friend, who dismisses it by saying \"Don't talk shit then,\" showing no remorse.\n\nNow, the author is considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom as a form of retaliation. The question is whether this action is wrong. \n\nOn one hand, the friend's comment was inexcusable, especially given the girlfriend's medical situation. The author has every right to be upset and to want to address the issue. However, taking the screenshot to the friend's mom could be seen as a form of escalating the conflict in a way that might be considered underhanded or a breach of trust, especially since the group often hides things from parents. \n\nBut considering the context\u2014the friend's comment was malicious and the author's girlfriend is in a vulnerable state\u2014maybe the author has valid reasons for wanting to protect their partner and hold the friend accountable. The author is also in a group chat where others aren't taking sides, which might leave them feeling isolated. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the action is taken to address a serious insult against someone's partner, maybe not. But there's also the aspect of privacy and how it's handled. The author is using a personal attack (revealing the friend's mom) as a way to make a point. That could be seen as a form of bullying, which would be wrong. \n\nHowever, given the friend's lack of remorse and the severity of the comment, the author might feel that this is a necessary step to prevent future harm and to show that such behavior isn't acceptable. It's a tough call. \n\nIn terms of morality, the friend's initial actions were clearly wrong. The author's response is a form of accountability. But using a parent might be crossing a line if it's not done with a genuine intention to resolve the issue rather than just retaliate. \n\nI think the key here is intent. If the author is trying to inform the parent so that the friend can be educated and held accountable, maybe it's justified. But if it's just to humiliate the friend, then it's not. The situation isn't clear on the exact intent, but given the context, the author's actions could be seen as a last resort when other methods (like confronting the friend directly) haven't worked. \n\nGiven all that, I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong, but it's a close call. The friend's behavior was inexcusable, and the author might feel they have no other options. However, the method of taking it to the mom might be problematic. But in the context of the friend's actions and the lack of support from others, the author might be justified in their actions.\n"
