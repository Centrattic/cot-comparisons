All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wants to send a screenshot of their friend's offensive comments to his mom is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: the friend made a cruel joke about the girlfriend's medical condition. The girlfriend is undergoing chemo and has severe health issues, leading to her being swollen and bloated. The friend's comment was about her weight, which is directly related to her health struggles. The person in question is upset and considering sending this screenshot to the friend's mom as a form of confrontation.\n\nNow, considering the context. The friend showed no remorse after being confronted. The person writing the post is trying to find a way to address this without escalating things in front of other friends. They mention that the friends usually help the other kid hide things from his parents. The alternative they mention is bringing up a sensitive topic about his real dad, which could be even more hurtful.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the friend's original comment was clearly hurtful and inconsiderate. The person sending the screenshot is trying to hold the friend accountable. However, there's a debate about the right approach. In some cultures or contexts, informing a parent might be seen as tattling, but given the severity of the comment and the lack of remorse, it's a way to address the issue. The alternative of bringing up the friend's personal issues could be more damaging.\n\nBut the key here is whether the action of sending the screenshot is wrong. The person is retaliating with evidence of the friend's own actions. The friend's comment was about the girlfriend's health, which is a sensitive topic. The person is using a tool (the screenshot) that the friend used to hide from his parents. The group often helps the friend hide things, but this time the friend's behavior crossed a line.\n\nSo, considering all factors: the friend's comment was harmful and insensitive, the person is addressing it in a way that's consistent with the friend's own behavior (using the parents as leverage), and there's a lack of remorse from the friend. Therefore, the action might be justified as a form of accountability, even if it's not the most conventional approach. The main issue is whether the person is in the wrong for taking this step. Since the friend's actions were worse, and the person is trying to correct a harmful behavior, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong). But there's a nuance here. However, given the context of the friend's inconsiderate remark and the lack of resolution when addressed directly, the action might be justified.\n"
