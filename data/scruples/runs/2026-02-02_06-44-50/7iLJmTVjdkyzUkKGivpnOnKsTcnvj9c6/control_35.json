All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend making a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend who's undergoing chemo. The author considered sending a screenshot of the friend's comment to his mom. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend made a derogatory comment targeting the author's girlfriend's health issues. The author responded, and the friend escalated by making a joke about her weight, which is related to her medical condition. The friend showed no remorse, just dismissed it with \"Don't talk shit then.\" The author is frustrated and considering taking a screenshot to the friend's mom as a form of retaliation.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The friend's initial comment was clearly inappropriate and hurtful. The author's girlfriend is in a vulnerable state due to her illness, so the joke isn't just mean but also shows a lack of empathy. The author's reaction is understandable given the context. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for considering sending the screenshot. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Sending the screenshot could be seen as a form of revenge, but it's also a way to hold the friend accountable, especially since he showed no remorse. The author mentions that others in the group chat haven't taken sides, indicating they might not be aware of the severity of the comment. \n\nHowever, sharing private messages without consent can be problematic. It might escalate the conflict and could lead to unintended consequences for both parties. The author's intention is to prevent further hurt and maybe teach the friend a lesson. But is this the right approach? \n\nIn terms of morality, while the friend's actions were clearly wrong, the author's response of involving the friend's mom without giving him a chance to apologize first could be seen as harsh. There's a middle ground, like confronting the friend directly or seeking mediation. \n\nBut given the context\u2014that the friend has no remorse and the author wants to prevent future incidents\u2014some might argue that the ends justify the means. Others might say the author should handle it privately first. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the action is about protecting his girlfriend and addressing a serious issue, maybe not. But if the action is a personal vendetta, perhaps. However, considering the friend's lack of empathy and the seriousness of the comments, the author's actions might be justified. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the friend's behavior was inexcusable and the author is trying to address a harmful situation. But there are nuances here. However, based on the options given, B seems more appropriate.\n"
