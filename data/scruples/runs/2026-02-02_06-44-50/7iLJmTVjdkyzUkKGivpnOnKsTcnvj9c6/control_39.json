All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author who wants to screenshot a friend's offensive comment to his mom is in the wrong. The friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend's health issues. The author is considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom to address the situation without escalating it publicly.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The friend's comment was about the author's girlfriend, who is dealing with serious health problems. The friend's remark was not only rude but also targeted a vulnerable aspect of the girlfriend's condition. The author confronted the friend, who dismissed it by saying \"Don't talk shit then,\" showing no remorse. \n\nNow, the author is considering sending a private message to the friend's mom. Is this the wrong move? Well, sharing someone's private messages without their consent can be seen as violating privacy. However, the friend's comment was in a group chat, which is a public space for the participants. Taking a screenshot of a public message in that context might not be a breach of privacy. But sending it to the person's mom is a different matter. It's a form of escalation and could be considered a betrayal of trust if the group chat was meant to be private among friends.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's comment was hurtful and inconsiderate. The author might feel that the friend isn't taking the issue seriously. By showing the mom, the author is trying to make the friend understand the seriousness of his words through the parent. However, this approach might not be fair if the mom isn't aware of the context. The friend might spin the story, and the mom could misinterpret the situation. Also, the author is using this method to avoid confrontation in front of other friends, which could be a way to protect both sides from immediate conflict.\n\nBut is the author justified? The friend's comment was clearly inappropriate, but the author's response is to involve the parent, which isn't a typical way to handle such conflicts. Normally, addressing the friend directly or seeking mediation would be better. Sending the screenshot to the mom could be seen as a harsh measure, even if the original comment was offensive. The author might be acting out of anger and frustration, which could cloud judgment.\n\nHowever, considering the severity of the friend's comment and the lack of remorse, the author might feel that conventional methods aren't effective. The author also mentions that friends in the group chat haven't taken sides, indicating a lack of support. In that case, the author's actions might be a last resort to make the friend realize the impact of his words.\n\nSo, weighing the privacy violation against the friend's harmful comment, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. The friend's comment was inexcusable, but the author's response involves sharing private messages. However, since the comment was in a group chat, which is a shared space, taking a screenshot isn't inherently wrong. The act of sending it to the mom could be seen as a breach of trust, but given the context of the offensive message, it's a complex situation. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but it's a questionable action regardless.\n"
