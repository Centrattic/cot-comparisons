All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of a friend's offensive comment to his mom. The situation involves a friend making a derogatory remark about the author's girlfriend who is undergoing chemo. The author tried to confront the friend, but the friend dismissed it. Now, the author is considering escalating by sending the screenshot.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The friend made a cruel joke about the girlfriend's health, which is clearly inconsiderate and hurtful. The author's girlfriend is dealing with serious health issues, so the comment is not just a joke but a personal attack. The author was trying to defend their girlfriend and was met with no remorse from the friend. \n\nThe author's options are limited here. They could confront the friend again, but the friend isn't taking it seriously. The author feels that the friend is being disrespectful and doesn't want to escalate things in front of other friends who haven't taken a side. The idea of sending the screenshot to the friend's mom is presented as a way to address the behavior without public confrontation, but it's a private escalation. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for doing this? Well, the friend's behavior is definitely inappropriate. The author is trying to hold them accountable, and the action might be a form of seeking support from the parent. However, the method of addressing it by going to the parent might be seen as a breach of trust or privacy. But considering the context\u2014someone making a hurtful joke about a person's health\u2014many would argue that the author has valid reasons to involve the parent, especially if the friend isn't being responsible. \n\nThe friend's comment was cruel and dismissive of the girlfriend's serious health issues. The author is protecting their partner and addressing a harmful joke. The action of sharing the screenshot with the mom is a way to get the parent involved, which could be a necessary step if the friend isn't taking accountability. \n\nIn terms of morality, while it's not the most direct approach, the intent is to correct harmful behavior. The alternative of not doing anything might let the behavior go unchecked. Therefore, the author's action could be seen as justified given the circumstances. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
