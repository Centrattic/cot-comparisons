All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend making a derogatory comment about his girlfriend who is undergoing chemo. The author of the post is considering sending a screenshot of that comment to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the actions of both parties. The friend made a hurtful comment targeting the author's girlfriend, who is dealing with serious health issues. The author then considers sending this evidence to the friend's mother. The key here is whether the author's response is justified.\n\nThe friend's comment is clearly out of line, especially given the context of the girlfriend's medical condition. The author's reaction is to escalate the situation by involving the friend's parent, which could be seen as a form of retaliation. However, the friend showed no remorse and had no intention of apologizing, according to the author. \n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the friend's behavior was inappropriate and hurtful, so the author has valid reasons for being upset. On the other hand, sending the screenshot to the friend's mom might be considered a breach of privacy and could potentially escalate the conflict further. It could also be seen as a way to publicly shame the friend, which might not be the most constructive approach.\n\nHowever, the author's intent here is to address the friend's harmful comment, especially since the friend is unapologetic. The author might feel that involving a parent is necessary to hold the friend accountable, especially if the friend is a minor (as the author is 18, and the friend might be around the same age). But if the friend is also 18, then involving his mother might be a personal choice rather than a necessary step. \n\nConsidering the context\u2014serious health issues of the girlfriend, the friend's lack of remorse, and the potential for others in the group to take a side\u2014it's a complex situation. The author is trying to protect their girlfriend and address the friend's behavior. While the method of sending a screenshot to the mother could be seen as harsh, the underlying issue is the friend's toxic behavior. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author is justified in their response given the friend's actions and the lack of accountability. If the friend's actions were truly malicious and persistent, the author's response might be seen as a way to seek justice for their girlfriend. However, the method of escalation could be problematic. But considering the severity of the comment and the health context, the author might not be entirely at fault. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the friend's actions were inexcusable, and the author is responding to protect their girlfriend. However, some might argue that sending the screenshot is an overreaction. But given the circumstances, it's a difficult call. I'm leaning towards B.\n"
