All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author is in a group chat with friends talking about lacrosse. A friend says something offensive about the author's girlfriend, who's going through chemo and has lupus. The friend makes a comment about the girlfriend's weight, referencing her medical condition. The author responds by telling the friend he went too far, but the friend is dismissive. Now, the author is considering sending a screenshot of the friend's message to his mom, hence the question whether that's wrong.\n\nThe key here is understanding the context and the severity of the friend's comment. The girlfriend is dealing with serious health issues, which makes the joke particularly cruel. The friend's comment isn't just teasing; it's targeting a vulnerable individual's health condition. The author is trying to protect their girlfriend's feelings and stand up against the friend's insensitive remarks.\n\nNow, the author is contemplating escalating the situation by involving the friend's mom. On one hand, they might be justified in wanting to address the friend's behavior, especially if the friend shows no remorse. On the other hand, sending a screenshot could be seen as a privacy violation or an overreaction, depending on the intent.\n\nBut considering the context, the friend's actions were hurtful and the author's girlfriend is in a fragile state. The author's reaction is an attempt to hold the friend accountable, given that their friends aren't taking sides. The author might feel that this is the only way to make the friend understand the severity of his comments.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If we look at the friend's behavior first, it's clearly inappropriate. The author is reacting to that. However, the method of addressing it\u2014by sending a screenshot to the friend's mom\u2014could be problematic. It's an invasion of the friend's privacy and might not be the best way to handle it. But given the context of the friend's callousness and the potential seriousness of the comments, some might argue the author has valid reasons.\n\nIn terms of morality, there's a balance between defending a loved one and respecting others' privacy. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because the friend's actions were worse. But the author's action of sending the screenshot to the friend's mom is ethically questionable, regardless of the context. It's a form of escalation that could have consequences beyond the immediate issue.\n\nHowever, considering the harm caused by the friend's comments and the lack of remorse, the author's intent to address the issue might be justified. The answer could hinge on whether the author's action is considered a reasonable response to the friend's cruelty. If the friend's behavior is unrepentant and the author feels no other avenues are available, then the action might be seen as a last resort.\n\nBut generally, involving parents without the other person's consent can be seen as a violation of trust, even if the original offense was severe. So while the author might have valid grievances, the method of addressing it could put them in the wrong ethically.\n"
