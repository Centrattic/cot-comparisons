All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"What Would You Do\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author considering sending a screenshot of a friend making a cruel joke about his girlfriend's medical condition to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The friend made a comment targeting the author's girlfriend, who is going through serious health issues. The author is upset and considering taking action by contacting the friend's mom. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong for planning this.\n\nI should consider the context. The friend made a harmful joke about the girlfriend's appearance, which is a sensitive topic given her medical condition. The friend showed no remorse and even dismissed the author's concern. The author feels justified because the comment was cruel and targeted someone vulnerable.\n\nNow, the author's plan is to send a screenshot to the friend's mom. Is this the wrong thing to do? Well, escalating a conflict by involving parents might not be the best approach, but the initial comment was clearly inappropriate. The author is trying to address the situation, albeit in a way that could be seen as retaliatory. However, given the friend's lack of remorse, the author might feel that other avenues are closed. \n\nOn one hand, confronting the friend directly is usually better. On the other hand, the friend's comment was hurtful and the author's girlfriend is in a vulnerable state. The author's actions, while potentially unwise, stem from a place of defending their partner. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If the friend's actions were indeed cruel and the author is trying to hold them accountable, maybe not. However, involving the mother might not be the most constructive solution. The question is whether the author is wrong for taking that step. \n\nI think the key here is the motive. The author is trying to address a hurtful comment made by a friend. The method might be questionable, but the underlying issue is valid. So, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because the friend's actions were inappropriate, and the author is standing up for their girlfriend.\n"
