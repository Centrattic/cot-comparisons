All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is: the author's friend made a really hurtful comment about his girlfriend who's going through chemo and has health issues. The friend said something about her being fat and then insulted the author. The author then considers sending a screenshot of that comment to the friend's mom.\n\nHmm, the friend's comment was definitely inappropriate, especially targeting someone with serious health problems. The author's girlfriend is in a vulnerable situation, so making fun of her weight, especially when it's due to medical conditions, is pretty awful. The friend shows no remorse and even doubles down by saying \"Don't talk shit then.\" That's not a good sign.\n\nThe author is thinking about sending the screenshot to the friend's mom to maybe get the parents involved. He mentions that they usually help the friend hide things from his parents. The author is conflicted because he doesn't want to escalate things in front of other friends but is also angry. He even threatens to bring up the friend's real dad leaving him if he doesn't send the screenshot.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the friend's behavior was really harmful and cruel. On the other hand, sending the screenshot without the friend's consent could be a privacy violation. The author might be justified in wanting to hold his friend accountable, but the method of doing so by leaking the message to his mom could be considered a betrayal of trust. However, considering the severity of the friend's comments, maybe the author is trying to protect his girlfriend and seek justice. But is it the right way?\n\nIn some contexts, leaking someone's messages without their consent can be seen as a violation of privacy, even if the content is offensive. However, if the content involved harassment or bullying, especially targeting someone's health, it might be justified to report it. The line here is blurry. The author is trying to address a serious issue, but the method of doing so might not be ethical. So, is the author in the wrong for sending the screenshot? It's possible, but maybe not entirely, since the friend's actions were worse. But the act of sharing it without consent could still be problematic. I'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because even if the friend was wrong, sending the message to his mom without a clear justification (like reporting to authorities) could be seen as retaliatory and invasive. But depending on cultural or situational factors, maybe it's understandable. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong, so the answer might be A or B. I'm a bit torn, but I think the act of sending the screenshot without the friend's consent is a violation of privacy, so the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
