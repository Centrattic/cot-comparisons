All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend making a hurtful comment about the author's girlfriend, who's going through chemo and has lupus. The author is considering sending a screenshot of that comment to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's comment is clearly offensive, especially given the girlfriend's medical condition. The author felt that the friend crossed a line, and the friend didn't show remorse. The author is conflicted between escalating the situation by informing the friend's mom or keeping it within their group.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the key points here are intent and proportionality. The author's motivation is to confront the friend's inappropriate behavior, which was targeting someone vulnerable. However, sending a screenshot to the friend's mom without discussing it directly first could be seen as bypassing the friend and potentially escalating the conflict. It might also involve the friend's parent in a situation where they might not have been aware, which could have consequences for the friend's autonomy.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's comment was cruel and dismissive, with no remorse. The author is trying to protect their girlfriend and address the friend's behavior. The action of sending the screenshot is a form of taking the issue to the friend's parent, which could be seen as a last resort when direct communication failed. However, it's important to weigh whether this action is justified. Since the friend isn't showing any remorse and the comment was about a sensitive medical issue, the author's action might be considered a proportionate response to hold the friend accountable, especially if the friend's parents are in a position to address his behavior appropriately.\n\nBut there's another angle: the author bypassed the friend and went straight to his mom. That could be seen as not giving the friend a chance to apologize, though the friend didn't show remorse. Also, the author's friends are present in the group chat and haven't taken a side, indicating that the friend's behavior is out of line but the others aren't intervening. The author's action might be justified as self-advocacy for their girlfriend and addressing the friend's toxic behavior.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's action might not be wrong because the friend's comment was particularly cruel and the author is trying to address it. However, there's a nuance in how they approached it. But given the friend's lack of remorse and the sensitive nature of the comment, the author's action might be understandable, even if it's a gray area. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
