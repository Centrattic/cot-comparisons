All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about forwarding a screenshot of a friend making a hurtful comment about the author's girlfriend, who is undergoing chemo and has health issues, to the friend's mom. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key elements here. The friend made a cruel joke targeting the author's girlfriend's medical condition. The author confronts the friend, but the friend doesn't show remorse. The author is considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom to escalate the situation.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The friend's comment was clearly insensitive and hurtful, especially given the girlfriend's health struggles. The author's reaction is to take action without confronting the friend directly in front of others. \n\nHowever, sending the screenshot to the friend's mom could be seen as an aggressive move, possibly crossing a line. It might escalate the conflict beyond the friendship, involving family. But on the other hand, the friend showed no remorse, and the author might feel justified in seeking intervention from a parent, especially if the friend's behavior is harmful and needs to be addressed.\n\nBut then again, the author is using the friends' habit of hiding things from parents as a context. The author is aware that this might not be the most moral approach but feels it's necessary. The author's motivation is to protect their girlfriend and perhaps teach the friend a lesson. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The friend's behavior was definitely wrong, but the author's response could be seen as retaliatory. The key point is whether the author's action is justified. The friend's comment was about the girlfriend's health, which is a sensitive and hurtful topic. The author might feel that the friend's actions were so severe that involving a parent is necessary. However, sending the screenshot without the friend's knowledge could be seen as a breach of privacy or an overreaction, even if the intent is to correct the friend's behavior.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author should have addressed it directly with the friend first. They did confront him, but he dismissed it. Maybe the author should have sought support from mutual friends or another authority figure instead of the parent. Involving a parent might be a last resort, but it could damage relationships and create more conflict.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author's action is a response to a hurtful and dismissive friend. While the method of escalation to the parent is questionable, the underlying issue is the friend's cruel behavior. The author might not be in the wrong because they're standing up for their girlfriend and their own values, but the method could be seen as excessive. However, given the context of the friend's lack of remorse and the sensitive nature of the comments, the author's action might be seen as a justified attempt to intervene, even if it's not the most diplomatic approach.\n"
