All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author of the original post (OP) is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive comment to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend made a joke targeting the OP's girlfriend who's undergoing chemo and has a medical condition causing swelling. The friend's comment was not just a random joke but specifically mentioned her weight and used derogatory language. The OP tried to respond, but the friend doubled down with a comment that was cruel and insensitive. The OP then considered sending the screenshot to the friend's mom as a way to address the situation, since the friend showed no remorse.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the OP is in the wrong. The user thinks the OP is in the wrong but wants another opinion. Let me break it down.\n\nOn one hand, the friend's comment was clearly offensive and targeting someone with a serious medical condition. The OP's girlfriend is going through a lot, so the friend's remarks were not just mean but also took advantage of her vulnerable situation. The OP tried to address it directly but didn't get a positive response. The friend's lack of remorse might make the OP feel that more drastic action is needed.\n\nOn the other hand, retaliating by sending the screenshot to the friend's mom could be seen as an escalation. It's a public shaming tactic and might not be the best approach. However, considering the context\u2014how the friend's comments were targeting a vulnerable person and the friend's refusal to acknowledge wrongdoing\u2014maybe the OP is justified in trying to make the friend face consequences.\n\nBut here's the thing: the OP's method of addressing the issue is questionable. Instead of confronting the friend privately or seeking support from mutual friends, they chose to inform the friend's parent. This could damage relationships and might not lead to a resolution. However, given the severity of the comments and the friend's non-apology, the OP might feel that this is a necessary step to protect their girlfriend and maybe teach the friend a lesson.\n\nAnother angle is the moral aspect. The user mentioned that they know it's not the most moral thing to do, but they're trying to avoid escalating things in front of other friends. The OP's friends aren't taking sides, which adds to the pressure. The OP's intent is to protect their girlfriend and address the friend's behavior, which is a valid concern.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the line is blurry. The friend's comments were clearly wrong, and the OP's response, while harsh, is in reaction to that. However, bypassing the friend and going straight to their mom might not be the right approach. It's possible that the OP could have sought another form of resolution first, like involving a teacher or a mutual authority figure if the friend is a minor. Since the OP is 18, the friend might also be an adult, but the context isn't clear. If the friend is a minor, the parent's involvement is more appropriate, but the method of informing them without the friend's knowledge is problematic.\n\nIn conclusion, while the friend's behavior was inexcusable, the OP's response might not be the best approach. However, given the circumstances, the OP's intention is to address a serious issue. The answer might hinge on whether the action was proportionate and the best way to handle the situation. But ultimately, the author's action is a form of retaliation, which could be seen as wrong regardless of the provocation.\n"
