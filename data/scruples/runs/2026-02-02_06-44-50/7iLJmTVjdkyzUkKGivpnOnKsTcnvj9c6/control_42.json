All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend making a hurtful comment about the author's girlfriend who's going through chemo. The author considered sending a screenshot of that comment to the friend's mom. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key elements here. The friend made a derogatory comment about the author's girlfriend's appearance, which is related to her medical condition. The author is upset and considering escalating the situation by showing the message to the friend's mom. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering this action.\n\nI should evaluate the moral aspects. The friend's comment is clearly inappropriate, especially given the girlfriend's health struggles. However, the author's response is to involve the friend's mother, which might be seen as a breach of privacy or an escalation. But the friend showed no remorse, so the author might feel justified.\n\nConsider the intent. The author wants to make the friend aware of the seriousness of their words. However, sending a screenshot without the friend's knowledge could be seen as a violation of trust, even if the comment was hurtful. On the other hand, the friend's comment was cruel and targeted a vulnerable person. The author's girlfriend is dealing with a serious illness, so the comment was particularly insensitive.\n\nAlso, the group of friends often hide things from the friend's parents, which might imply a culture of covering for him, adding another layer. The author might feel that this action is necessary to correct the friend's behavior since others aren't taking a side.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The act of sending the screenshot could be seen as a form of justified exposure of harmful behavior, especially if the friend is unrepentant. However, it's also a private matter, and the author's action might be considered an overreach. The key is whether the action is proportionate to the offense. The comment was extremely hurtful, so the author's intent to hold the friend accountable isn't unreasonable.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the action is considered an invasion of privacy or an inappropriate escalation, then A. If it's seen as standing up for their girlfriend and correcting the friend's behavior, then B. Given the context, the friend's comment was malicious and the author's girlfriend is in a vulnerable state. The author's action could be seen as trying to protect their girlfriend's dignity. However, the method (sending to the mom) is unconventional and might be seen as crossing a line. But given the severity of the comment, it's a tough call. The author's intent is to stop the friend from making such comments again. Since the friend showed no remorse, the author's action might be justified. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
