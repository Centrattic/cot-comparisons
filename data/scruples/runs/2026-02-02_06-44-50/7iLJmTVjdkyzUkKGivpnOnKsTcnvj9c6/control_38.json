All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a group chat where a friend makes a joke about the author's girlfriend who's going through chemo. The friend called the girlfriend a \"400 pound fatass\" when she's actually swollen due to her medical condition. The author is considering sending a screenshot of this message to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The friend's comment is clearly insensitive and cruel, targeting someone who's already vulnerable because of her health. The author is upset and wants to confront this by involving the friend's mom. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing that.\n\nThe possible answers are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). To decide, I should consider the ethics and appropriateness of the action. The friend made a hurtful joke about someone with a serious medical condition, showing no remorse. The author is trying to address the insult without escalating in front of friends, maybe to hold the friend accountable. \n\nHowever, sending the screenshot to the friend's mom could be seen as a form of revenge or escalation. Normally, the appropriate step might be to confront the friend directly, possibly with others, but not involve the parents unless there's a serious issue. The author mentions that they and their friends usually help the friend hide things, suggesting the friend might be someone with a history of issues. \n\nBut the comment in question is about someone's health, which is a sensitive topic. The friend's lack of apology adds to the problem. The author's intention is to show the friend's mom, which might be a way to make him face consequences. However, it's a private matter, and sharing without consent could be seen as a breach of privacy, even if the content is offensive. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend's comment was in a group chat, so maybe it's not entirely private. The author is trying to address a serious insult, so there's a moral argument for defending their girlfriend. The key here is whether the action was justified given the offensive nature of the comment. \n\nIn some perspectives, the author isn't in the wrong because the friend made a cruel joke about a vulnerable person, and the author is standing up for their partner. However, others might argue that taking the matter to the friend's mom is an overstep. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nBut considering the severity of the comment and the friend's lack of remorse, the author's action might be seen as a justified attempt to address the issue, especially if direct confrontation didn't work. So the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but I need to be careful here. Another angle is that the author should have addressed it within the group chat first, not escalated to the parent. \n\nHowever, the friend has shown no remorse, and the author is trying to prevent future incidents. So maybe B is the answer. The line between standing up for oneself and overstepping is thin here. The friend's comment is clearly in the wrong, so the author's action could be a necessary response to stop the bullying.\n"
