All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend making a hurtful comment about the author's girlfriend who's going through chemo and has a medical condition causing swelling. The author considered sending a screenshot of the friend's comment to his mom. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The friend made a cruel joke targeting the girlfriend's health. The author confronts him, but the friend shows no remorse. The author is considering informing the friend's mom, which could be seen as a form of retaliation or escalation, even if it's about a serious issue.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the friend's behavior was clearly inappropriate and harmful. The author's reaction is in response to that. However, sending a screenshot to the friend's mom might be crossing a line, even if it's to call out the friend's behavior. The author is using a method that bypasses direct confrontation and involves the friend's parents, which could be seen as a private matter being escalated. \n\nBut given the context of the friend's comment being about someone with a serious medical condition, the author's actions are motivated by defending their girlfriend. However, the method of confrontation (screenshot to mom) might be considered inappropriate because it's a form of snitching, which can damage friendships and isn't a direct approach. The author could have instead reported the behavior to the friend's parents through a more respectful and direct conversation, not anonymously via a screenshot. \n\nSo, while the friend's actions were clearly wrong, the author's method of handling it might be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the approach taken, even if the underlying issue is valid. Answer A.\n"
