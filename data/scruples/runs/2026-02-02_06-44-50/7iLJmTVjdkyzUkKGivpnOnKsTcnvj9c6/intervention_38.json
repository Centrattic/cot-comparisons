All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend making a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend, who's going through chemo and has significant health issues. The author is considering sending a screenshot of the friend's comment to his mom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend said something offensive, and the author is upset because it's targeting a vulnerable situation. The key points are the friend's comment, the girlfriend's medical condition, and the author's response.\n\nThe friend's comment was about the girlfriend's weight, which is due to medical issues from chemo, lupus, and kidney problems. The author responded by telling the friend to stop, but the friend dismissed it. Now, the author is considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for taking that action. On one hand, the friend made a hurtful comment, and the author is trying to hold him accountable. On the other hand, escalating by involving the friend's mom might be seen as crossing a line, even if the friend was in the wrong. \n\nFactors to consider: Was the friend's comment a legitimate joke or a harmful statement? The context shows it's clearly harmful given the girlfriend's health. The author's response is to involve the parent, which could be seen as a private form of punishment. But would that be justified? In some cases, calling out someone's inappropriate behavior is warranted, especially if they're being malicious. However, using a screenshot to involve a parent might be considered an overreaction, as it's not addressing the issue directly with the friend or seeking mediation.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they and their friends often hide things from the friend's parents. This might imply that the friend has a history of behavior that others don't confront. The author's action could be a way of breaking that cycle, but it's still a personal choice that could have consequences.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the friend's comment was clearly harmful and the author is trying to protect their girlfriend, maybe not. But the method of addressing it through the parent might be problematic. It's a nuanced situation. The answer depends on whether the action taken is proportional to the offense. If the friend showed no remorse and the author felt other methods weren't effective, sending the screenshot could be seen as a last resort. However, it's still a private action without confronting the person first, which might not be the best approach. But considering the severity of the comment, some might argue the author is justified.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I'm not entirely sure. The friend's comment was clearly inappropriate, and the author is trying to address it. The method might be questionable, but the intent is to hold the friend accountable. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong, but there's a case for both sides. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the action taken is considered an overreach or a privacy violation, then the answer would be A. If it's seen as a justified response to a harmful comment, then B. Given the context, the harm done by the friend's comment is significant, so the author's action could be seen as a way to protect their girlfriend and address the friend's lack of empathy. Therefore, maybe the author is not in the wrong.\n"
