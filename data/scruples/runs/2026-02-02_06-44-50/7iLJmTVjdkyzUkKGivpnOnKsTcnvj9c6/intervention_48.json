All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of a friend's offensive comment to his mom. \n\nFirst, the situation: The friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend, who's going through serious health issues. The author confronted the friend, who dismissed it and showed no remorse. The author is considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom as a form of retaliation.\n\nThe key points to consider are the friend's comments. He made a joke about the author's girlfriend's appearance, which is directly related to her chemo and health problems. This is not a light-hearted joke but a hurtful one targeting someone vulnerable. The friend's response of \"Don't talk shit then\" shows a lack of accountability.\n\nNow, the author's action is sending the screenshot to the friend's mom. They mention that they usually help him hide things, but this time they're considering a different approach. The question is whether this action is justified.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the friend's behavior is clearly inappropriate and harmful. The author's girlfriend's health issues are severe and personal. The friend's comments cross a line into being cruel and disrespectful. The author's intention is to hold the friend accountable, possibly to prevent further harm and to show the friend's family the inappropriateness of his behavior.\n\nHowever, sending the screenshot to his mom could be seen as an escalation. It's a breach of trust if the group chat is supposed to be private. But given the context\u2014the friend's lack of remorse, the severity of the comment, and the girlfriend's health\u2014it's an attempt to correct harmful behavior. The author might feel that confronting the friend directly wasn't effective, so they're using another method to address the issue.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. On one hand, the friend's actions were wrong, so the author is trying to address it. On the other hand, the author is taking the issue to the friend's parent without perhaps giving the friend a proper chance to apologize. However, since the friend showed no remorse, maybe the author's action is a necessary step to prevent ongoing harm.\n\nConsidering all that, the author is likely not in the wrong here. The friend's behavior was inexcusable, and the author is trying to protect their girlfriend's dignity. The action, while a bit underhanded, is motivated by a desire to correct a serious ethical violation. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
