All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wants to send a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to his mom is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend, who's going through chemo and has serious health issues. The author is upset and considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom as a form of retribution. The main question is whether this action is justified or if the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, starting with the friend's comment. The friend's statement about the girlfriend's weight, especially given her medical condition, is definitely inappropriate and shows a lack of empathy. The author has every right to be angry and feel that the friend crossed a line. The friend's response of \"Don't talk shit then\" indicates a lack of remorse, which adds to the author's frustration.\n\nNow, the author's plan is to send a screenshot of the comment to the friend's mom. The key issue here is whether this action is justified. On one hand, the comment was hurtful and targeted someone vulnerable. On the other hand, escalating the situation by involving the friend's parents could be seen as a form of retaliation, which might not be the best approach. However, considering the context\u2014especially the friend's lack of remorse and the fact that the group chat is a space where such comments can be hidden from parents\u2014it's a tricky situation.\n\nThe author is considering this action because they feel other friends aren't taking sides and they want to address the issue without a public confrontation in front of others. The alternative they mention is bringing up the friend's real dad leaving him, which could be more personal and potentially more hurtful.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, while the author is reacting to a hurtful comment, using the same tactic of exposing the friend's behavior to his mom (a move the friend's group usually helps him avoid) might be seen as using his own weapon against him. However, given the severity of the comment and the friend's lack of accountability, some might argue that the author is taking a stand for their girlfriend and protecting her dignity.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of whether the author should have addressed it differently first. Maybe confronting the friend directly, involving mutual friends to mediate, or seeking support through other channels could have been steps before escalating to informing a parent. However, given the friend's response indicating no remorse, the author might feel those steps are ineffective.\n\nSo, weighing the intentions and the context, the author's primary wrongdoing is the method of retaliation rather than the initial anger. But since the friend's actions were clearly in the wrong, the author's response, while not ideal, might be seen as a reaction to protect their girlfriend and address a toxic friend. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong, but it's a close call.\n"
