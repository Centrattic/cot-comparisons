All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive comments to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, the context: the friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend who's undergoing chemo, leading to her being swollen. The friend's response was dismissive, showing no remorse. The author is considering sending the screenshot to the mom to teach them a lesson, possibly as a form of retaliation.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The friend's comment was clearly hurtful and inconsiderate, especially given the girlfriend's health situation. The author tried to address it directly but the friend didn't take it seriously. Sending the screenshot to the mom could be seen as a way to hold the friend accountable, but it's a private matter and involves third parties (the mom and the group chat friends). \n\nHowever, the act of reporting the friend's behavior to his mom might be seen as a breach of trust, especially if they help each other hide things from parents. But the friend's actions were particularly insensitive. The author's intention is to stop the friend's hurtful behavior, which is understandable. \n\nOn the other hand, escalating the situation by involving the mom could have negative consequences, like a breakdown in trust or a more severe punishment. It's a gray area because while the friend was wrong, the author's method of addressing it might not be the most appropriate. \n\nBut considering the friend's lack of remorse and the severity of the comment, the author's action might be justified as a form of protection for their girlfriend and to address the toxic behavior. So the answer might lean towards not being in the wrong.\n"
