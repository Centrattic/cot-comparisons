All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's friend made a very hurtful comment about his girlfriend who's going through chemo. The friend said something about her being 400 pounds and fat, which is really insensitive given her medical condition. The author is considering sending a screenshot of that comment to the friend's mom. \n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's action is justified. The friend's comment was clearly cruel and targeted someone who's already suffering. The author is upset and feels like the friend has no remorse. The options are to either let it go or escalate by informing the friend's mom. \n\nNow, is sending the screenshot to the friend's mom wrong? Well, the friend's comment was inappropriate and hurtful. The author is trying to hold the friend accountable, maybe to make him understand the seriousness of his words. But does that give the author the right to go behind his back and tell his mom? \n\nOn one hand, the author has a valid reason to be angry. The friend's joke was about a very sensitive topic. The author might feel that confronting him directly wasn't enough, and since the friend is dismissive (\"Don't talk shit then\"), maybe the author thinks this is a way to get his mom involved to teach him a lesson. \n\nOn the other hand, sharing someone's private messages without their consent could be seen as a violation of privacy. Even if the comment was hurtful, the author is taking a step that could damage the friend's reputation and relationships. The friends in the group also seem hesitant to take sides, so the author might be acting out of frustration. \n\nBut considering the context\u2014someone making a joke about a person's illness and weight, which is extremely inconsiderate\u2014it's possible that the author's action is a form of justified retaliation. The line between right and wrong here is blurry. However, the core issue is whether the author's action is wrong. \n\nIf we look at the principles of privacy and respecting others' boundaries, sending a screenshot to the friend's mom might be seen as an overstep, even if the original comment was offensive. The author could have tried to address it through other means, like involving a mutual friend or maybe even a teacher or counselor. \n\nBut the friend showed no remorse, and the author might feel that escalating to his mom is the only way to make him understand the severity. In that case, the author might argue that it's not wrong because the friend's behavior was unacceptable. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author's action is a proportionate response. If the friend's comment was a serious violation, then the author's action might be seen as a way to hold him accountable, even if it's a private message. However, depending on the culture and the specific dynamics, it's possible that the author is overstepping. \n\nI think the key here is that the friend's comment was extremely inappropriate and targeted a vulnerable person. The author's action is a reaction to that. While it's not the most ethical approach, given the severity of the initial comment, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), but I'm a bit conflicted. However, considering the hurtful nature of the original message, the author's action could be seen as a justified attempt to correct the friend's behavior, even if the method is questionable.\n"
