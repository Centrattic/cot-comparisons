All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of a friend's offensive message to his mom. The situation involves the friend making a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend, who's dealing with serious health issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's comment was not only rude but also targeted someone with a medical condition, which is pretty harsh. The author tried to address it directly but was dismissed. Now, they're considering escalating by sending the evidence to the friend's mom. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the friend's behavior was unacceptable. Insensitive jokes about someone's health, especially when it's affecting their appearance, can be really hurtful. The author had a right to be upset. \n\nBut then, the author's response is to involve the friend's parent. That could be seen as crossing a line, even if the motive is to confront the problem. Telling a parent about a teenager's behavior might not be the best approach, especially if the friend has a history of hiding things from them. It's a form of escalation that could lead to bigger issues, like a parent-child conflict or even retaliation. \n\nThe author mentions that they want to avoid escalating things in front of friends, so they're trying to handle it discreetly. However, sending a screenshot to the parent might not be the most appropriate method. Maybe they should have talked to the friend more directly or involved a teacher or another authority figure. \n\nAlso, the author is considering using this information to get back at the friend for other reasons (like the real dad leaving him), which adds another layer of complexity. Personal vendettas shouldn't cloud judgment, especially when dealing with sensitive issues. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the friend definitely said something cruel. The author's intention is to hold the friend accountable, but the method might be problematic. However, given the emotional state and the nature of the offense, it's a tough call. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because they're using a private message (to the mom) as a tool for retaliation, which could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the friend's comment was wrong, escalating to a parent might not be the best solution, especially in a group chat context where privacy expectations vary. So, answer A.\n"
