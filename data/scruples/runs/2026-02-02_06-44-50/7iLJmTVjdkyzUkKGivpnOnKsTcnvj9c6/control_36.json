All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"What Would You Do\" scenario is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to his mom.\n\nFirst, the friend made a comment about the author's girlfriend, who has lupus and is undergoing chemo, which is really serious. The friend's joke is clearly insensitive and cruel, given the girlfriend's health issues. The author confronts the friend, but the friend doesn't take it seriously and even doubles down with a dismissive comment. \n\nNow, the author is considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom. The key points here are the intent and the context. The author's motivation is to address the friend's harmful behavior, especially since the friend shows no remorse. The author mentions they don't want to escalate things in front of other friends, so this action is a private one, targeting the friend's family. \n\nThe question is whether this action is wrong. On one hand, the friend's behavior was inconsiderate and offensive. On the other hand, involving the friend's mother might be seen as a breach of trust or privacy. However, given the context of the friend's comments being about a vulnerable person's health, the author's action could be seen as a justified attempt to hold the friend accountable, especially if other avenues (like confronting directly) haven't worked. The author is trying to protect their girlfriend from such comments and ensure the friend understands the severity of his words. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of privacy and the method of addressing the issue. However, in situations where someone is making fun of another's serious health issues, the line between personal privacy and harmful behavior might tip in favor of the author acting to stop the bullying. The friend's lack of remorse suggests that he might not learn from a direct confrontation, so escalating to involve a parent could be necessary.\n\nSo, considering the severity of the friend's comments and the author's intent to protect their girlfriend and address the friend's insensitivity, the author's action might be seen as a justified response. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
