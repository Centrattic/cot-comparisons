All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive comments to the friend's mom. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend made a really hurtful comment about the author's girlfriend, who is going through chemo and has severe health issues. The friend's comment was about her weight and implied something inappropriate. The author confronted him, but the friend showed no remorse. Now, the author is considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom to maybe get the friend in trouble but is unsure if they're doing the right thing.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the friend made a cruel joke about someone's health, the author tried to address it but it didn't work, and now the author is thinking of escalating by involving the friend's mom. \n\nI need to consider ethical and moral aspects. Was the friend's comment just a joke or was it genuinely harmful? Given that the girlfriend's health is a serious issue, the comment was clearly insensitive and hurtful. The friend showed no remorse, which is another red flag. \n\nThe author's options were to either let it go, confront the friend publicly, or take some other action. By sending the screenshot to the friend's mom, the author is taking a private matter and involving the parents. This could be seen as a form of retaliation or trying to use authority to make the friend stop. \n\nIs this the right approach? Well, it's a gray area. On one hand, the friend's comment was inexcusable, and the author had a right to be upset. On the other hand, involving the parents without giving the friend another chance to apologize or take responsibility might not be the best approach. Also, the author mentions that they help the friend hide things from his parents, which adds complexity. Maybe the friend's mom is aware of his behavior and this could lead to consequences for the friend, which might be warranted. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The initial action was to take a screenshot, which is just documenting the conversation. Sending it to the parent is the key action. Depending on the context, if the author's intention is to protect their girlfriend and hold the friend accountable, it might be justified. However, if it's done out of anger without considering the consequences, it could be seen as wrong. \n\nBut given the serious health issues of the girlfriend and the friend's lack of remorse, the author's actions might be seen as a necessary step to address the friend's harmful behavior. So the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. However, there's a possibility that the author could have handled it differently, but the question is whether they are in the wrong now. The harm was done by the friend's comment, so the author's response, while potentially harsh, is a reaction to that harm.\n"
