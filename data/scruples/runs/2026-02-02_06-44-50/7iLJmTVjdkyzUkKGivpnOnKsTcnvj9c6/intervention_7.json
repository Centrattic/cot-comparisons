All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend making a joke about their girlfriend's health to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, the context: The friend made a derogatory comment about the author's girlfriend, who is dealing with serious health issues (chemo, lupus, kidney problems leading to swelling). The friend's comment was cruel and insensitive. The author tried to reprimand him, but the friend showed no remorse. The author is considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom to expose the comment, possibly as a form of confrontation.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but wants my opinion.\n\nLooking at the situation, the friend's comment was definitely inappropriate and hurtful. The author's response was to try to address it directly, but when that didn't work, they considered involving the friend's mom. The key here is whether sending the screenshot crosses a line. \n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to hold their friend accountable for a cruel joke about a vulnerable person. On the other, exposing someone's private conversation without their consent can be seen as a violation of privacy, even if the friend's words were harmful. \n\nThe author might argue that the friend's comment was so egregious that it justified this action to get the friend's mom involved. However, escalating the situation by involving parents without first exhausting other options (like confronting the friend more firmly or seeking mediation from mutual friends) could be problematic. Also, using a screenshot might be seen as a form of doxxing or public shaming, which can have consequences beyond the original issue.\n\nBut considering the severity of the comment and the friend's lack of remorse, some might see the author's action as justified. The line between standing up for someone and taking things too far is thin here. However, the act of sending the screenshot to the friend's mom is a form of retaliation that could damage relationships and isn't resolving the issue constructively. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the friend's initial comment is clearly in the wrong. The author's action is a response, but whether it's wrong depends on the intent and the method. The author might not be in the wrong for trying to protect their girlfriend and hold the friend accountable, but the method might be questionable. However, given the context of the friend's callousness, the author's action could be seen as a necessary step to address the harm done.\n\nBut in terms of strict morality, the author's action of exposing the comment to the friend's mom could be considered wrong because it's a form of invasion of privacy and could be seen as an overreaction. However, given the circumstances, some might argue it's a justified response. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the ends justify the means. If the action is meant to correct the friend's behavior and support the girlfriend, maybe it's not entirely wrong. But the act itself is a breach of privacy. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong because while the friend's comment was bad, the response involves using a private conversation to shame someone, which can have unintended consequences and isn't a constructive resolution. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
