All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend making a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend, who's going through serious health issues. The author considered sending a screenshot of the comment to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the actions of both parties. The friend made a comment targeting the author's girlfriend's weight, which is a sensitive topic because she's dealing with chemo and lupus. That's pretty harsh. The friend's response when confronted was dismissive, saying \"Don't talk shit then,\" showing no remorse. \n\nThe author's reaction is to consider escalating the situation by sending the screenshot to the friend's mom. On one hand, the friend's comment is clearly hurtful and inconsiderate. On the other hand, the author's response might be seen as retaliatory or crossing a boundary by involving the friend's parent. \n\nBut the key point here is the context. The girlfriend's health condition makes the comment especially cruel. The friend's lack of empathy and refusal to acknowledge the mistake could justify the author wanting to address it. However, sending the screenshot to his mom might not be the best approach because it's behind-the-scenes and could come off as vindictive, even if the friend's actions were wrong. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The friend's behavior was clearly inappropriate, but the author's method of confrontation might not be the healthiest. The author might have options like confronting the friend directly again, seeking mediation, or cutting off the friendship if the friend doesn't change. Sending the screenshot could escalate things unnecessarily, but it's a reaction to a severe breach. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because the friend's actions were worse, but the author's response might not be the best. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best course of action. Since the friend's actions were offensive and the author is defending their partner, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
