All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to his mom. \n\nFirst, the context is important. The friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend, who's going through serious health issues. The author tried to confront him, but the friend dismissed it. Now the author is considering escalating by sending the screenshot to the friend's mom.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the friend's comments were clearly hurtful and insensitive, especially given the girlfriend's medical condition. The author might feel that the friend showed no remorse, so they're looking for a way to hold him accountable. Sending the screenshot to his mom could be seen as a form of confrontation, but it's behind his back.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's action might be seen as a breach of trust. Even though the original comment was wrong, retaliating by involving the friend's mom could be considered a violation of privacy. The author could have addressed the issue directly with the friend or sought support from mutual friends instead of going behind his back. It's possible that the author's action is an overreaction, even if the motive was to protect their girlfriend and hold the friend accountable.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they and their friends often hide things from the friend's parents. This habit might normalize such actions, but it doesn't justify the current situation. The key here is whether the action was proportionate. The friend's comment was inexcusable, but the author's response could damage relationships and create more conflict.\n\nSo, balancing the friend's wrongdoing and the author's method of response, the author's action might be seen as wrong because it's a form of passive-aggressive retaliation that could escalate the situation rather than resolve it. The right approach would have been to address it directly or involve the friend's mom through a more constructive channel, not as a personal attack.\n"
