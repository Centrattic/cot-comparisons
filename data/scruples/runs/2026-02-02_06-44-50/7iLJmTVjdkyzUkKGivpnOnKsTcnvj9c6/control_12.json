All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend making a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend who's undergoing chemotherapy, and the author is considering sending a screenshot of the friend's message to his mom.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the actions of both parties. The friend made a derogatory comment targeting the girlfriend's health condition. That's clearly inappropriate and hurtful. The author responded by telling the friend he went too far, which is a reasonable first step. But then the friend dismissed it with \"Don't talk shit then,\" showing no remorse. \n\nThe author is now considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom. The question is whether this action makes the author wrong. On one hand, the friend's comment was vile and targeted someone vulnerable. The author is trying to hold the friend accountable. But on the other hand, escalating by involving the friend's parents could be seen as a breach of privacy or a form of retaliation. \n\nHowever, considering the context: the joke was made in a group chat where others were present but didn't intervene. The author's girlfriend is dealing with a serious illness, and the comment was not just a joke but a cruel attack. The author's intent is to address the friend's lack of remorse and possibly prevent further harm. \n\nIn terms of morality, while the author's action might not be the most ethical, the friend's behavior was inexcusable. The author is in a difficult position, trying to protect their girlfriend and seek justice without further escalation. The friends in the group have enabled the friend by hiding things from his parents, so maybe this action is a necessary step. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're responding to a severe transgression. The main issue is the friend's comment, not the author's retaliation. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
