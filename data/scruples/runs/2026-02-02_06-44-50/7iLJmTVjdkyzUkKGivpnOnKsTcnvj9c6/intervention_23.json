All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's friend made a really hurtful comment about his girlfriend who's going through chemo and has medical issues. The author responded by sending a screenshot of that comment to the friend's mom. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's comment was clearly offensive, targeting the girlfriend's health condition. The author was upset and felt that the friend was being cruel. The friend then dismissed the concern, showing no remorse. The author's action was to escalate the situation by involving the friend's mom, which could be seen as a form of retaliation or a way to hold the friend accountable.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the initial insult was hurtful, the friend didn't apologize, and the author felt justified in taking action. The author mentions that they usually help the friend hide things from his parents, implying that this might be a breach of trust. However, the author is also protecting their girlfriend's well-being and is angry about the friend's lack of empathy.\n\nOn one hand, sending the screenshot to the mom could be seen as crossing a line, especially if the author is using the friend's personal information to shame or punish them. On the other hand, the friend's comment was insensitive, and the author might feel that this was necessary to address the harm done. It's a tough call because it's about the balance between standing up for someone you care about and respecting boundaries.\n\nThe author's intention matters. If the goal was to confront the friend's behavior and make him understand the severity of the comment, maybe this approach was a last resort. But using the friend's mom might not be the best way, as it could cause more conflict without resolving the issue. Also, the author's friends are hesitant, suggesting that this might not be the right group to handle the situation.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a gray area. The friend's comment was definitely wrong, but the author's response could be seen as a form of revenge, which isn't ideal. However, given the context of the friend being unrepentant and the girlfriend's serious health issues, some might argue that the author was justified. But generally, escalating by involving parents without trying to address the issue directly first could be problematic. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong, because even if the friend was at fault, the method of response was not the most appropriate. Alternatively, B could be the case if the author's action was a necessary step to hold the friend accountable. I'm leaning towards A because using the mom as a form of punishment without a direct discussion might be seen as crossing the line, but it's a close call."
