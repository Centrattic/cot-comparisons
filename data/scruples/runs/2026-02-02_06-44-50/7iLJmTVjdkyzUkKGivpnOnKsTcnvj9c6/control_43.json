All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"WIBTA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend making a cruel joke about his girlfriend who's going through chemo and has health issues. The author sent a screenshot of the friend's comment to his mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's comment was targeting the girlfriend's health condition, which is a very sensitive and serious matter. The author felt that the friend crossed a line and had no remorse. The friends in the group chat didn't take sides, which might indicate they didn't recognize the severity of the comment.\n\nThe author's response was to send a screenshot to the friend's mom. Now, the question is whether that's justified. On one hand, the friend's comment was insensitive and potentially harmful. The author likely wanted to hold the friend accountable and maybe get his mom involved to address the behavior. On the other hand, sending a screenshot without the friend's consent could be seen as a breach of privacy or an escalation. However, given the context of the abuse, some might argue it's a justified action to protect his girlfriend and confront the friend's behavior.\n\nI need to weigh the severity of the friend's actions against the author's response. The friend made a cruel joke about someone with serious health issues, which is hurtful and shows a lack of empathy. The author's act of sending the screenshot could be seen as a way to highlight the inappropriateness of the comment, especially since others didn't intervene. However, it's also possible that the author could have addressed it more privately first, but the friend showed no remorse, leaving the author feeling like other options weren't effective.\n\nIn moral terms, defending someone being bullied or targeted, especially when they're vulnerable, is often seen as the right thing to do. The author's action might be considered a necessary step to address the friend's harmful behavior, given the lack of support from others. So the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
