All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend making a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend who's undergoing chemo. The author is considering sending a screenshot of that comment to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend made a joke targeting the girlfriend's appearance, which is affected by her medical condition. The author responds by calling the friend out, but the friend dismisses it. The author is considering escalating by sharing the screenshot with the friend's mom, who might not be aware of the context.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for doing this. Let's think about the elements here. The friend's comment was clearly hurtful and targeted a vulnerable person. The author's girlfriend is in a fragile health condition, so this joke was particularly insensitive. The author is trying to protect their girlfriend and hold the friend accountable.\n\nNow, the author is considering taking a screenshot and sending it to the friend's mom. The potential consequences here are important. On one hand, the author is trying to address the friend's behavior, which was inexcusable. On the other hand, sharing the screenshot without context might not be the best approach. The mom might not understand the full situation, leading to misinterpretation or unnecessary conflict.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the friend was definitely in the wrong for making that comment. The author's intention is to confront the friend's behavior, albeit in a backhanded way. However, escalating the situation to the friend's mom without a clear plan or context could be problematic. The author might be trying to get revenge or teach the friend a lesson, which could be seen as a personal vendetta rather than a constructive resolution.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that other friends are present in the group chat but haven't taken a side yet. The author might be looking for support, but involving the mom could alienate the friend further without resolving the issue. The key here is whether the author's action is justified. Since the friend's comment was malicious and the author is trying to address it, but the method is questionable, it's a tricky situation.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's action might not be the most ethical. While the friend's behavior was bad, the author's response could be seen as retaliatory rather than seeking a constructive solution. The mother might not be aware of the context, so the screenshot could be misleading. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not handling it in a more responsible way, like talking directly to the friend or involving a mutual trusted adult instead of taking it to the mom.\n\nBut wait, the friend has shown no remorse, so the author might feel they have no other option. In that case, is it wrong for the author to take this step? The line between standing up for a loved one and overstepping can be blurry. The main issue is the method of confrontation. The author's action is a form of escalation, which can have unintended consequences. However, the initial harm from the friend's comment was clear. So, the author's action might be a response to a serious transgression, but the method is questionable. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they're using a potentially harmful method (sharing the screenshot) without considering the broader implications. Alternatively, if the friend truly has no remorse and the author is trying to protect their girlfriend, maybe the author isn't wrong. But I think the consensus would lean towards A, that the author is in the wrong because they're taking a personal and possibly unfair step without addressing it through more appropriate channels.\n"
