All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend making a hurtful comment about the author's girlfriend who's undergoing chemo and has health issues. The author is considering sending a screenshot of that comment to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend made a joke that targeted the author's girlfriend's appearance, which is related to her medical condition. The author is upset and considering taking this action as a form of retaliation. They mention that the friend has no remorse and the group chat friends aren't taking sides.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they're asking for an opinion. The options are A (Yes, the author is wrong) or B (No, the author is not wrong). \n\nI need to evaluate if sending the screenshot is justified. The friend's comment was cruel and potentially insensitive. However, the author's response is to go behind the friend's back and send the screenshot to his mom. This could be seen as a breach of privacy and possibly escalating the conflict. The author's friends aren't involved, and there's a mention of hiding things from the friend's parents. \n\nOn one hand, the friend's comment was inappropriate and hurtful. On the other hand, the author's action might be considered a violation of privacy and could damage relationships. The ethical dilemma here is about responding to cruelty in a way that might not be constructive. \n\nThe author might believe they're protecting their girlfriend by exposing the friend's cruelty, but using the friend's family could be seen as manipulative. The key points are the severity of the friend's comment and the appropriateness of the author's response. \n\nIn many cases, the right approach would be to confront the friend directly, perhaps with the help of friends, rather than involving parents without context. The author's action could lead to unintended consequences, like the friend feeling betrayed or the situation becoming more hostile. \n\nSo, while the friend's behavior is definitely wrong, the author's method of addressing it might not be the best approach. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for choosing to send the screenshot to the friend's mom instead of addressing it more directly and constructively.\n"
