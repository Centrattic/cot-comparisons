All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's friend made a joke in a group chat about the author's girlfriend who's undergoing chemo. The friend called the girlfriend a \"400 pound fatass,\" which is really hurtful given her medical condition. The author is considering sending a screenshot of this message to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's comment is clearly inappropriate and cruel, especially since the girlfriend has a serious illness. The author is upset and wants to take action. But the question is whether sending the screenshot is justified. \n\nOn one hand, the friend made a harmful joke about someone's health. That's pretty awful, and the author has a right to be angry. The friend didn't apologize and instead told the author to \"not talk shit,\" showing no remorse. The author might feel that exposing this behavior is necessary to hold the friend accountable.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is considering using a screenshot to get the friend's mom involved. This could be seen as a form of revenge or a way to bypass the friend's accountability by involving a parent. It might also escalate the situation in a way that's not productive, especially if the author's intention is to confront the friend. Additionally, the group chat dynamics are mentioned where others are hesitant to take sides, so the author might feel isolated and seeking support through this action.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. They might be thinking that the author should handle it directly with the friend instead of involving the parents. Also, the act of sending a screenshot without the friend's knowledge could be considered a breach of privacy or trust. However, some might argue that when someone is being malicious about a serious health issue, it's excusable to inform a parent to stop the harmful behavior.\n\nBut the key point is whether the author's action of sending the screenshot is justifiable. If the author's goal is to protect their girlfriend and stop the friend from making such comments, maybe there are other steps they could take first, like blocking the friend or confronting them more directly. Involving the friend's mom without giving them the chance to explain might not be the best approach, but given the friend's lack of remorse, perhaps it's a necessary step.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author's action might be seen as wrong because they're using a third party (the mom) to address the issue instead of dealing with it directly. However, if the friend isn't responsive to direct confrontation, then involving a parent could be a way to put pressure on them. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nAlso, the author's motivation matters. If they're trying to prevent further harm to their girlfriend, maybe it's more about standing up for her than about revenge. But sending the screenshot without the friend's awareness could be considered a violation of privacy. The friend might have made a joke, but the context here is a serious medical condition, so the joke isn't just a harmless comment. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author's action is proportionate and ethical. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but others might see it as a justified response to bullying. The answer depends on cultural and personal values. In many cases, addressing the issue directly is preferred, but if that's ineffective, involving a parent could be a last resort. However, the act of sending a screenshot without explanation might lead to misunderstandings. \n\nOverall, I think the author is not in the wrong because the friend's comment is deeply hurtful and the author is trying to protect their girlfriend. But they might not be the best approach. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong, not whether their action is the most effective. The friend's harmful behavior is the main issue here, so the author's response, while possibly impulsive, is a reaction to something that's clearly offensive.\n"
