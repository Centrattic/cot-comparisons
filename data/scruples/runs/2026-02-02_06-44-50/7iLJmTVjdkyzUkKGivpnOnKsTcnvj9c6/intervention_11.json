All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post (OP) is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to his mom. \n\nFirst, the situation: The friend made a cruel joke about the OP's girlfriend, who is going through chemo and has a serious medical condition. The friend's comment was not just rude but targeted a vulnerable person's health issues. The OP was angry and felt that the friend had no remorse. The OP considered sending the screenshot to the friend's mom to get her involved.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate if the OP is in the wrong. On one hand, the friend's behavior was clearly inappropriate and hurtful. Making fun of someone's medical condition, especially in a group chat, is bullying. The friend's lack of remorse makes it worse. The OP is trying to hold their friend accountable. \n\nOn the other hand, escalating the situation by involving the friend's mom without giving the friend a chance to address it directly might be seen as taking it too far. However, the friend has already shown that he doesn't take responsibility, so maybe the OP feels it's necessary to involve a parent. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the group chat. Other friends are present and haven't taken a side, so maybe the OP should address it within the group first. However, the OP's girlfriend's health is at stake, and the comment was particularly cruel. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the friend is definitely in the wrong for making the offensive comment. The OP's action of sending the screenshot is a form of retaliation. While it might not be the best approach, considering the friend's lack of remorse, maybe the OP is justified in trying to make the friend face consequences. \n\nBut is the OP in the wrong? Sending a private message to a parent without consent could be seen as a breach of trust. However, the friend's actions were harmful, so the OP might feel it's necessary. It's a gray area, but the main issue is the friend's behavior. The OP is trying to address a serious issue, so maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
