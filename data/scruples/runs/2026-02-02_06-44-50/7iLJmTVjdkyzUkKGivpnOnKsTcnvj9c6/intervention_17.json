All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves sending a screenshot of a friend's offensive comment to his mom.\n\nFirst, the friend made a hurtful joke about the author's girlfriend, who has serious health issues. The author tried to respond in a group chat but the friend escalated it with a comment about the girlfriend's weight due to her medical condition. The author then confronted the friend, who showed no remorse. The author is considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom to get him in trouble, possibly to retaliate.\n\nNow, considering right and wrong. The friend's initial comments were definitely inappropriate and hurtful. The author's girlfriend has a legitimate health issue, so making fun of her weight and appearance is cruel. The friend's response of \"Don't talk shit then\" shows a lack of empathy and accountability. \n\nThe author's response is to send the screenshot to the friend's mom. This could be seen as a form of revenge or trying to get the friend into trouble. However, the author is trying to hold the friend accountable for his actions, which might be justified given the friend's lack of remorse. But sending the screenshot without the friend's consent could be considered a privacy violation. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend's behavior was inexcusable. The joke was not only mean but targeted a vulnerable aspect of the girlfriend. The author is trying to protect his girlfriend's dignity and address the friend's toxic behavior. However, using a screenshot to report the friend might not be the most constructive way. It could escalate the situation or create more conflict, especially if the friend's mom reacts harshly. \n\nEthically, it's a gray area. The author had the right to be upset and address the friend's comments, but the method of addressing it might not be the best approach. There's a risk that this action could harm the friendship or cause unintended consequences for the friend. \n\nIn terms of moral judgment, if the friend's comments were genuinely harmful and he showed no remorse, the author has valid reasons to act. However, the author's approach might not be the most appropriate. A better solution might have been to confront the friend directly, block him, or seek support from mutual friends without involving the parents. \n\nSo, while the author isn't entirely in the wrong for wanting to protect his girlfriend and address the friend's behavior, the method of sending the screenshot could be problematic. The friend's actions were clearly wrong, but the author's response might be seen as excessive or retaliatory. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because the response could be considered an invasion of privacy or an overreaction, even if the intent was to stop the harmful behavior.\n"
