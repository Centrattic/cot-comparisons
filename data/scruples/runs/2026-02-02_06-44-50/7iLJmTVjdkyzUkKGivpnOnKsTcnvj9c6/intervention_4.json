All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of his friend's offensive comment to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author's friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend, who's going through chemo and has a serious medical condition. The friend's comment was about her weight and implied something about her appearance, which is clearly sensitive given her health. The author was upset and thought about sending the screenshot to the friend's mom to address the issue without escalating it in front of others.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author might be in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the friend's comment was hurtful and inconsiderate, especially given the girlfriend's medical struggles. The author's anger is understandable. On the other hand, sending the screenshot to the friend's mom without the friend's knowledge could be seen as a violation of privacy or an escalation, possibly damaging the relationship between the friends and their families.\n\nBut wait, the friend showed no remorse and the author felt like he wasn't being supported by the group. The author's action was a way to hold the friend accountable. However, is it the right approach? Sometimes, confronting someone directly or involving their parents isn't the best solution. But in this case, the friend's comment was targeting someone in a vulnerable situation. The author's girlfriend is dealing with serious health issues, so the comment crosses a line.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's action was a proportionate response. The friend's comment was inappropriate and hurtful. The author might not have other options if the friend refuses to take responsibility. Sending the screenshot to the mom could be seen as a way to make the friend understand the seriousness of his actions, especially from an authority figure. However, it's also possible that this action could cause unnecessary conflict, especially if the parent isn't aware of the context.\n\nBut considering the friend's lack of remorse and the author's intent to prevent future harm rather than just retaliate, maybe the action was justified. The author isn't trying to provoke a fight but to address a serious issue. The girlfriend's health is a critical factor here. The friend's joke was not just a joke but a cruel remark about a person in a vulnerable state. The author's girlfriend's well-being is at stake here.\n\nStill, some might argue that the author should have tried to handle it differently, like talking to the friend directly or involving someone else. But if the author felt that the friend wouldn't change his behavior and others weren't helping, then involving the parent might be a last resort. In that case, it's about protecting their girlfriend's dignity and health, which is more important than preserving the friendship with the friend.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the action might be justified as a response to a serious offense, even if it's not the most conventional approach. The author's primary concern is their girlfriend's well-being, and the friend's comment was a direct attack on someone in a compromised health state. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
