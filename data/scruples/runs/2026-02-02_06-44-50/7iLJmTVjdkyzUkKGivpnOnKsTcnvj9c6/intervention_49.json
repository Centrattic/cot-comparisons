All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend making a joke about their girlfriend undergoing chemo to his mom. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend made a derogatory comment about the author's girlfriend, who has a serious medical condition. The author responded by sending a screenshot to the friend's mom. The author is considering if they did the right thing.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. So, is the author justified in their actions? Let's break it down.\n\nThe friend said something extremely insensitive about the girlfriend's health issues. The author confronted him, but the friend didn't show remorse. The author felt their blood was boiling and didn't want to escalate things in front of others. They chose to send the screenshot to the friend's mom as a form of retaliation or to get him in trouble.\n\nNow, is this action wrong? Well, the friend's comment was definitely inappropriate and hurtful. The author had a right to be upset. However, sending a screenshot to the mother without considering the consequences could be seen as an overreaction. The friend might have a right to privacy in the group chat, and the author's action could be invading that privacy. Also, using a parent to discipline the friend might not be fair, especially if the friend was just being immature. \n\nBut on the other hand, the friend's comments were cruel and showed no empathy. The author's girlfriend is in a very vulnerable state, and the friend's remarks were not just a joke but a serious insult. The author might have felt that this was a way to hold the friend accountable without escalating the situation further in front of their friends.\n\nSo, there's a conflict between the right to privacy and the right to address harmful behavior. The author's action could be seen as crossing a line into revenge, which might not be the best approach. However, the original comment was clearly wrong, so the author's motivation is understandable. \n\nIn terms of moral judgment, sometimes people do things out of anger or to protect someone else, even if the method isn't the best. The question is whether the action is justified. The answer isn't black and white. The author might not be in the wrong because the friend's behavior was inexcusable, but the method of address might be questionable. However, the user initially thought the author is in the wrong (A), but maybe the answer is B because the friend's comments were so harmful. Hmm, but the question is about the author's action specifically. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is in the wrong because they took it to the friend's mom without trying to resolve it directly first. Or perhaps not, given the severity of the comments. It's tricky. I think the key point is whether the author's response was a proportionate reaction. Sending the screenshot to the mom might be a harsh response, but considering the friend's lack of remorse, maybe it's warranted. \n\nIn conclusion, I'm leaning towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because the friend's actions were inexcusable and the author felt they had to take action to protect their girlfriend's dignity and health.\n"
