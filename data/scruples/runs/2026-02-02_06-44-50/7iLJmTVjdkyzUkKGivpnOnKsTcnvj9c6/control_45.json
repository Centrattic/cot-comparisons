All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive comment to the friend's mom. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend who's undergoing chemo and has serious health issues. The author was in a group chat, and the friend said something about the girlfriend's weight, which was a sensitive topic due to her medical condition. The author responded in a playful way initially but then found out the friend crossed a line. The friend showed no remorse, so the author considered sending the screenshot to his mom to escalate things.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the friend made a hurtful comment about someone vulnerable, the author felt wronged and wanted to address it without a public confrontation, and the proposed action is to involve the friend's mother. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider the moral aspect. The friend's behavior was definitely inappropriate and harmful. However, the author's response of sending the screenshot to the mother could be seen as a private action to address the issue. On one hand, confronting the friend directly might be better, but if that's not effective, involving a parent could be a way to ensure the message is received. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author could have handled it differently, like talking to the friend privately or seeking mediation. But given that the friend showed no remorse and the situation was personal, the author's action might be justified as a form of protecting their girlfriend's feelings and standing up for what's right. \n\nAnother angle is that the author is using the same tactics as the group (helping hide things from parents) but is now using that knowledge for a different purpose. It's a bit of a moral dilemma, but the friend's comment was clearly in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's action, while perhaps not the best approach, is a response to an unjust situation. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
