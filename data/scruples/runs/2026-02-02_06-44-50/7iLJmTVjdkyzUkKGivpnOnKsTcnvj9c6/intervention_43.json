All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive comment to his mom. The friend made a joke about the author's girlfriend, who's going through chemo and has significant health issues. The author confronted the friend, who dismissed it, and now the author is considering taking the screenshot to his mom.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the friend's comment was inappropriate. The friend made a joke about the author's girlfriend's weight and appearance, knowing that she's suffering from health issues. That's definitely crossing a line. The friend shows no remorse, which is a problem.\n\nNow, the author's response is to send a screenshot to the friend's mom. The user's opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they want to know if that's accurate. \n\nOn one hand, the friend's comment was hurtful and insensitive. The author has a right to be upset. On the other, sending the screenshot to the friend's mom without his consent could be seen as a form of revenge or escalation. However, considering the context\u2014especially the friend's lack of remorse and the seriousness of the health issues\u2014the author's action might be more about protecting their girlfriend and holding the friend accountable.\n\nBut there's another angle: the author is using a method that could be considered underhanded, like hiding the friend's past misdeeds from parents. The author mentions that they usually help the friend avoid his parents' scrutiny. Now, they're doing the opposite, which might be a breach of trust. However, given the friend's behavior, the author might feel justified in exposing it.\n\nLegally, there's a line when it comes to sending someone's private messages without consent. But ethically, it's more nuanced. The friend's comments were harmful, and if the author's intent is to inform the mom about the son's inappropriate behavior, especially given the health context, it could be seen as a protective measure rather than just revenge.\n\nIn summary, while the author's action might not be the most diplomatic, the context of the friend's cruel comment and lack of remorse could justify it. However, the act of sharing a private message without consent is generally considered wrong. But considering the circumstances, some might argue it's understandable. However, the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the analysis.\n"
