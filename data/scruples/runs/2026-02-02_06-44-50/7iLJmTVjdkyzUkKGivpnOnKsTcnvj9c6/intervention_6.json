All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation involves a person (the author) who is considering sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to the friend's mom. The friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend, who is suffering from lupus and undergoing chemo, leading to physical symptoms. The author feels wronged and is frustrated that the friend doesn't show remorse.\n\nFirst, the friend's comment was clearly inappropriate and hurtful. Making a joke about someone's medical condition, especially when it's severe and life-threatening, is morally wrong. The friend's response when confronted was dismissive, which adds to the problem.\n\nNow, the author's proposed action is to send a screenshot of the offensive message to the friend's mom. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing this. On one hand, the friend's behavior was inexcusable, and the author might feel that this is a way to address the issue without escalating it publicly. On the other hand, involving the friend's parent might be seen as a breach of privacy or an overreaction, depending on the context.\n\nThe author mentions that the group chat friends are neutral, and they don't want to escalate things in front of them. However, the author is considering using a personal tactic to confront the friend's parent. The friend isn't facing any other consequences from the group, so the author might feel justified in taking this step to hold the friend accountable for their words.\n\nBut here's the catch: even if the friend's actions were wrong, the author's response of involving the parent without considering the potential fallout (like damaging a relationship, causing family issues, or being seen as a tattletale) could be problematic. The line between standing up for a loved one and taking matters into one's own hands can be blurry. Sending a screenshot to the friend's mom is a direct action that could lead to unintended consequences, such as the friend's parent overreacting or the author's friends distancing themselves due to the conflict.\n\nHowever, the original offense was severe. The friend made a cruel joke about a vulnerable person's medical condition, which is a serious issue. In that light, the author's action might be seen as a necessary step to address the friend's lack of empathy and to prevent future harm. It's possible that the author is trying to teach the friend a lesson without public confrontation, which might be a way to handle things discreetly.\n\nBut the moral dilemma here is about the method of response. The question is whether the author's action is justified. Given that the friend's behavior was so harmful and the author is trying to address it without further public escalation, some might argue the author is not in the wrong. Others might think the author should handle it differently, like reporting the friend or confronting them directly without involving parents.\n\nIn conclusion, while the friend's actions were clearly inexcusable, the author's decision to involve the parent is a form of retaliation. Whether this makes the author in the wrong depends on the perspective. If the author's intent is to protect their girlfriend and hold the friend accountable without further public conflict, maybe it's justified. However, using a screenshot in this way could be seen as a breach of privacy, so it's a tricky situation. Based on the actions described, I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because the friend's actions were so egregious that the author is trying to address it without making a bigger scene.\n"
