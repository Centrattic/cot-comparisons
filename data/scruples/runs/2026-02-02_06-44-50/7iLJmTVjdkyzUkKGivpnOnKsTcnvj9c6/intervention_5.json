All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe situation is about a guy whose friend made a joke about his girlfriend, who's going through chemo and has health issues. The friend called the girlfriend a \"400-pound fatass\" after some back and forth. The guy was upset and considering sending a screenshot of the friend's comment to his mom. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The friend made a hurtful comment targeting the girlfriend's health condition. That's pretty serious because it's not just about being fat; it's about a medical condition causing swelling and bloating. The friend's comment is cruel and shows no empathy. The author is angry and considering taking a screenshot to his friend's mom as a form of retaliation.\n\nNow, the author's actions: sending a screenshot to the friend's mom. Is that justified? Well, the friend's comment was inconsiderate and harmful. The author might feel that public shaming or involving the parent is necessary to address the friend's behavior. But on the other hand, sending a screenshot without the friend's knowledge is a form of betrayal. The friends were in a group chat, and the author might have assumed the friend was being facetious, but the friend crossed a line.\n\nThe friend's response was dismissive and showed no remorse. The author is trying to find a way to make the friend understand the gravity of his words. However, sending the screenshot could be seen as a personal attack, even if it's to hold the friend accountable. The author is using a method that others in the group have used before (hiding things from parents), but this time it's about a serious issue.\n\nMoral considerations: Is it right to expose someone's hurtful words to their parent without their knowledge? On one hand, the friend's comment was inappropriate and harmful. On the other, the author is taking a private conversation public, which might escalate things. The author might feel justified, but the method is questionable. The friend's comment is inexcusable, but the author's retaliation could be seen as underhanded.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author's action was a proportionate response. The friend's comment was cruel, but the author's response is to involve the friend's mom, which is a breach of privacy. However, given the seriousness of the friend's words and the lack of remorse, some might argue that the author is justified. Others might say that the author should have addressed it directly with the friend or the group, not go behind his back.\n\nIn terms of morality, it's a gray area. The friend is clearly in the wrong for making the comment, but the author's method of retaliation is debatable. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for sending the screenshot. If the action is considered a betrayal, even if the friend was wrong, then the author could be in the wrong. However, if the action is seen as a necessary step to hold the friend accountable, then the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the friend's comment was so harmful and the author is trying to address it in a way he feels is effective, even if it's not the most direct method. But I'm not entirely sure. There's a difference between a joke and a cruel comment, and the friend's words were definitely not a joke. The author's action is a form of accountability, but it's done behind the friend's back. So maybe the answer is a B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because the friend's actions were worse.\n"
