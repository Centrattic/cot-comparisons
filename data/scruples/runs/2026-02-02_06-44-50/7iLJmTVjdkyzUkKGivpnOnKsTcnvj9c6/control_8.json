All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wants to send a screenshot of their friend's offensive comments to his mom is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: The friend made a really hurtful comment about the author's girlfriend who's going through chemo and dealing with serious health issues. The author tried to respond playfully at first, but the friend crossed a line with a comment targeting the girlfriend's appearance due to her medical condition. The friend shows no remorse, just saying \"Don't talk shit then.\"\n\nThe author is considering sending a screenshot to the friend's mom as a way to address this without escalating in front of other friends. The friends aren't taking sides yet, and the author is frustrated. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing this.\n\nI need to consider if the author's action is justified. The friend's comment was clearly inappropriate and cruel, targeting someone with a serious illness. The author's response was to confront the friend, but when that didn't work, they're thinking of involving the friend's mom. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the friend made a harmful joke about someone vulnerable. The author is trying to hold their friend accountable. However, sending a screenshot to the friend's mom without their consent could be seen as a violation of privacy, even if it's to report the friend's behavior. \n\nBut the context here is important. The friend's comments were not just a joke; they were malicious and targeted someone's health condition. The author's girlfriend is in a very fragile state, and the friend's words could be seen as insensitive and cruel. The author might feel that the friend isn't taking responsibility, so involving the parent could be a way to make the friend understand the seriousness of his actions.\n\nOn the other hand, using the parent as a way to escalate might not be the best approach. It could lead to more conflict and might not resolve the issue constructively. However, given the severity of the comment and the lack of remorse from the friend, the author's actions could be seen as a last resort to address the problem, especially if their friends aren't supporting them.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The key points are the intent to address a serious issue and the method chosen. While the method might not be ideal, the intent is to correct harmful behavior. However, the act of sharing private messages without consent could be problematic. But given the context, the author's action might be justified as a defense of their girlfriend's dignity and to call out the friend's inappropriate behavior.\n"
