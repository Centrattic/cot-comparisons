All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the scenario) is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to his mom. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's friend made a comment in a group chat that was cruel and insensitive about the author's girlfriend, who's going through chemo and has serious health issues. The friend's comment was about her weight, which is a result of her medical condition. The author tried to confront the friend, but he dismissed it. Now, the author is considering sending a screenshot of that comment to the friend's mom.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to weigh the pros and cons. On one hand, the friend's comment was clearly hurtful and inappropriate, targeting someone with a serious illness. The author was defending their girlfriend, which is understandable. On the other hand, escalating the situation by involving the friend's mom might not be the best approach. It could lead to more conflict, and the author is using a form of retaliation by exposing the friend's private message without his consent. \n\nI should consider the context: the friend has no remorse, and the author feels that their other friends aren't taking sides. But is it right to involve the friend's mother? The author is using the threat of exposure to maybe get the friend to stop, but is that ethical? Also, the author mentions that they and others often hide things from the friend's parents, which might imply a culture of secrecy. \n\nThe key points here are the intent and the potential consequences. The author's intent is to stand up for their girlfriend and address the friend's cruel behavior. However, the method involves deception and sharing private messages without consent, which is a violation of privacy. Even if the friend's comment was wrong, the author's action could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nBut the friend's comment was extremely insensitive towards someone with a health condition. The author might feel that they have no other recourse, especially if confronting the friend didn't work. However, there are other ways to address this, like reporting the behavior to a teacher or authority figure, or cutting off the friendship. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's action is a form of taking a stand, but it's done in a way that could be seen as vindictive. The friend's comment was definitely wrong, but the author's response might not be the most constructive. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong because they used a private message against the friend without his consent, which is a violation of privacy, even if the friend's words were hurtful. The correct action would be to address the behavior through appropriate channels rather than personal retaliation.\n"
