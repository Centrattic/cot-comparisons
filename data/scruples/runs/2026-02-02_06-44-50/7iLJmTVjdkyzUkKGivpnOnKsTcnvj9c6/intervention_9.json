All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend making a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend who is undergoing chemo, leading to the author considering sending a screenshot of the comment to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, the friend's comment is clearly hurtful. The girlfriend's medical condition is serious, and the joke is not just about weight but mocks her health struggles. The friend shows no remorse, which adds to the problem. The author is upset and considering taking a screenshot to the friend's mom. \n\nThe author is conflicted because they're aware it's not the most moral choice but feel justified due to the friend's lack of empathy. Now, the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but they want to verify. \n\nI need to evaluate both sides. The author's actions might be seen as retaliatory, using a screenshot as a form of punishment. However, the context is a friend making a cruel joke about a vulnerable person. The author might feel they have no other recourse since their friend isn't apologizing. \n\nBut sending the screenshot to the friend's mom is a personal and invasive action. It could damage relationships and isn't a constructive way to address the issue. However, the initial joke was a severe transgression. The author's intent is to make the friend understand the severity of their words, maybe through consequences. \n\nIn terms of morality, while the friend was in the wrong for the comment, the author's response could be seen as using a private message against the friend. The rightness of the action depends on perspective. Some might argue the author is justified in protecting their girlfriend and holding the friend accountable, while others see it as an overreaction. \n\nThe user's own thought is that the author is in the wrong, but the situation is complex. The answer might hinge on whether the action is considered a justifiable response to a serious wrong versus an escalation that breaches trust or privacy.\n"
