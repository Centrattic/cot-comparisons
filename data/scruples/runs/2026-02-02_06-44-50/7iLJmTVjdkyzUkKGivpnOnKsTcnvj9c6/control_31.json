All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive comment to his mom.\n\nFirst, the friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend who's undergoing chemo and has serious health issues. The joke was about her weight, which is a sensitive topic given her medical condition. The friend showed no remorse and even dismissed the author's concern.\n\nThe author considered taking a screenshot to show the friend's mom. The friend's mom might not be aware of her son's behavior. On one hand, the author is trying to confront the friend's harmful comments, which is understandable given the context. On the other hand, the action could be seen as a private retaliation without giving the friend a chance to apologize or be addressed directly. \n\nHowever, the friend's comment was clearly inconsiderate and hurtful. The author's girlfriend is in a vulnerable state due to her illness. The friend's response of \"Don't talk shit then\" shows a lack of empathy. The author might feel that their usual attempts to address it aren't working, so they take a more drastic step. \n\nThe ethics here are tricky. Public shaming isn't usually advised, but the situation involves someone's health and a friend's inconsiderate remarks. The friends in the group chat are also there, but they haven't taken sides yet. The author might feel isolated and seeking support. \n\nBut sending a screenshot to his mom could be seen as crossing a line. It's a form of doxxing or exposing someone's behavior without consent. However, given the context of the girlfriend's medical issues and the friend's dismissiveness, some might argue the author had a valid reason to act. \n\nI need to weigh the severity of the offensive comment against the action taken. The friend's comment was deeply insensitive, and the author's action is a private matter between them and the friend's mom. But is the author in the wrong? If the friend's mom is unaware of his behavior, maybe the author is justified in informing her. However, using a screenshot without his consent might be considered a privacy violation. \n\nAlternatively, the author could have handled it differently, like confronting the friend directly or involving the group. But given the emotional state and the seriousness of the girlfriend's condition, the author's frustration is palpable. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might hinge on whether the action was a reasonable response to the friend's harmful behavior. Since the friend showed no remorse and the comment was about a vulnerable person, the author's action could be seen as justified. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
