All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to his mom. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The author's friend made a cruel joke about his girlfriend who's suffering from a serious illness. The friend was being really insensitive, making a joke about her weight gain due to her medical condition. The author tried to confront him but the friend showed no remorse. The author is considering taking this action to his mom as a form of retaliation because they don't want to escalate things in front of other friends.\n\nNow, I have to consider the ethical implications here. On one hand, the friend's comments were clearly inconsiderate and hurtful, especially considering the girlfriend's health struggles. The author had a right to be upset. On the other hand, the author is thinking about exposing this to the friend's mom, which could be seen as a breach of privacy or a form of revenge. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the friend's behavior was definitely wrong, but the author's response might not be justified. Instead of involving the friend's mom, maybe there are other ways to address the issue, like cutting off the friendship or confronting the friend more directly. However, the friend showed no remorse, so the author might feel like they have no other choice. \n\nBut sending a screenshot to the friend's mom could be considered a violation of privacy if it's not for a good reason. However, in this case, the friend's comment was about the author's significant other, which is a personal matter. The author might argue that they're protecting their girlfriend's feelings and holding their friend accountable. \n\nHowever, involving the friend's mom without his consent could be seen as crossing a line, even if the original comment was wrong. The author might not be in the wrong, but maybe there's a better way to handle it without escalating it to the parents. But given the context that the friend has no remorse and others aren't taking sides, the author might feel justified. \n\nHmm. It's a tough call. The friend's comments were unacceptable, and the author is upset. But using a screenshot as a weapon to involve parents might not be the best approach. However, the author's intent is to address the hurtful behavior, so maybe it's not entirely in the wrong. \n\nWait, but is there a moral obligation not to retaliate, even if the other person was wrong? The author is considering this as a way to teach the friend a lesson. But maybe the rightness of the action depends on whether the author had other options. Since they tried to confront him and it didn't work, maybe it's a last resort. \n\nIn terms of \"wrong,\" the author's action might not be morally wrong in this context, considering the severity of the friend's comments and the lack of remorse. However, it's a judgment call. The key is whether the action is proportionate. The friend made a cruel joke about a vulnerable person, so the author's response, while perhaps harsh, could be seen as a justified attempt to hold the friend accountable, especially if they're protecting their girlfriend. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. But I need to be careful. There's a difference between right and wrong here. The friend was in the wrong, but the author's response is a question. However, given the circumstances, the author's action might be understandable, even if not the best choice. So, the answer might be B.\n"
