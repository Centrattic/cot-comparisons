All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is whether the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to his mom. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend, who's going through chemo and has a serious medical condition. The friend's comment was not only rude but also showed a complete lack of empathy. The author confronted the friend, who didn't apologize and instead was dismissive. Now, the author is considering taking a screenshot of the message and sending it to the friend's mom.\n\nThe author is asking if they would be in the wrong (WIBTA) for doing this. The user's opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they're seeking others' thoughts. I need to determine if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nLet me break down the key points. The friend's comment was about the author's girlfriend's health issues, which is a sensitive topic. The friend's response was hurtful, and he didn't take responsibility. The author is considering informing the friend's mom as a form of retaliation. \n\nNow, thinking about the ethics here. The friend's behavior was clearly inappropriate and hurtful. However, the author's response is to go behind the friend's back and share the message with his mom. This could be seen as a violation of privacy, even if the friend said something wrong. The author is using a method that doesn't involve the friend's knowledge, which might be considered snitching or escalating the conflict in a personal way.\n\nOn one hand, the friend's joke was despicable and showed no empathy. The author has a right to be upset and wants to hold the friend accountable. But on the other hand, involving the friend's mother without giving him a chance to address it directly might be seen as taking the situation out of his hands and potentially causing more harm than good. The author could have other avenues, like talking to the friend directly, involving mutual friends, or maybe even contacting the girlfriend's support network. \n\nAnother angle: the author's friend has a history of hiding things from his parents, so the author knows this is a possible point to leverage. However, using that knowledge to send the screenshot might be seen as using a personal weakness for revenge rather than seeking a constructive resolution. \n\nIn terms of moral wrongdoing, the friend definitely acted inconsiderately, but the author's action could be seen as crossing a line by not addressing it with the friend first or through a more neutral party. The author might be justified in being upset, but the method of response could be problematic. \n\nTherefore, while the friend's actions were wrong, the author's actions might not be entirely justified because they're taking a private conversation public in a way that could damage the friend's relationships without giving him a chance to explain or apologize. The author's intention is to retaliate, which might not resolve the issue and could lead to more conflict.\n"
