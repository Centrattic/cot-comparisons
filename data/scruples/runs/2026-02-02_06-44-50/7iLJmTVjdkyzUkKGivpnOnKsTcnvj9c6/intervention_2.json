All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive comment to his mom. The friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend who's going through chemo and has health issues. The author tried to confront the friend, but the friend didn't take it seriously.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the friend's comment was hurtful towards someone with a serious illness. The author's action was to send the screenshot to the friend's mom. Now, the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The friend's joke was clearly inappropriate. Making fun of someone's health issues, especially in the context of someone very vulnerable like a partner undergoing chemo, is a serious matter. The author was defending their girlfriend by pointing out the comment, but the friend didn't back down. That shows the friend has no remorse, which is problematic.\n\nNow, the author's response was to involve the friend's mom. The group chat is a place where friends might make jokes, but when a joke crosses into cruelty, it's a different scenario. Sending the screenshot to the parent is a form of escalation. Normally, people might avoid involving parents unless it's a severe issue. But in this case, the friend's comment was not a joke but a harmful statement targeting someone in a vulnerable state.\n\nBut is the author justified in taking this step? On one hand, the friend's comment was offensive and hurtful. On the other hand, the author is bypassing the friend and going straight to the parent, which might be seen as a breach of trust or privacy. However, the friend's behavior was malicious and showed no respect for the girlfriend's health. The author's intent was to address the friend's behavior, perhaps to make the parent aware of how their child is acting.\n\nAnother angle: the author is trying to protect their girlfriend and stand up for her dignity. The friend's comment was not only mean but also ignorant of the medical context. The author felt that other friends weren't taking action, and this might be their way of seeking support or accountability.\n\nIn terms of morality, the friend's actions are clearly wrong. The author's action is a form of confrontation, but in a way that's not public shaming. It's a private communication to the parent. However, whether it's the right approach is debatable. Some might argue that the author should have talked to the friend directly or involved another friend first. But given that the friend showed no remorse, maybe the author felt that was the only option.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's action is a response to a hurtful comment. While the method might be questionable, the intent is to address something that needs to be addressed. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong. But I need to be careful here. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but maybe the context justifies it.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer might be B (No), because the author is defending their girlfriend against a cruel joke, and the friend's behavior was inexcusable. The author's action, while perhaps not the most diplomatic, is a reaction to a serious issue.\n"
