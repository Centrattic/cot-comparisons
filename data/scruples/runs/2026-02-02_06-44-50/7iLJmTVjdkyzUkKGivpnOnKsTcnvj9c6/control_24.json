All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to his mom. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend, who is going through chemo and has serious health issues. The author was upset and confrontational, but the friend dismissed it. The author is considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom to address the issue.\n\nNow, I should consider the ethics here. The friend's comment was clearly hurtful and insensitive. The author's girlfriend is in a vulnerable state, so making fun of her health is really wrong. The friend's response of \"Don't talk shit then\" shows a lack of remorse. \n\nBut the author's response is to send the screenshot to the friend's mom. Is that the right move? Well, sending private messages to someone's parent without their consent could be seen as a violation of privacy. Even if the friend said something wrong, the author is taking a form of revenge or escalation by involving the parent. The group chat might be a better place to address it, or maybe talking to the friend directly again. However, the author might feel that the friend isn't taking it seriously, so they're trying to get the parent involved to make an impact.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's behavior is inexcusable. Making fun of someone's health issues is a serious matter. The author is trying to protect their girlfriend's feelings and hold the friend accountable. But using a screenshot to the parent could be seen as crossing a line, even if the initial comment was wrong. It's a private conversation, and sharing that without consent might not be the best approach. \n\nHowever, considering the context, the author might feel that this is the only way to make the friend understand the severity of his words. The friend's lack of remorse is a problem. The author is in a tough spot because they don't want to escalate in front of friends, but the friend's comments were really hurtful. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, they're retaliating by sending a private message to the parent. On the other, the friend's comments were cruel and insensitive. But the act of sharing a private conversation without consent is generally considered wrong, regardless of the context. The author might have better options, like confronting the friend again, involving a mutual adult, or cutting off the friendship. \n\nTherefore, while the friend's behavior is clearly wrong, the author's action of sending the screenshot to the mom might not be the most appropriate response. So the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they're violating privacy, even if the initial situation was bad.\n"
