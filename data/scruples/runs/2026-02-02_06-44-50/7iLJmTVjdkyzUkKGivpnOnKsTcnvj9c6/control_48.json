All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend making a derogatory comment about the author's girlfriend who's undergoing chemo. The author is considering sending a screenshot of this comment to the friend's mom. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The friend made a joke targeting the author's girlfriend's health condition, specifically her weight due to medical issues. The author is upset and considering taking a screenshot to show the friend's mom. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing this.\n\nI should consider the context. The friend had no remorse, continued to be dismissive, and the comment was hurtful given the girlfriend's serious health struggles. The author is trying to address the issue without escalating it in front of others. The friends in the group chat haven't taken sides yet, and the author is using a tactic they've used before (helping the friend hide things), but now it's about a sensitive issue.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the friend's comment was clearly inappropriate and inconsiderate. The author is trying to hold the friend accountable, albeit through a private message to his mom instead of a public confrontation. The author's intent might be to teach the friend a lesson or make him realize the severity of his words. However, sending the screenshot to the friend's mom is a form of escalation and could be seen as a breach of privacy or trust. \n\nBut considering the context of the group chat\u2014where they usually hide things from parents\u2014this action is somewhat in line with their usual behavior. The author isn't spreading the comment publicly but is using a method they know the friend would take seriously. The friend's dismissive attitude (\"Don't talk shit then\") shows a lack of accountability, so the author's action might be a justified attempt to make the friend understand the impact of his words.\n\nHowever, there's a potential issue with the method. Instead of confronting the friend directly or talking to him privately first, the author is bypassing him by informing his mom. This could be seen as underhanded, but given the friend's previous behavior, the author might feel that a direct confrontation isn't effective. \n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because the friend's comment was hurtful and the author is trying to address it. The method might be questionable, but the intent is to stop further harm. The answer would depend on whether the action is seen as a reasonable response given the circumstances. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
