All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive comments to his mom. The situation involves the friend making a joke about the author's girlfriend, who's undergoing chemotherapy and has serious health issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's comment was about the girlfriend's weight due to medical conditions, which is clearly insensitive. The author tried to confront him, but the friend showed no remorse. The author is considering leaking the screenshot to the friend's mom as a form of retaliation. \n\nNow, the key points here: Was the friend's comment appropriate? No, it was cruel and taken advantage of someone's vulnerable situation. The author's response was to try to address it directly but didn't get anywhere. The plan to involve the friend's mom by sending a screenshot is a private matter. However, the author is in a group chat where others are present, and the friend's mom might not be aware of the context. \n\nIs the author justified? They might feel wronged, but sending the screenshot to his mom could be seen as escalating the conflict and potentially violating the friend's privacy. Even though the comment was hurtful, the method of retaliation could be problematic. The author's friends are caught in the middle, and the author is using a strategy that others might not agree with. \n\nBut then, considering the severity of the comment targeting someone with a medical condition, the author's intent is to hold the friend accountable. The friend's lack of remorse is a red flag. However, the act of sending the screenshot without the friend's knowledge is a breach of privacy. So, while the motive is understandable, the method might not be the right approach. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is in a tough spot. The friend was definitely in the wrong, but the author's action of sending the screenshot to the mom is questionable. It's a private matter and could lead to unintended consequences without proper context. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for how they're handling it, even if their intentions are to protect their girlfriend.\n"
