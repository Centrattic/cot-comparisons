All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend making a derogatory comment about their girlfriend's health issues, specifically her being swollen and bloated due to chemo. The author then sends a screenshot of this comment to the friend's mom, considering it a \"WIBTA\" (Would I Be Terrible For...).\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The friend made a joke about the author's girlfriend's weight and appearance, which is sensitive because the girlfriend is undergoing serious medical treatment. The author defends their girlfriend, but the friend responds dismissively. The author is considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom, possibly to escalate the issue behind the scenes.\n\nNow, the core question is whether the author is in the wrong. The friend's comments are clearly hurtful and inappropriate, especially given the girlfriend's medical condition. However, the author's response is to involve the friend's mother, which could be seen as a form of retaliation or a way to avoid direct confrontation. \n\nMoral considerations here include intent. The author's motive is to address the friend's insensitive remarks and protect their girlfriend. However, sending the screenshot without the friend's knowledge might be seen as a breach of trust or privacy, even if the original comments were offensive. \n\nLegal aspects might not be a factor here unless there's harassment, but the scenario doesn't mention that. The main issue is ethical. The author is trying to hold the friend accountable, but the method involves deception. Friends often have some level of trust, so using a screenshot to inform the friend's mom could be seen as crossing a boundary, even if the content was offensive.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's comments were cruel and showed no remorse. The author might feel that the friend isn't taking the issue seriously, so escalating to a parent could be a way to enforce accountability. However, the author could have addressed it directly first, perhaps with more confrontation. \n\nConsidering all this, the author is trying to correct a wrong done to their girlfriend, but the method (screenshot to mom) might be seen as underhanded. However, the friend's actions were clearly in the wrong. The balance here is tricky. But since the author is using a private message to a parent to address the issue rather than confronting the friend directly, there's a case for the author being wrong. Alternatively, if the friend's behavior is a pattern and the author feels no other options, it might not be wrong.\n\nBut generally, escalating behind the scenes without direct confrontation might not be the best approach. The author could be in the wrong for not addressing it upfront, but the initial comment was clearly offensive. Hmm. Maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong because the friend's comments were abhorrent and the author is trying to protect their girlfriend. However, the act of sending a screenshot without the friend's knowledge is a bit of a gray area. Still, given the context, the author's intentions are justified, so the answer might be B.\n"
