All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend making a really hurtful joke about his girlfriend who's going through chemo, and the author is considering sending a screenshot of that conversation to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The friend said something offensive about the author's girlfriend, who has a serious medical condition. The author tried to respond in a playful way initially but was met with a cruel remark. The friend then shows no remorse, and the author is considering exposing the message to his mom as a form of retaliation. The options are A (author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong).\n\nI should consider the moral and ethical implications. The friend's comment is clearly inappropriate and cruel, especially given the girlfriend's health situation. The author is upset and wants to address it. Sending the screenshot to the friend's mom is a form of confronting the issue but might be seen as involving parents unnecessarily. However, the alternative is to let it slide, which might not feel right if the friend is unapologetic.\n\nOn one hand, the author is standing up for their girlfriend, which is understandable. On the other, using a screenshot to the friend's mom could be seen as escalating the conflict in a way that's not constructive. The author is also aware that this isn't the most moral action but is conflicted about other options, like bringing up the friend's personal issues.\n\nI need to weigh intent versus action. The friend's comment was malicious, and the author is trying to hold them accountable. But the method of doing so by involving parents might not be the best approach. However, the friend's lack of remorse suggests they might not learn from a direct confrontation. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the friend clearly crossed a line. The author's reaction is a response to that, but the method might be questionable. However, given the context of the friend's behavior and the author's intent to protect their girlfriend, the action might be justified as a form of self-defense in a social context. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's action is a reaction to a harmful comment. While sending the screenshot to the mom isn't ideal, the underlying issue is the friend's cruel behavior. The author is trying to address a wrong by another person. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong because they're responding to an injustice, even if their method is debatable.\n"
