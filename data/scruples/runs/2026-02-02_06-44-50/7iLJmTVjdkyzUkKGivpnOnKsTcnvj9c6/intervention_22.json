All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of his friend making a derogatory comment about his girlfriend who's undergoing chemo to his friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend made a joke targeting the author's girlfriend's weight, which is a sensitive issue because her health condition (lupus, chemo, kidney issues) has led to her weight gain. The author initially thought it was a joke but then confronted the friend, who showed no remorse. The author is considering escalating by sending the screenshot to the friend's mom, which he knows is morally questionable but wants to avoid confrontation in front of others. \n\nNow, the key points here are: 1) The friend's comment was about a health-related issue that's very personal and sensitive. 2) The author is seeking a way to address this without direct confrontation, possibly due to fear of escalation or not wanting to cause a scene. 3) The proposed action is to involve the friend's parent, which could be seen as a form of social retaliation.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. On one hand, the friend's comment was clearly cruel and inconsiderate, targeting someone vulnerable. On the other hand, the author's response\u2014soliciting the friend's mother\u2014might be seen as a personal attack, especially since the author's friends are caught in the middle. The author's intention is to hold the friend accountable, but the method involves using a parent, which can be a sensitive issue. In some cultures, involving parents in such situations is a common way to address misbehavior, but in others, it might be seen as crossing a line, especially if done without context.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the friend has a history of hiding things from his parents, which might make the action more impactful. However, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The friend's comment was definitely unkind, but the author's response could be considered revenge without giving the friend a chance to explain or apologize. \n\nIt's a tricky situation. If the friend showed no remorse and the comment was truly insensitive, then maybe the author's actions are justified as a way to protect his girlfriend and stand up for her. However, escalating by informing the parent without trying to resolve it directly might be seen as underhanded. \n\nBut the friend's behavior is the initial wrong. The author's girlfriend is going through a tough time, and the comment was about her health condition. The friend's lack of empathy and refusal to apologize are problematic. The author's response, while unconventional, could be seen as a last resort to make the friend understand the severity of his words. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author should have confronted him directly or involved mutual friends first. But given that the author's friends are hesitant to take sides, sending the screenshot to the parent might be the only way to get through to him. \n\nIn terms of ethics, it's about proportionality. The friend's comment was a serious insult, targeting someone with a health issue. The author's response is a form of social consequence. However, sending a private message to the parent could be seen as a breach of privacy, even if it's for a good reason. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the friend's actions were clearly wrong, then the author's response might be justified. However, if the author's method is considered an overreaction or a personal vendetta, then he might be in the wrong. \n\nBut considering the context\u2014his girlfriend's health, the friend's lack of remorse, and the potential for the friend to learn from his mistake\u2014the author's actions might be understandable, even if not ideal. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the friend's comment was unacceptably cruel and the author is trying to address it in a way that holds the friend accountable, even if the method is unconventional. However, this is a close call. If the author had first tried to confront the friend directly and failed, then escalating might be more justified. Since the friend showed no remorse, the author's response could be a necessary step to correct the behavior, even if it's not the most mature approach.\n"
