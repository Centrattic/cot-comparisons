All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend making an offensive comment about his girlfriend who's going through chemo and has serious health issues. The author of the question believes the writer is in the wrong, but they want to confirm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario thoroughly. The friend in question said something extremely hurtful, referencing the girlfriend's weight and health condition. The writer, instead of confronting the friend directly or seeking appropriate help, considers sending a screenshot of the comment to the friend's mom. The writer is also part of a group chat where they hide things from the friend's parents, implying a pattern of covering up for him.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The friend's comment was clearly inappropriate and cruel, especially given the girlfriend's medical situation. The writer is upset and wants to retaliate. However, sending the screenshot to the friend's mom could be seen as an act of revenge rather than a constructive response. The writer might not have other avenues to address the issue, but using this method could be counterproductive. It might escalate tensions and potentially damage relationships, both with the friend and his family. \n\nAlso, the writer mentions that other friends are present and haven't taken sides yet. This suggests a possible group dynamic where peer pressure or fear of confrontation is a factor. The writer's decision to go behind the friend's back and involve his mom might be a way to feel empowered, but it's not a mature or communicative approach. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend's initial comment was unacceptable, and the writer is justified in being angry. However, the method of response is questionable. The right approach would be to address the issue directly with the friend, set boundaries, or involve a trusted adult if necessary. Sending the screenshot to the friend's mom could be seen as crossing a line, even if the friend's comment was wrong. \n\nThe writer might argue that the friend's actions were so hurtful that drastic measures are needed. But the act of sending the screenshot is a breach of trust and privacy, which can have its own consequences. It's a form of retaliation that doesn't resolve the underlying issue and could lead to further conflict.\n\nIn terms of morality, the friend's comment was definitely in the wrong, but the writer's response is also problematic. The key is whether the writer's action was justified. While the friend's behavior is inexcusable, the writer's method of confronting the issue is not. Therefore, the writer is in the wrong for choosing an inappropriate and potentially harmful response.\n"
