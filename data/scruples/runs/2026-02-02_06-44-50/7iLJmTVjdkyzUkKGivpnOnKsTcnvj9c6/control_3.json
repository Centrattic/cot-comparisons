All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend making a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend who's undergoing chemo and has serious health issues. The author considers sending a screenshot of the offensive message to the friend's mom. \n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The friend made a hurtful comment targeting the girlfriend's health condition, which is a serious matter. The author's initial response was to joke back about the friend's weight, which might not have been the best approach, but the friend escalated with a derogatory remark. The author then confronts the friend, but the friend shows no remorse.\n\nNow, the main question is about the author's potential wrongdoing in considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom. Retaliation can be problematic, but the context here is important. The friend's comment was not just a personal attack but targeted a vulnerable health condition. The author's action might be seen as a way to hold the friend accountable, especially since the friend dismissed the issue and showed no empathy.\n\nHowever, sending the screenshot could be seen as a breach of privacy or an escalation. The author's intention here is to address a serious insult, but the method might not be appropriate. But considering the friend's lack of remorse and the severity of the insult, some might argue that the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, even if the friend's comment was wrong, the author's response of sharing it with the friend's mom could be viewed as a form of revenge. But given the context of the friend's cruel joke and the lack of apology, others might see it as a justified action to highlight the friend's inappropriate behavior to an authority figure. \n\nThe key factors here are the severity of the initial insult, the friend's response, and the author's intent. The author might not be in the wrong because the friend's actions were inexcusable. However, the method of confrontation could be debated. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, considering the context, the answer might lean towards B (No). The author is reacting to a serious and hurtful comment, and while the method might be questionable, the intent is to address a valid concern.\n"
