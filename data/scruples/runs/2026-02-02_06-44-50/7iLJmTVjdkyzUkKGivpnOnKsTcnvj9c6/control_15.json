All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend making a hurtful comment about the author's girlfriend who's going through chemo, and the author considering sending a screenshot of that comment to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The friend made a joke about the author's girlfriend, who is dealing with serious health issues. The author is upset and considering taking action by sharing the screenshot with the friend's mother. The options are whether the author is wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nI should consider the context. The friend's comment was about the girlfriend's weight, which is related to her medical condition. Making fun of someone's health, especially when they're already suffering, is generally considered insensitive. The friend showed no remorse and even dismissed the author's concern. \n\nThe author is conflicted. They want to address the friend's behavior but are considering a private action that involves the friend's family. Sending the screenshot to the mom might escalate the situation and involve parents, which the group usually avoids. However, the author feels that the friend is in the wrong and wants to make him aware of the impact of his words.\n\nI need to evaluate the ethics here. The friend's actions were definitely inappropriate. However, the author's response\u2014sending the screenshot to the mom\u2014could be seen as a form of retaliation. But given the context of the friend's lack of empathy and the seriousness of the comment, the author might feel justified in trying to correct the friend through this method. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author should handle it directly without involving the parents, especially since there's a history of keeping things from them. But the author is also in a group where others are not taking sides, so they might feel isolated. The action could be a way to enforce accountability.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the friend's behavior was clearly wrong, but the author's action is a response. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on perspective. If the action is seen as a necessary step to address the friend's harmful behavior, then maybe not. But if it's seen as an overstep, then yes. However, given the friend's lack of remorse and the sensitive nature of the joke, the author's action might be justified as a way to highlight the inappropriateness of the comment. So the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
