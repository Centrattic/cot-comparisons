All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend making a hurtful comment about the author's girlfriend, who is going through chemo and has health issues. The author is considering sending a screenshot of the friend's message to his mom.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The friend made a cruel joke targeting the girlfriend's weight, which is a result of her medical condition. The author confronts the friend, but the friend shows no remorse. The author feels justified in wanting to escalate the situation by involving the friend's mom, possibly to teach him a lesson or hold him accountable.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The friend's comment was clearly inappropriate and hurtful, especially given the context of the girlfriend's health. The author is defending his girlfriend, which is understandable. However, sending the screenshot to the friend's mom could be seen as a form of revenge or retaliation. While the friend's actions were in the wrong, the author's response might not be the best approach. It could damage the friendship and potentially cause conflict with the friend's family. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the friend's behavior was unacceptable. On the other hand, the author's method of addressing it could be seen as crossing a line, especially if it's done without considering the consequences or if it's part of a pattern of hiding things from parents. The author's friends are also caught in the middle, not taking sides yet. \n\nI need to weigh the intentions. The author's intention is to stand up for his girlfriend and address the friend's harmful comment. However, using the group chat's trust to send a screenshot to the mom might be a breach of privacy or an escalation that could have unintended consequences. The friend's lack of remorse is a problem, but the author's action might be seen as an overreaction if done without a clear resolution or if it's meant to humiliate the friend.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the friend is clearly in the wrong with his initial comment. The author is responding to that, but the method of response is questionable. Sending a screenshot to a parent might not be the best way to handle it. It's possible that the author is justified in wanting to address the issue, but the approach could be problematic. So, the answer might be B (No) because the author is not in the wrong for wanting to protect his girlfriend, but the action itself might be debatable. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and considering the context, maybe the answer is B.\n"
