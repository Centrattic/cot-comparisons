All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to his mom. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend, who's going through chemo and has health issues. The author responded by sending the screenshot to the friend's mom, possibly to get the friend in trouble. The group chat friends didn't really support the author, and the friend showed no remorse.\n\nNow, considering the context, the friend's comment was not just a joke but targeted someone with serious health problems. That's pretty insensitive. The author's reaction is driven by anger and a desire to hold the friend accountable, especially since the friend dismissed the situation.\n\nBut, sending the screenshot to the mom could be seen as revenge or escalation. However, given the severity of the friend's comment and the lack of remorse, maybe the author felt it was justified. The friends didn't step in, so the author took matters into their own hands.\n\nThe question is about morality and whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, confronting the friend directly or involving others might be better. On the other hand, the friend's actions were hurtful and the author felt unheard. \n\nI think the key points are the cruelty of the friend's remark and the author's intent to prevent future harm. If the author's action leads to the friend facing consequences, maybe it's a necessary step. However, bypassing privacy and escalating via parents could have negative repercussions. But given the context, the author's actions might be seen as a response to being dismissed by peers and the friend's callousness.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because the friend's comment was malicious and the author had valid reasons to act, given the lack of support from others.\n"
