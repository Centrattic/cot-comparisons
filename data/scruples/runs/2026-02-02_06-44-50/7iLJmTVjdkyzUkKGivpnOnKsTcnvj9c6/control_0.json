All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the WIBTA question is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend making a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend who's undergoing chemo. The author is considering sending a screenshot of the joke to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend made a really hurtful comment targeting the author's girlfriend's health issues. The author's girlfriend is going through a serious medical condition, which the joke directly mocks. The friend didn't apologize and showed no remorse. The author is frustrated and wants to retaliate by showing the mom the screenshot. They mention that others in the group chat haven't taken sides yet.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The friend's comment was clearly inappropriate and insensitive. The author's reaction is to involve the friend's mom. Is this justified?\n\nOn one hand, the friend's comment was cruel and targeted someone vulnerable. The author is upset and wants to address it. On the other hand, sending a screenshot to the mom is a form of retaliation and might escalate the situation. It's important to consider privacy and whether the author has the right to share that message without the friend's consent.\n\nBut the key point here is the context of the friend's comment. He made a joke about the author's girlfriend's health, which is a serious and sensitive issue. The friend showed no remorse, which adds to the author's frustration. The author is trying to protect their girlfriend's feelings and hold the friend accountable.\n\nHowever, sending the screenshot to the friend's mom could be seen as a breach of privacy. Even if the original comment was wrong, the author's action bypasses the friend and goes straight to the parent, which might not be the best approach. It could also involve the parent in a conflict that started between peers. But given the severity of the comment, maybe it's a justified action to prevent further harm.\n\nBut is the author the one in the wrong? If the friend's comment was unprovoked and cruel, the author's response might be a way to address it. However, the method of addressing it (sending to the mom) could be problematic. It's a tough call. Legally, sharing someone's messages without their consent is an invasion of privacy. Ethically, it's about protecting a loved one from mockery versus respecting someone else's privacy.\n\nIn these types of situations, usually, the person being targeted is in the right. The friend made a harmful comment, the author tried to address it and was ignored. The author's desire to take action is understandable. However, the method of action could be questioned. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes) or B (no).\n\nConsidering that the friend's initial comment was the problem, the author is responding to a harmful action. The author's action is a form of retaliation but in defense of their girlfriend. However, the author is using a private message and sharing it without consent. The author's action might be wrong in terms of privacy, but the friend's action was worse. So, is the author in the wrong? Maybe not entirely. The original wrongdoer is the friend. The author's action is a response, but it's still a breach of privacy. But maybe in this context, it's a justifiable action given the severity of the offense.\n\nHmm. The answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the friend's comment was inexcusable, and the author is trying to protect their girlfriend. However, the action of sending the screenshot to the mom could be seen as crossing a line. But given the circumstances, it's a close call. I think the key is that the author is responding to a harmful action without any resolution. The friend's comment was unprovoked and cruel. The author's action is a way to address it when direct confrontation failed. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
