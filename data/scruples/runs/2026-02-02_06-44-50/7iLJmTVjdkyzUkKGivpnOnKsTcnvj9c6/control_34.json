All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who is considering sending a screenshot of their friend making a hurtful comment about their girlfriend to his mom is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend making a joke about the girlfriend's condition, which is chemo-related and serious.\n\nFirst, the friend made a comment that was clearly inappropriate, especially given the girlfriend's health issues. The author confronted him, but the friend dismissed it with \"Don't talk shit then.\" The author is considering escalating the situation by sending the screenshot to the friend's mom, possibly to get the friend in trouble with his parents.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's break it down. The friend's comment was hurtful and insensitive. The author tried to address it but the friend didn't take it seriously. The author is now considering a private action against the friend, which might be seen as a form of retaliation. However, the context is that the friend has a history of making inappropriate comments, and the author's girlfriend is in a vulnerable health state.\n\nOn one hand, escalating the situation by involving the friend's mom could be seen as a private retaliation, not through proper channels but through social pressure. On the other hand, if the author had first talked to the friend's parents directly to address the behavior, that might be a more appropriate approach. However, the author might feel that the friend is beyond reasoning and that the only way to make him understand the severity is to involve his parents. \n\nBut sending a screenshot without context might not give the friend an opportunity to explain or apologize. Also, it could strain the author's own relationships with other friends who might be involved. However, given the friend's lack of remorse and the sensitive health condition of the girlfriend, the author might feel justified in taking this step to protect their partner's feelings and hold the friend accountable.\n\nIn terms of morality, it's a gray area. The friend's behavior was clearly wrong, but the author's method of addressing it might be seen as underhanded. However, considering the context of the friend's ongoing insensitivity and the author's frustration, some might argue that the author is trying to correct a wrong done to their significant other. \n\nThe key points are: the friend's comment was cruel, the author tried to address it but the friend didn't care, and the author is considering a private retaliation. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If we consider that the author is trying to stand up for their partner against a friend who is being harmful, then maybe they are not in the wrong. However, the method (screenshot to mom) skips direct confrontation and involves a third party in a potentially negative way, which could be seen as wrong.\n\nBut given the friend's history and the author's frustration, the action might be seen as a necessary step to make the friend understand the impact of his words, especially since the author's other friends aren't taking sides. So the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the author is defending their partner from a hurtful comment.\n"
