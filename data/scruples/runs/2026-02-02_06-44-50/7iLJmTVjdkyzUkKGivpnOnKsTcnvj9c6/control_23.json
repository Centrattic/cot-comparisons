All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive comment about their girlfriend who's going through chemo to his mom. \n\nFirst, the friend made a really hurtful joke targeting the girlfriend's health and appearance, which is serious because she's dealing with a life-threatening illness. The friend showed no remorse and even doubled down with a comment about her weight and his own insecurities. \n\nNow, the author is considering sending the screenshot. The question is whether that's wrong. If we look at the context, the friend's behavior was clearly inappropriate and inconsiderate. The author tried to confront him, but the friend dismissed it. The author's friends are hesitant to take sides, so they're using this as a way to hold the friend accountable without escalating in front of others.\n\nThe moral dilemma here is about privacy and the right to report someone's harmful behavior. Normally, sending someone's private messages to their parent without consent could be seen as a breach of privacy. But in this case, the comment was extremely cruel and targeted a vulnerable person. The author is using this as a last resort because the friend isn't taking responsibility. \n\nSo, considering the friend's lack of remorse and the severity of the comment, the author's action might be justified as a protective measure for their girlfriend and to address the friend's toxic behavior. The key point is that the comment was not just a joke but a harmful attack on someone's health and appearance, which is a serious issue. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here because they're responding to a clear case of cruelty.\n"
