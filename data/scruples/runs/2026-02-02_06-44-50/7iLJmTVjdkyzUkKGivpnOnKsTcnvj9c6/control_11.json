All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me go through the situation step by step.\n\nThe author's friend made a joke in a group chat about the author's girlfriend, who's going through chemo. The friend first said, \"Why do you sound like such a bitch?\" and then when the author responded, the friend made a comment about his girlfriend being fat. The girlfriend is actually swollen and bloated due to medical issues, having gone from 108 to 170 pounds because of her health problems. The author then tells the friend he went too far, but the friend doesn't show remorse. The author is considering sending a screenshot of this conversation to the friend's mom to escalate things.\n\nFirst, let's assess the friend's actions. The friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend's health condition. That's pretty bad, especially since the girlfriend is suffering. The friend's comment could be considered hurtful and inconsiderate, maybe even offensive. The author was defending their girlfriend's dignity, which seems reasonable.\n\nNow, the author's response is to consider sending the screenshot to the friend's mom. The author is worried about escalating the situation but feels they can't confront the friend directly without revealing other sensitive info (like the friend's real dad leaving him). The question is whether the author is in the wrong for planning this.\n\nOn one hand, the friend's behavior was inappropriate, and the author is trying to address it. On the other hand, sending a screenshot to a parent without consent could be seen as a violation of privacy. But the author's motivation is to hold the friend accountable for a hurtful comment, which might be justified. However, using a parent could be seen as a form of manipulation or escalation, which might not be the best approach. \n\nBut the core issue is whether the author is in the wrong. The friend made a harmful joke about a vulnerable person. The author is trying to respond, and while sending the screenshot might not be the most constructive approach, it's a reaction to a serious offense. The author isn't attacking the friend for no reason; they're addressing a specific, harmful comment. \n\nSo, the author's action is a response to the friend's wrongdoings. While the method might be questionable, the initial wrong lies with the friend. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer would be B (No)."
