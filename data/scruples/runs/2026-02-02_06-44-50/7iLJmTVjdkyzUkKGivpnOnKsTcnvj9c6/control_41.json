All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is 18 and in a group chat with friends. A friend makes a comment that's really offensive towards his girlfriend, who's going through chemo and has health issues. The friend's joke is about her being fat because of her medical condition. The author is considering sending a screenshot of that comment to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, the friend's comment is clearly inappropriate. Making fun of someone's medical condition, especially when it's related to chemo and severe health issues, is crossing a line. The author is upset because the friend shows no remorse and even deflects by saying \"Don't talk shit then.\" The author feels justified in their anger because the comment was not just rude but targeted someone's vulnerability.\n\nNow, the author is thinking of escalating the situation by sending the screenshot to the friend's mom. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nOn one hand, sending a screenshot to the parent could be seen as a form of retaliation. It's bypassing the friend and involving the parent directly, which might not be the usual way to handle conflicts. However, considering the context\u2014mocking a girlfriend's health issues and the friend's lack of remorse\u2014it's a serious issue. The author isn't trying to attack the friend's dad but to address the offensive comment. The friends in the group chat aren't taking a side, so the author feels isolated.\n\nThe moral dilemma here is whether the ends justify the means. The friend's behavior is harmful and shows a lack of empathy. The author is trying to hold the friend accountable, albeit in a confrontational way. While it's not the most ideal approach (like confronting the friend directly or getting a mediator), the situation's severity might justify the action. The key points are the nature of the comment and the friend's response. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, if we look at intent, the author's goal is to stop the friend from making such comments again. The method is questionable, but the intent is to protect their girlfriend and address a serious issue. However, escalating by involving the parent could be seen as overstepping, especially if the author didn't try other methods first. But given the context of the friend's behavior and the group's inaction, the author's decision might be seen as a last resort. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the friend's actions were inexcusably offensive, and the author is reacting to defend their girlfriend's dignity. However, some might argue that the author should handle it more privately. But given the severity of the comment, the lack of remorse, and the potential for ongoing harm, the author's actions could be seen as justified despite the method.\n"
