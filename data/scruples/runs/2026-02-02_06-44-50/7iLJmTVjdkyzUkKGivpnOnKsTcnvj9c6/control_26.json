All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong.\n\nSo the situation is: the author's friend made a comment in a group chat that mocked the author's girlfriend, who's going through chemo and has serious health issues. The friend said something about her weight, referencing her being \"400 pounds\" and the author's girlfriend being swollen from her medical condition. The author responded by telling the friend to stop, but the friend was dismissive. Now the author is considering sending a screenshot of the friend's comment to his mom, and the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the severity of the friend's actions. The friend made a cruel joke about someone who's very ill. The girlfriend's health is a serious matter, so the comment was not just a joke but hurtful and insensitive. The friend shows no remorse, which is a problem.\n\nThe author is considering taking action by involving the friend's mom. In some cases, involving parents might be seen as crossing a line, but given the context, the friend's behavior was targeted at someone vulnerable. The author's girlfriend is in a fragile state, so the friend's comments are especially harmful.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong for wanting to show the friend's mom the screenshot? Well, the friend's actions were clearly inappropriate. The author tried to address it directly but didn't get a satisfactory response. The author is trying to hold the friend accountable, especially since the friend's comments were not just a minor joke but targeted someone with a serious illness.\n\nHowever, there's a consideration of privacy and the method used. Sending a screenshot to the friend's mom could be seen as a breach of privacy, but given the context of the friend's abusive comment, the author might feel it's justified. The group chat wasn't a private conversation between the author and the friend, so the author might have a point in wanting to involve the friend's parents, especially if there's a pattern of behavior.\n\nAlso, the friend's response, \"Don't talk shit then,\" suggests he's not taking responsibility. The author's action is a way to escalate the issue, possibly to make the friend face consequences. Since the friend's parents are involved in other aspects (like hiding things from them), the author might feel that this is a necessary step.\n\nIn terms of morality, the author is trying to protect their girlfriend and hold a friend accountable for harmful behavior. While the method might be questionable, the intent is to address a serious issue. So the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (B), because the friend's actions were harmful and the author is reacting to protect their loved one.\n"
