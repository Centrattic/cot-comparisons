All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the original scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend making a cruel comment about their girlfriend who's going through chemo and has health issues.\n\nFirst, the friend said something offensive in a group chat. The author responded by making a joke about the friend's physique, which led to the friend making a comment about the author's girlfriend's weight, referencing her health issues. The author then confronts the friend, but the friend doesn't apologize and even says, \"Don't talk shit then.\" Now, the author is considering sending a screenshot of this exchange to the friend's mom, hence the question if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here: the friend made a hurtful comment about the author's girlfriend's medical condition, which is serious. The author is considering taking a screenshot and sending it to the friend's mom as a form of retaliation. The author is trying to avoid escalating the situation in front of other friends but feels wronged because the friend shows no remorse.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering this action. On one hand, the friend's comment was definitely inappropriate and cruel, targeting someone with a serious illness. The author is trying to stand up for their girlfriend and hold the friend accountable. On the other hand, sending a screenshot to the friend's mom could be seen as sharing private messages without consent, which might be a violation of privacy. However, the context is that the friend's comment was malicious and the author feels that other friends aren't taking sides, so they're trying to involve the friend's parent as a next step.\n\nBut here's the thing: the friend's comment was offensive and hurtful, so there's a valid reason for the author to be upset. The author is trying to address the issue, albeit through a method that might not be the most appropriate. However, considering the friend's lack of remorse and the severity of the comment, the author's action could be seen as a justified attempt to bring attention to the friend's behavior, especially if the parent can intervene.\n\nBut sending private messages to a parent could be seen as a breach of trust, even if the content is offensive. The group chat was private, and sharing that without consent is a violation. However, some might argue that in cases of bullying or harmful behavior, it's acceptable to involve a parent. It's a bit of a gray area. The author's main goal is to stop the friend from making those comments again, which is understandable. The method they're using is questionable, but the intent is to protect their girlfriend and hold the friend accountable.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong because the friend's actions were inexcusable. However, the action of sharing the screenshot is a form of retaliation that might not be the best approach. The author could have addressed it directly with the friend or involved other friends first. But given the friend's lack of remorse and the severity of the comment, the author's reaction is driven by a desire to protect their girlfriend's well-being. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because the friend's comment was harmful and the author is trying to address it, even if their method is questionable. However, there's a nuance here. The author's action might not be the best approach, but it's a response to someone who clearly crossed a line. So, the answer is B.\n"
