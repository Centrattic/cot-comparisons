All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The author's friend made a cruel joke about his girlfriend who's undergoing chemo and has health issues. The author is considering sending a screenshot of that joke to the friend's mom. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for planning to do that.\n\nSo, the friend's comment was clearly hurtful and inconsiderate. The girlfriend's health is a serious matter, and making a joke about her weight and appearance during such a vulnerable time is really insensitive. The author confronts the friend, but the friend dismisses it and shows no remorse. \n\nNow, the author's response is to consider sending the screenshot to the friend's mom. The possible wrong here is that the author is retaliating by exposing the friend's comment to his parents. The friend's mom might not know the context, so the author could be framing it in a way that's misleading or harsh. Also, the author mentions that they and their friends often hide things from the friend's parents, implying a pattern of secrecy.\n\nIs the author justified? Well, the friend's comment was wrong, but the author's response is to take matters into their own hands by involving the parents without giving the friend a fair chance to explain or apologize. However, considering the friend's lack of remorse and the serious nature of the joke, some might argue that the author is defending their girlfriend's dignity.\n\nOn the other hand, publicly shaming someone by sending a screenshot to their parents could be seen as a disproportionate response. It's possible that the author isn't giving the friend a chance to make amends, and it might escalate the conflict unnecessarily. Also, the author is using their friends' secrets to their advantage, which could create more issues down the line.\n\nSo, the key points are: the friend's comment was cruel, the author's response is to retaliate by exposing it to parents, which might be harsh. The author's friends are unsure, and there's a history of hiding things from the friend's parents.\n\nIn terms of morality, while the friend is clearly at fault for the comment, the author's action might not be the most constructive. However, the line between standing up for someone and taking revenge can be blurry here. The author's intention is to hold the friend accountable, but the method is questionable.\n\nI think the author is in the wrong because escalating the situation by sending the screenshot to the friend's mom without context could be harmful. It's a form of shaming and might not lead to a resolution. The author should perhaps involve a teacher, counselor, or find another way to address the issue rather than using a personal vendetta approach. But there's also the argument that the friend's behavior is unacceptable and the author is trying to protect their girlfriend's feelings.\n\nHmm. The answer hinges on whether the action is justified as a response to a serious insult. If the friend had no remorse, maybe the author is trying to make him face consequences. But the method is questionable. The question is about the author's wrongness. Since the friend's comment was worse, the author's action, while not ideal, might be seen as a reaction in self-defense. However, the act of sending it to the mom without context could be considered wrong, hence the author is in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
