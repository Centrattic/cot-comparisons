All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to his mom.\n\nFirst, the friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend who's undergoing chemo. The author confronted him, but the friend showed no remorse. The author is considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom to get her involved. \n\nNow, the key points: The friend's comment was hurtful and targeted someone with a serious illness. The author tried to address it directly, but the friend didn't apologize. The author is frustrated and wants to escalate to his mom. \n\nEthically, is sending the screenshot justified? On one hand, the friend's comment was inappropriate. On the other, the author is using a private message and involving the parent without the friend's knowledge. This could be seen as a breach of privacy, even if the intent is to hold the friend accountable. \n\nBut considering the context of the friend's lack of remorse and the serious nature of the joke, the author's actions might be driven by a desire to make the friend understand the severity of their words. However, the method of using a screenshot to the mom could be seen as an overreach. The author might be trying to publicly shame the friend or involve a parent without giving the friend a chance to make amends. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The friend's initial comment was definitely wrong, but the author's response might be crossing a line into retaliation rather than a constructive resolution. Sending the screenshot could damage the friendship and relationships further without resolving the issue. So, while the friend's actions were worse, the author's decision to involve the parent without the friend's consent might place them in the wrong as well.\n"
