All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation involves a friend making a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend who's undergoing chemo. The author is considering sending a screenshot of the joke to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, the friend's comment is clearly in poor taste. The girlfriend has a serious medical condition, and the joke is insensitive. The author was upset and tried to address it but the friend didn't apologize. Now the author is conflicted about escalating by sending the screenshot to the mom.\n\nOn one hand, the friend's behavior was hurtful and inconsiderate. The author has every right to be angry and want to protect their girlfriend's feelings. On the other hand, escalating the situation by involving the friend's mom might be seen as a harsh response, especially if the author hasn't tried other avenues first, like a more direct confrontation or seeking mediation from mutual friends.\n\nThe key points are: the friend's comment was cruel and targeted the girlfriend's health issues, the author tried to address it but the friend dismissed it, and the author is considering a response that involves the friend's parents. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for this action.\n\nThe author's intention is to hold the friend accountable, but using a screenshot to the friend's mom could be seen as a breach of trust or privacy if the group chat was meant to be among friends. However, given the severity of the comment, some might argue it's justified to involve a parent to correct the behavior. Others might say the author should handle it directly without involving others.\n\nSince the friend showed no remorse and the comment was particularly hurtful, the author's actions could be seen as a proportionate response to protect their girlfriend and address the friend's lack of empathy. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). However, if the author bypassed all other steps and immediately went to the parent, that could be seen as escalation without proper process, possibly making them in the wrong. But considering the context, the author's actions might be justified.\n"
