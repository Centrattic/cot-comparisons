All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive comments to his mom. \n\nFirst, the context: the friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend, who is going through chemo and has serious health issues. The friend not only insulted the author but also their girlfriend in a very sensitive situation. The author tried to confront the friend, but the friend dismissed it and showed no remorse.\n\nNow, the author's action was to take a screenshot of that conversation and send it to the friend's mom. The question is whether this is wrong. \n\nOn one hand, the friend's behavior was clearly inappropriate and hurtful. The author was trying to address it, but when confrontation didn't work, they took a more drastic step. Sending the screenshot to the friend's mom could be seen as a form of seeking accountability, especially since the friend showed no remorse and the author felt that other friends were not supporting them. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is bypassing the friend and involving his mother, which might be considered a betrayal of trust or an invasion of privacy. However, considering the severity of the comments and the friend's lack of empathy, some might argue that the author had a right to act to protect their partner and hold the friend accountable.\n\nThe key factors here are the intent behind the action and the context. The author's intent was to address hurtful behavior that their partner is going through a tough time, and the friend's refusal to acknowledge wrongdoing. The method of confrontation might be questionable, but the underlying issue is the friend's harmful behavior. \n\nIn such cases, people often debate between privacy and accountability. While sending messages to a parent isn't the usual approach, the circumstances are extreme. The author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to prevent further harm, especially given the friend's dismissive attitude. However, there's a valid argument about the appropriateness of the method. \n\nBut considering the severity of the friend's comments and the lack of remorse, the author's action could be seen as a justified attempt to address the issue when other methods failed. So, the answer leans towards B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
