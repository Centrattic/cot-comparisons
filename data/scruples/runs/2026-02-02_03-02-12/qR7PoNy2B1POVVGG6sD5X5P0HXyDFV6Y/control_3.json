It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting their husband during an argument. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: they had a political argument, which escalated into yelling and mocking. The wife then hit her husband with a closed fist, causing a bruise. The husband ran off, came back later, called her a name, and left again. The author is questioning if she's the asshole for punching him or if he's overreacting.\n\nLooking at the details, physical violence in a relationship is generally not acceptable, regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was being abusive or yelling, hitting him is a form of abuse and crosses a line. The author admits they usually avoid political discussions, which suggests they knew there was a risk of conflict but chose to engage. The husband's response of yelling and mocking is bad, but it doesn't justify the wife hitting him. \n\nThe edits show that the author later realizes their mistake and plans to apologize, which is a positive step. However, the initial action of using physical violence is still wrong. The fact that it was the first time doesn't excuse it. In relationships, using physical force to resolve arguments is a serious issue and can lead to cycles of abuse. It's important to address conflicts without violence. The husband's reaction, while also poor, doesn't justify the wife's actions. So, the answer here is that the author is in the wrong.\n"
