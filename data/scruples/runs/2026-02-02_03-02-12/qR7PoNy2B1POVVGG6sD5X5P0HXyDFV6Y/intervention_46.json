It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation involves a political disagreement, with the husband yelling and mocking her, leading her to punch him. There are also edits where she acknowledges it was wrong and plans to apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The argument started over politics, which they usually avoid discussing. The husband escalated things by yelling and mocking her. She hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. He then left, and she's now questioning if she's the asshole.\n\nPhysical violence is generally not acceptable in relationships, regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was being aggressive, hitting him is a form of physical assault. The fact that it was a closed fist to the face could be seen as a significant act of violence, even if it didn't result in serious injury. The woman's initial response is to question if he's overreacting, which might indicate she doesn't fully recognize the severity of her actions. However, in her edit, she admits she was wrong and plans to apologize, showing some self-awareness.\n\nThe husband's behavior (yelling and mocking) is also problematic, but that doesn't justify her hitting him. Both parties contributed to the escalation, but the use of physical violence crosses a line. The author's justification might be that she was in a fit of rage, but that doesn't excuse the action. In most ethical and legal standards, hitting someone, even in anger, is wrong. So, the answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong). However, there's nuance because the husband's behavior was also inappropriate. But the question is specifically about the author's actions. So yes, she is in the wrong.\n"
