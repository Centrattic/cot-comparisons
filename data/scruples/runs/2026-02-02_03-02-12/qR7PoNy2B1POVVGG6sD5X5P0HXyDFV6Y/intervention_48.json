It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The woman and her husband had a political argument. He's Republican, she's Democrat, and they usually avoid discussing their differences. This time, it escalated into a yelling argument, with him mocking her. In a fit of rage, she hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. He left, calling her a \"bitch,\" and she hasn't seen him since. She's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nNow, considering the facts. Hitting someone, even in anger, is generally considered violent and wrong. Physical violence in a relationship is a serious issue, regardless of the context. Even if there was provocation, using physical force is not acceptable. The woman acknowledges her mistake in an edit, saying she'll apologize and that it was a first-time incident. But the initial action of hitting him is a problem.\n\nThe husband's behavior\u2014yelling and mocking\u2014might have contributed, but that doesn't justify the punch. In many cases, people might argue about whether the response was disproportionate, but physical violence crosses a line. There's also the part where he called her a \"bitch\" after she hit him, which could be his way of escalating things, but that doesn't make her hitting him right.\n\nAlso, her edit about a troll account and the last edit with a racist slur might be distractions or attempts to deflect, but the main issue is the punch. She later admits she was wrong, but the question is about whether she was in the wrong at the time.\n\nIn terms of societal norms and legal standards, even if it's mutual escalation, the act of hitting someone is typically seen as wrong. So the answer would be A, yes, she's in the wrong.\n"
