It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. Let's see.\n\nSo the situation: they had a political argument about abortion, with differing views. The husband started yelling and mocking her, leading to her hitting him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. Then he left, and she hasn't seen him since. She's asking if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws regarding domestic violence. In most places, even if someone provokes a situation, using physical force against another person is illegal. Hitting someone, even in a heated argument, is considered assault. So legally, she might be in the wrong because she caused injury, regardless of the provocation.\n\nEmotionally, the situation is complex. The husband was yelling and mocking, which is disrespectful. But that doesn't make it okay for her to hit him. Both sides should avoid physical violence. However, the key point here is that she initiated physical contact, which escalated the situation.\n\nAlso, the edits show that she later realizes she was wrong and plans to apologize. That shows some self-awareness, but it doesn't undo the action. The act of hitting someone is a clear violation, even if done in the heat of the moment.\n\nThere's also the edit about a troll account pretending to be her husband. That complicates things a bit, but the original question is about her actions. The troll might be trying to stir up more drama, but the original action is hers.\n\nIn terms of social norms, using physical violence in a relationship is generally frowned upon. It's often considered a serious issue, regardless of the reason. Even if both were at fault in the argument, the physical act is a clear wrongdoing.\n\nSo putting it all together, even though the husband was yelling, the act of hitting him makes her the one in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
