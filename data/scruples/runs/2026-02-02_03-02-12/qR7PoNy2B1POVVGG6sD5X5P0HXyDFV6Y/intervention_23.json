It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting her husband. The situation is a political argument between a Republican husband and a Democrat wife about abortion. They usually ignore their differences, but this time it escalated. The husband started yelling and mocking her, and she hit him in a fit of rage. She later apologized, and it's her first time doing something like that. There's also an edit where she says she realizes it was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether physical violence in a relationship is justifiable under any circumstances. Generally, using physical force to resolve an argument is considered wrong, even in heated situations. Mutual respect and non-violent communication are key in relationships. Even if the husband was yelling and mocking her, hitting him crosses a line. The fact that she later apologized and realized her mistake shows she understands this, but the action itself is problematic.\n\nThen there's the husband's response. He called her a \"bitch\" and left, which is disrespectful and hurtful. However, his behavior doesn't justify her hitting him. Both parties need to take responsibility for their actions. The key point here is that violence is never an acceptable response, regardless of provocation. Even if he was being an asshole, the physical hit is what's causing the bigger issue here.\n\nAlso, the edit about the troll account and the \"GAMERS RISE UP\" edit seems like a red herring or maybe the user is trying to add some humor or distraction. But the core issue remains the physical violence. The user might be seeking validation that her actions were justified given the provocation, but in reality, it's not.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because hitting someone, even in anger, is not acceptable. The husband's behavior was bad too, but that doesn't excuse the physical violence. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
