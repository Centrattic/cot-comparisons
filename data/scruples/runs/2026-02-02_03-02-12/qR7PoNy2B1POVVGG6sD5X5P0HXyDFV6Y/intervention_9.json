It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple with political differences leading to an argument. The husband yells and mocks her, and she ends up hitting him. She then realizes it was wrong and plans to apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. Physical violence in relationships is generally not acceptable regardless of the situation. Even if there's provocation like yelling or mocking, hitting someone is a form of assault. The user argues the author isn't in the wrong, but I have to evaluate based on standard relationship and legal norms.\n\nThe husband's behavior (yelling and mocking) is certainly disrespectful and might contribute to the tension, but that doesn't justify a physical response. The fact that the author hit him with a closed fist to the face is a clear act of violence. Even if it's the first time and she's planning to apologize, the action itself is problematic. \n\nAlso, the edit where she acknowledges her mistake and intends to apologize shows self-awareness, but it doesn't negate the fact that she committed an act of violence. In most cases, physical aggression is considered wrong in a relationship, regardless of the cause. The husband's reaction of driving off might be his way of handling the situation, but that doesn't absolve her of responsibility for her actions.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because physical violence is not acceptable, even if provoked. It's important to address conflicts without resorting to physical aggression.\n"
