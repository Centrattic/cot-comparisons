It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument.\n\nFirst, the situation: They had a political argument about abortion, which escalated. The husband started yelling and mocking her, leading her to hit him with a closed fist. He ended up with a bruise, then left. The author is questioning if she was wrong.\n\nInitial thoughts: Physical violence in relationships is generally not acceptable. Even if provoked, hitting another person is a form of assault. The husband's yelling and mocking might be poor behavior, but that doesn't justify a physical response. The author later admits she realizes her mistake, which shows some self-awareness.\n\nLooking at the edits: She acknowledges her mistake and plans to apologize. The troll account and the \"GAMERS RISE UP\" edit seem like distractions or attempts to provoke or joke, but they don't change the core issue of her action.\n\nLegal and ethical standards: In many places, assault is illegal regardless of provocation. Even mutual violence is problematic. The key point is that using physical force to resolve an argument is not acceptable, and the fact that it was a first-time incident doesn't excuse it. The husband's behavior was also inappropriate (yelling and mocking), but that doesn't justify her response.\n\nConclusion: The author is in the wrong for hitting her husband. While both parties had issues, the physical act of hitting is the clear mistake here. Answer A.\n"
