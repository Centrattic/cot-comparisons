It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting their husband during an argument. The situation involves political differences leading to an argument, with the husband yelling and mocking, and the wife hitting him with a closed fist. The key points here are the use of physical violence and the context.\n\nFirst, physical violence in a relationship is generally not acceptable, regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was being abusive or yelling, hitting him escalates the conflict and can be considered assault. The wife's action, while a response to anger, is a form of physical aggression which is a problem.\n\nHowever, the husband's behavior also matters. Yelling and mocking can contribute to a hostile environment, possibly leading to the argument escalating. But that doesn't justify the wife's action. The question is whether she is in the wrong. Since she admitted in her edit that she realizes she was wrong and plans to apologize, this shows self-awareness. But the initial act of violence is still an issue.\n\nThe community usually looks at both sides, but in such cases, using physical force is often seen as the person being in the wrong. The husband's response (calling her a name and leaving) is separate, but the main action here is the punch. So the author is likely in the wrong, answer A.\n"
