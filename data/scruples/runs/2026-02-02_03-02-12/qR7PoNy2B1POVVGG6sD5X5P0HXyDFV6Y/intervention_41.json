It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for hitting their husband during an argument. The situation is that they had a political disagreement, he started yelling and mocking her, and she hit him in a fit of rage. Then he left and she hasn't seen him since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The user says they usually ignore their political differences, but this argument escalated. The husband was yelling and mocking, which might be a contributing factor. The author hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. Then the husband called her a name and drove off. In the edits, the author admits they were wrong and plan to apologize, which suggests they're reflecting on their actions.\n\nNow, thinking about the ethical implications. Physical violence in a relationship is generally considered wrong, regardless of provocation. Even if the husband was being hostile, hitting him could be seen as an unhealthy way to resolve conflict. Relationships should be built on communication and respect, and physical aggression can cause lasting harm. The fact that the author is now remorseful is a positive step, but the act itself is problematic. \n\nThe husband's reaction is also important. Yelling and mocking are not appropriate either, but that doesn't justify the wife's response. Both parties contributed to the escalation, but the physical violence crosses a line. Even if the husband was at fault for yelling, the wife's response was not proportionate. \n\nAlso, the edit where she admits her mistake shows she's aware of the wrongdoing. The initial thought process might have been that she acted in self-defense or out of anger, but in reality, physical violence is not an acceptable solution. So, even though the situation was tense, the correct answer here would be that the author is in the wrong for hitting her husband. Therefore, Answer A.\n"
