It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they had an argument about politics, the husband was yelling and mocking, and the author hit him. The key points to consider are the context of the argument, the actions taken, and the legal implications.\n\nFirst, the argument was over political differences, specifically on abortion. They usually ignore their differences, but this time it escalated. The husband started yelling and mocking, which is a form of verbal abuse. The author, in a fit of rage, hit him with a closed fist to the face, causing a small bruise. Then the husband left, and the author hasn't seen him since.\n\nNow, in most legal systems, physical violence is not justified even if provoked by verbal abuse. Hitting someone, even in anger, is considered assault. The fact that it was a closed fist to the face, which can be considered more severe than a slap, might make it worse. The husband's response was to call the author a name and leave, which might indicate he didn't want to escalate further. However, verbal provocation doesn't typically justify a physical response. \n\nThe author did later acknowledge their mistake and plan to apologize, which shows some level of remorse. But the act itself is still a problem. Even if the husband was being abusive, using physical violence is not the solution. There are other ways to de-escalate a situation, like walking away or seeking help. \n\nAlso, the mention of a troll account pretending to be the husband is a red herring here. It doesn't affect the main question of whether the author is in the wrong. The edit about realizing the mistake and wanting to make up is good, but the initial action is still an issue.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author used physical violence in response to verbal provocation, which is generally not acceptable. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
