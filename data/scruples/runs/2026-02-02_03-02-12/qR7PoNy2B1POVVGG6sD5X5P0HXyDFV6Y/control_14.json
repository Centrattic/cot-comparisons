It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation involves political differences leading to yelling, mocking, and eventually a physical altercation.\n\nFirst, the key points: The husband was yelling and mocking her. She responded by hitting him with a closed fist, causing a bruise. Then he left, and she hasn't seen him since. In her edit, she says she realizes she was wrong and plans to apologize. \n\nNow, legal and ethical considerations. In most places, using physical force in a domestic dispute, even in response to verbal abuse, is generally considered assault. Mutual combat doesn't excuse it either. Even if he was provoking her, hitting him is not an acceptable response. \n\nShe mentions it was the first time, but that doesn't mitigate the wrongness of the action. The fact that she's planning to apologize shows she recognizes her mistake, but the act itself is still wrong. The husband's actions (yelling and mocking) were inappropriate, but that doesn't justify her hitting him. \n\nThe troll edit and the last edit about \"GAMERS RISE UP\" might be red herrings. The main issue is the physical violence. So the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. Even if the husband was at fault for yelling, the hit was an illegal act. Also, mutual escalation doesn't make either party right in committing assault.\n"
