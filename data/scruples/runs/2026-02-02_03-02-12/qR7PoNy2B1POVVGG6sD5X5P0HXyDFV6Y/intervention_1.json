It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who hit her husband was in the wrong. The situation started with a political argument, which escalated to her husband yelling and mocking her. In her rage, she hit him with a closed fist to the face, causing a small bruise. Then he left, calling her a \"bitch\" and driving off. She hasn't seen him since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They usually ignore their political differences, but this time it got intense. He started yelling and mocking her, which could be a trigger for her reaction. However, physical violence is a big deal. Even if provoked, hitting someone is not acceptable. The fact that she admitted it was wrong in her edit shows she realizes it, but the initial action is still an issue.\n\nAlso, the response from the husband\u2014calling her names and leaving\u2014might be his way of handling the situation, but that doesn't justify her hitting him. Both parties might have acted poorly, but the question is specifically about the author's wrongdoing. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, while the husband's behavior contributed, the author's action of hitting him crosses a line. Physical violence can escalate conflicts and lead to more serious issues. Even if it was a first-time incident, it's still a form of domestic violence, which is generally considered wrong regardless of context. \n\nHowever, the user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to check if that's accurate. The key here is that while both might have acted inappropriately, the physical act of hitting is a clear wrong. The husband's yelling and mocking might be disrespectful, but it doesn't make hitting an acceptable response. So the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because using physical violence is not justified, even in the heat of an argument.\n"
