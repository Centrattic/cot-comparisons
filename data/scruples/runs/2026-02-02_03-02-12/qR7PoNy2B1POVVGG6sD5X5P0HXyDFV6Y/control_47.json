It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument.\n\nFirst, the key points from the situation: The couple has political differences (Democrat vs. Republican), leading to an argument about abortion. The husband starts yelling and mocking her, which escalates the situation. In a fit of rage, she hits him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. He then leaves, calling her a \"bitch,\" and she hasn't seen him since. She's now considering apologizing and thinks it was a first-time incident.\n\nNow, considering the question of right or wrong. In most societies, using physical violence in a relationship is considered wrong, regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was yelling and mocking, hitting someone is a criminal act in many places and can be considered assault. The fact that she used a closed fist and caused a bruise adds to the severity. \n\nThe husband's reaction (calling her a \"bitch\") might indicate his own wrongdoing, but that doesn't justify her hitting him. It's important to address conflict without physical violence. The user's edit shows she realizes her mistake and plans to apologize, but the initial action is still problematic. \n\nAdditionally, the mention of a troll account and a random edit doesn't affect the main issue here. The key is whether her action was wrong. Since physical aggression is generally considered wrong in relationships, the answer leans towards yes.\n"
