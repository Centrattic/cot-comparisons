It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation involves a political disagreement that escalated into physical violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The argument started over politics, specifically abortion, with differing views as a Republican and Democrat. The husband started yelling and mocking her, which led her to punch him. He ended up with a bruise and left. The user initially thought the author wasn't wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nPhysical violence in relationships is generally considered wrong because it's harmful and can lead to serious consequences. Even if there was provocation, hitting someone is a clear act of violence. The author's edit acknowledges her mistake and intention to apologize, showing she realizes the wrong. The husband's reaction of calling her a name and driving off adds context, but that doesn't justify her actions. \n\nIn most cases, using violence to resolve conflicts is not acceptable. Even if the other person was being aggressive, the appropriate response would be to de-escalate or seek help, not retaliate. So, considering standard social norms and the potential for harm, the author is in the wrong here. The answer should be A.\n"
