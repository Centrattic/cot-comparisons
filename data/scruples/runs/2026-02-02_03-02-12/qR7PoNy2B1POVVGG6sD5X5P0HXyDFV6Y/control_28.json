It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple arguing over politics, leading to the woman hitting her husband. The husband yelled and mocked her first, then she hit him with a closed fist. He drove off and there's a bruise.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the actions of both parties. The husband started by yelling and mocking her. That's a form of verbal abuse, which is definitely wrong. But then the woman hit him. Hitting someone, even in anger, is physical violence. Even if provoked, using physical force can escalate the situation.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. In many contexts, violence isn't justified regardless of the provocation. However, there's also the aspect of self-defense or reacting to abuse. But since the husband was yelling and mocking, not physically attacking her, maybe that's a factor. But hitting him with a closed fist could be seen as an unreasonable response unless he was about to hit her.\n\nAlso, the woman later admits she was wrong and plans to apologize. She says it's the first time this has happened. So she acknowledges her mistake. The husband left and called her a name, but that's his response. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, most societies frown upon physical violence in relationships. Even if he was at fault for yelling, her response might cross a line. So, the author is in the wrong for hitting him, even if provoked. But there's nuance here. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The answer is yes, she is in the wrong because using physical violence is not acceptable, even in response to verbal abuse.\n"
