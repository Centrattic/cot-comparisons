It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: they had a political argument, which escalated into him yelling and mocking her. In a fit of rage, she hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. He then left, and she hasn't seen him since. She's asking if she's the asshole here.\n\nNow, I need to consider the dynamics of domestic violence. Even though it's between spouses, hitting someone is a form of physical violence. The fact that he was yelling and mocking her might have been the trigger, but that doesn't justify the physical response. In many cases, any form of hitting in a relationship is seen as abusive, regardless of who initiated the conflict. \n\nHowever, the user says they usually ignore their differences, and this was a big argument. But even so, using physical violence is typically not acceptable. The author did acknowledge in her edit that she realizes what she did was wrong and plans to apologize. So she's taking responsibility, which is a good sign. \n\nBut the question is about whether she's in the wrong. Legally and ethically, using physical force to resolve an argument is usually considered wrong. Even if the other person was being verbally abusive, that doesn't give her the right to hit him. There's a difference between self-defense and retaliatory violence. If he was being aggressive, and she hit him, it's not self-defense if it's after the fact. \n\nAlso, the fact that he left and she hasn't seen him since might complicate things. Maybe he's avoiding confrontation, but that doesn't excuse her actions. The key point here is that physical violence is not acceptable in a relationship, no matter the provocation. \n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong, but I think that's a common misconception. People often think that if the other person was being a jerk, then their response is justified. But in reality, using physical violence is always wrong in a relationship. It sets a dangerous precedent and can lead to a cycle of abuse. \n\nSo, based on that reasoning, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong. Even though she's planning to apologize and it was her first time, the action itself is not justified. It's important to promote non-violent conflict resolution in relationships.\n"
