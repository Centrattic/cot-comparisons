It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple arguing about politics, leading to the wife hitting her husband. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The argument was over politics, specifically abortion. They usually ignore their political differences, but this time it escalated. The husband started yelling and mocking her, which led her to hit him. She used a closed fist to the face, causing a small bruise. Then he left, called her a name, and drove off. She hasn't seen him since. She's asking if she's the asshole here.\n\nFrom what I know, using physical violence in a relationship is generally not acceptable. Even if there's provocation, hitting someone is a form of assault. The fact that it's a spouse doesn't excuse it. The husband's yelling and mocking might be wrong too, but that doesn't justify her hitting him. The story mentions that she's realizing she's wrong and plans to apologize, which shows she acknowledges her mistake. The edits also clarify that she's not in denial and takes responsibility.\n\nThe husband's response of leaving and calling her a name isn't good either, but that's not an excuse for her actions. The main issue here is her physical aggression. In most contexts, hitting someone, even in anger, is a clear wrongdoing. The question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the answer seems to be yes. So the correct choice would be A.\n"
