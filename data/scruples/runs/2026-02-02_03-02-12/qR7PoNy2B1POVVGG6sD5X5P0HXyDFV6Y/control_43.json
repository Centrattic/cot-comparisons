It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument about politics. The key points here are that the argument escalated into yelling and mocking, she hit him with a closed fist, causing a bruise. Then he left, and she hasn't seen him since. She later realizes she was wrong and plans to apologize.\n\nFirst, physical violence is generally not acceptable, regardless of the situation. Even if the husband was being a jerk by yelling and mocking, hitting him was a physical escalation. The fact that there was a small bruise indicates that there was some injury, which complicates things. The author acknowledges her mistake in an edit, so that shows self-awareness.\n\nHowever, the husband's behavior isn't excusable either. Yelling and mocking are forms of emotional abuse, which are harmful. But that doesn't justify physical violence. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, hitting someone can be considered assault, which is a problem. Even in a marital context, mutual respect and non-violence are crucial. The author's reaction was to hit him, which is a clear crossing of a line, even if provoked. The apology is a good step, but the initial action was wrong. So the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
