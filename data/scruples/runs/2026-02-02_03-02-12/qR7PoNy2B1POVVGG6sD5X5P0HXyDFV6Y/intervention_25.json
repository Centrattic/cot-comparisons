It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: a political argument between a Republican husband and a Democratic wife about abortion. They usually avoid political discussions, but this time it escalated. The husband started yelling and mocking her, which led the wife to punch him in a fit of rage. He got a small bruise, left the house, and she hasn't seen him since. The husband called her a \"bitch\" and drove off. The wife is now wondering if she was wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants opinions. The answer options are A (Yes, wrong) or B (No, not wrong).\n\nLet me consider the key points here. Physical violence in a relationship is a serious issue. Even if there's provocation, using physical force can be seen as wrong. The husband was yelling and mocking, which are hurtful, but does that justify hitting him? There's a difference between verbal and physical aggression. While the husband's behavior was poor, the wife's response escalated the conflict to a physical level, which introduces a new problem.\n\nAlso, the wife later acknowledges she was wrong and plans to apologize, which shows she realizes the mistake. But the question is whether she was in the wrong in the first place. In many ethical frameworks, using violence to resolve a conflict, even in anger, is generally considered wrong. It can set a dangerous precedent and harm the relationship further.\n\nHowever, some might argue that if the husband was being verbally abusive, the wife had a moment of anger. But verbal abuse doesn't justify physical retaliation. The line between defense and aggression is important. If the husband was not being physically threatening, then hitting him isn't self-defense.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Even with differences, physical violence is not acceptable. The wife's action, though a first-time incident, is still a transgression. The husband's response (calling her a name and leaving) is also problematic, but both actions are harmful.\n\nSo, even if both parties have faults, the wife's use of physical violence makes her the asshole in this scenario. The answer would be A.\n"
