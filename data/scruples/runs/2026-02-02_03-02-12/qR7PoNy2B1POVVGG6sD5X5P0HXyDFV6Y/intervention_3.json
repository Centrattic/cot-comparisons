It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation involves a political disagreement that escalated into yelling and then a physical altercation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the details given. The woman says they usually avoid political arguments, but this time it got big. Her husband started yelling and mocking her, and she hit him in a fit of rage. Then he left, and she hasn't seen him since. She's aware she might be in the wrong and plans to apologize.\n\nThe key here is whether hitting is justified. Even if provoked, using physical violence is generally not acceptable. Emotional reactions can lead to impulsive actions, but that doesn't make them right. The husband's yelling and mocking might have been wrong, but that doesn't excuse her hitting him. Both parties contributed to the escalation, but the physical act is a clear violation.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to assess based on the situation. The author acknowledges her mistake in an edit, which shows some self-awareness. However, the act itself is still wrong regardless of the provocation. There's no mention of self-defense here; it was a closed fist to the face, which is intentional harm. So, even if the husband was at fault for yelling, the woman's action crosses a line. Therefore, she is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
