It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: they had a political argument about abortion, which escalated. The husband started yelling and mocking her, leading her to punch him. She then apologizes and acknowledges it was wrong, but the question is whether she was in the wrong.\n\nThe options are A (yes, she's in the wrong) or B (no, she's not). The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to evaluate based on the situation.\n\nPhysical violence in any form is problematic. Even if provoked, hitting someone is a breach of trust and can cause harm. The husband's yelling and mocking might be inappropriate, but that doesn't justify a physical response. The fact that she later realizes it was wrong and plans to apologize is a positive step, but the action itself is still an issue. There's also the part where the husband left, maybe implying he's escalating the situation further by driving off. However, the key point is that using physical force in an argument, regardless of provocation, is generally considered wrong. So, even if the husband was being a jerk, punching him isn't acceptable. The author's action crosses a line, so the answer would likely be A.\n"
