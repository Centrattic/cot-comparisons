It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation involves a political disagreement that escalated, with the husband yelling and mocking her, leading her to punch him. There are some edits where she acknowledges her mistake and plans to apologize, but the original question is about whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The argument started over differing political views, which can be a sensitive topic. The husband's actions\u2014yelling and mocking\u2014are important here because they contributed to the escalation. However, the key point is the physical response. Even if provoked, using physical violence is generally considered a problem. The woman admits she acted out of rage and hit him with a closed fist, resulting in a bruise. \n\nThe response from the husband was to leave and call her a name. Now, the question is whether her action makes her the asshole. While the husband's behavior was inappropriate, hitting someone is a form of assault, which is legally and socially frowned upon regardless of the provocation. Even if both parties acted poorly, the act of hitting crosses a line into violence.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. The user might think that since the husband was being abusive, the punch was justified. However, in most ethical or legal assessments, physical retaliation isn't considered an appropriate response. The woman's acknowledgment of her mistake in the edit suggests she realizes this, but the original question is about whether she's in the wrong. \n\nAlso, the edits mention a troll account pretending to be her husband and a racist comment, which might be distractions. The main issue is the initial act. The answer should focus on the physical assault. Even if the husband's actions were at fault, the woman's response is still problematic. So the answer is likely A, yes, she is in the wrong.\n"
