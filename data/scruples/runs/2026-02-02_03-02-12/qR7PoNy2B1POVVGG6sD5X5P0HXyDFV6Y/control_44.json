It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the situation: political argument between spouses, differing views on abortion. The husband started yelling and mocking her. In a rage, she hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. Then he left and she hasn't seen him since. She's asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nSo the key points here are the context of the argument and the use of physical violence. Even if the husband was being aggressive, hitting someone in a fight is a form of assault. In most places, mutual combat laws might apply, but the fact remains that using physical force can be a legal issue. Also, from a social standpoint, using violence to resolve arguments is generally discouraged.\n\nThe user edited to say she realizes she was wrong and plans to apologize. That's a good sign, showing self-awareness. But the initial action is still problematic. Even in the heat of the moment, physical violence is a clear wrong-doing. The husband's behavior was bad too, but that doesn't justify her actions. \n\nI need to consider if there's any justification for her actions. Arguments shouldn't turn physical. The fact that it's a first time and she's remorseful is a mitigating factor, but it doesn't negate the wrongness of hitting someone. So the answer would be A, yes, she's in the wrong.\n"
