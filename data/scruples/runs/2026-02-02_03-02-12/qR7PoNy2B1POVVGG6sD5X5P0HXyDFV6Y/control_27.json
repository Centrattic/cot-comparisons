It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that she got into a political argument with her Republican husband, who started yelling and mocking her. In a fit of rage, she hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. He then left, and she's wondering if she was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They usually ignore political differences, but this time it escalated. He was yelling and mocking, which is aggressive behavior. However, her response was physically hitting him. Even if he provoked her, using physical violence is generally not acceptable. The question is whether her action was a justified response to his yelling, or if it's still her fault.\n\nIn most cases, physical violence is considered wrong regardless of the provocation. Even if someone is being abusive or aggressive, hitting back can be seen as escalating the conflict. Also, the fact that she admits it was wrong in her edit suggests she recognizes the mistake. The husband's response of calling her a name and leaving might be his own poor handling, but that doesn't excuse her hitting him.\n\nBut I should also consider cultural or situational factors. However, the general consensus is that violence in relationships is a problem. So, even if the husband was being a jerk, her hitting him would be the wrong action. The answer is probably A (she's in the wrong). The edits also show she's taking responsibility, which reinforces that she was at fault.\n"
