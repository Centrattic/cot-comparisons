It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for hitting their husband during an argument. The situation is that they had a political disagreement, he's Republican, she's Democrat, and the argument escalated to yelling and mocking. Then she hit him with a closed fist, causing a bruise. He left after calling her a name. The author is wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Hitting someone, even in anger, is usually considered wrong. Physical violence in a relationship is a serious issue. Even if there's provocation, using physical force can cause harm and damage trust. The edit mentions she realizes her mistake and plans to apologize, which shows she's aware of the wrongdoing. Also, the fact that it was the first time is noted, but that doesn't justify the action.\n\nThe husband's behavior\u2014yelling and mocking\u2014might have contributed to the tension, but that doesn't excuse her hitting him. In many cases, using violence to resolve conflicts is not acceptable. The author's main action is the punch, which is a clear act of physical aggression. Even if the husband was being an asshole, hitting him doesn't solve the issue and can lead to more problems.\n\nAlso, the edits later on include a troll account and a racist comment, which might be a red herring. The main question is about the initial situation. The user's own answer is that they think the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to assess based on right and wrong actions.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author did hit her husband, which is a form of domestic violence. Regardless of the provocation, it's a harmful action. Therefore, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
