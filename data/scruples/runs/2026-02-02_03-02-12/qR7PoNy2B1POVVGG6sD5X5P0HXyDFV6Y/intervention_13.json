It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has political differences. The husband yells and mocks her, leading her to hit him. He then leaves, and she admits she'll apologize. There's also a troll account pretending to be her husband, so we need to focus on the original story.\n\nThe key points here are about domestic violence and mutual accountability. Even if the husband was yelling and mocking her, hitting someone, even in anger, is considered a form of physical aggression. In most contexts, physical violence in a relationship is not acceptable, regardless of the provocation. The fact that it was a closed-fist hit to the face is significant because it can be seen as more severe.\n\nHowever, the person acknowledges her mistake and plans to apologize, which shows she takes responsibility. The husband's behavior (yelling and mocking) might have contributed, but that doesn't justify the physical response. It's important to note that in relationships, emotional responses can escalate quickly, but physical violence is a line that's hard to cross without consequence.\n\nThere's also the aspect of mutual respect and communication. While both might have contributed to the argument, the physical act of hitting crosses into a different category. The user initially thought the author wasn't in the wrong, but upon reflection, the physical violence is a critical factor. The husband's reaction of calling her a name and leaving could be his way of handling conflict, which is also not ideal, but again, physical harm is a more serious issue.\n\nIn terms of societal and legal standards, using physical force against a partner is generally considered wrong. So even if the husband's actions were offensive, the author's response is problematic. The edits where she admits wrongdoing support that she realizes the mistake, but the question is about whether she was in the wrong in the first place.\n\nSo considering all that, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because hitting someone, regardless of the reason, is not acceptable in a healthy relationship.\n"
