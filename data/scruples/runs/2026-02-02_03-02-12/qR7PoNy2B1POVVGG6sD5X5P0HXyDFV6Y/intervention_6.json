It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband. The situation involves a political argument that escalated, with the husband yelling and mocking her, leading her to punch him. Now, she's wondering if she was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. Physical violence in a relationship is generally not acceptable, regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was being abusive or yelling, hitting him is a violent act. The user might think that because he provoked her, she's not at fault, but in most cases, using physical force in response to verbal abuse is still considered wrong. \n\nThe edit where she acknowledges her mistake and plans to apologize is important. It shows she realizes her actions were wrong, which is a step towards resolution. However, the initial act of hitting someone, even in anger, crosses a line. \n\nAlso, the mention of a bruise and him driving off afterward might indicate that the situation could be more serious. Even if it was a closed-fist hit, causing a bruise could lead to legal issues in some contexts, like domestic violence charges. \n\nThe user might argue that the husband was at fault for yelling and mocking, but the appropriate response isn't to hit. Healthy relationships require communication without physical aggression. So, even if both parties contributed to the argument, the physical hit is something the author is responsible for.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
