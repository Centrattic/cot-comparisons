It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they had a political argument with their husband over abortion, which escalated. The husband started yelling and mocking her, and in a fit of rage, she hit him with a closed fist. He ended up with a small bruise and then left. Now, the author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for punching him or if he's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Political arguments can get heated, especially when they touch on sensitive issues like abortion. The fact that they usually ignore their political differences but this time it got out of hand is important. The husband's behavior\u2014yelling and mocking\u2014might have contributed to the escalation. However, physical violence is still a significant issue regardless of the context.\n\nThe key point here is that the author used physical force. Even if provoked, hitting someone is considered a form of assault in most places. The husband's response of calling her a \"bitch\" and leaving might indicate that the situation was mutual, but that doesn't justify the physical act. The author acknowledges in the edit that they realize they were wrong and plan to apologize, which shows some accountability. However, the act itself is a problem.\n\nAlso, there's the note about a troll account, but that's probably just a red herring to get more responses. The main question is about the initial action. So, while the husband's yelling might have been the trigger, the author's response crosses a line into physical aggression. In many societies, using physical violence in an argument, even in a heated moment, is considered wrong and can have legal consequences. The fact that the husband left and there's a bruise adds to the severity.\n\nBut then again, maybe the author felt threatened or that the situation was escalating beyond words. However, even in self-defense scenarios, the response should be proportionate. A single punch doesn't seem like self-defense but rather an aggressive act. So, considering all that, the author did something wrong, even if they were provoked. The answer is likely A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
