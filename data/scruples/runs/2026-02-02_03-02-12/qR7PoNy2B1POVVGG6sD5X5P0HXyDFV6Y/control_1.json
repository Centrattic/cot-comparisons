It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after hitting her husband during an argument. The initial scenario is an argument over politics, which escalated when the husband started yelling and mocking her. She then hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. He left afterward, and now she's questioning if she was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They usually avoid political arguments, so this was significant. The husband's response was yelling and mocking, which could be seen as aggressive. The author's reaction was hitting him. Physical violence in a relationship is generally not acceptable, regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was being aggressive, hitting someone is a form of assault. \n\nShe later edited her post to admit she realized she was wrong and plans to apologize. That shows she acknowledges her mistake. However, the initial act of hitting is a problem. The question is whether she's in the wrong. From a legal and ethical standpoint, using physical force against a partner is wrong, even in the heat of an argument. It's important to resolve conflicts without violence. The husband's behavior was also inappropriate by yelling and mocking, but that doesn't justify her hitting him. \n\nThe edits might show her self-awareness, but the question is about whether she was in the wrong at the time of the incident. The answer would still be yes. So, the correct choice is A.\n"
