It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument about politics. \n\nFirst, the key points from the situation: They had a political argument, he's Republican, she's Democrat, they usually avoid discussing it. This time, he started yelling and mocking her, which led her to hit him with a closed fist. Then he left, she hasn't seen him since. She's questioning if she's the asshole or if he's being a baby.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the use of physical violence. Even if the argument was heated, hitting someone is a form of assault. The fact that he was yelling and mocking her might be a trigger, but that doesn't justify the physical response. The writer acknowledges her mistake in an edit, saying she'll apologize, which shows she realizes it was wrong.\n\nAlso, in many legal systems, mutual combat in a relationship doesn't excuse physical altercations. Both parties might be at fault for escalating the situation, but the act of hitting someone is generally a clear violation of acceptable behavior. The husband's reaction of calling her a name and driving off could indicate his own faults, but that doesn't negate her responsibility for the punch.\n\nEven if both had contributed to the argument, the line between verbal and physical conflict is important. Verbal arguments can be intense, but physical violence crosses a boundary. The edit where she admits her mistake reinforces that she understands it was wrong. So, the answer is likely yes, she's in the wrong for using physical force.\n"
