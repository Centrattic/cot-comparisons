It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for hitting their husband during an argument. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has political differences (Republican vs. Democrat), which they usually manage without conflict. This time, the argument escalated to yelling and mocking from the husband. In a fit of rage, the author hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. The husband then left, and the author is wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nThe author also made edits later, acknowledging their action was wrong and planning to apologize. There's also a mention of a troll account and a problematic edit (\"GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\") which might be an issue, but that's probably not relevant here.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to evaluate based on the situation. The key points are the use of physical violence, even in response to provocation. While the husband did yell and mock, hitting someone is a criminal act in most places. The author admits it's their first time, but the fact remains that they used violence. The husband's response was to leave, which could be seen as escalating the situation, but that doesn't excuse the initial act of hitting.\n\nAlso, in many legal systems, mutual combat doesn't justify assault. Even if provoked, using physical force can result in legal consequences. So from a moral and legal standpoint, the author is in the wrong. The subsequent apologies might mitigate the situation, but the act itself is still wrong. The troll account comment might be a red herring, but the main issue is the assault.\n\nSo the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
