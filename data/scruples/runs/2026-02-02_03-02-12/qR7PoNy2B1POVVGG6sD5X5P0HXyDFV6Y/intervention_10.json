It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation is a political disagreement between spouses, which escalated into yelling and physical aggression.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The woman and her husband have political differences, which they usually ignore. This time, the argument got big, he started yelling and mocking her, and in a fit of rage, she punched him. There's a closed fist hit to the face causing a small bruise. Then he left, and she hasn't seen him since. She's asking if she's the asshole, and in an edit, she acknowledges she was wrong and plans to apologize. Also, someone made a troll account pretending to be her husband, which is noted as not her.\n\nNow, the user's own opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, but they want others' thoughts. The answer options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nLegal perspective: In many jurisdictions, using physical force in a domestic dispute can be considered assault, even between spouses. A closed-fist hit to the face causing a bruise is likely a criminal offense. So legally, she could be in trouble.\n\nMoral perspective: The husband started yelling and mocking, which might be seen as provocation. However, violence is generally not acceptable as a response. Even if provoked, hitting someone is a breach of peaceful conflict resolution. The woman admits she was wrong in an edit, which suggests she recognizes her mistake.\n\nRelationship context: The edit says it's the first time this happened and they can make up. But physical violence can have lasting effects on a relationship. The husband's reaction of calling her a name and driving off complicates things, but his actions might be part of the cycle of conflict.\n\nTroll edit: The mention of a troll account might be a red herring or an attempt to deflect blame. The last edit about \"GAMERS RISE UP\" seems like a random addition, possibly to confuse or distract.\n\nConsidering all factors: While the husband's behavior (yelling, mocking) contributed to the argument, the woman's response with physical violence is problematic. Even if it was a first-time incident, hitting someone is a clear violation of non-violence in a relationship. The fact that she later acknowledges her mistake supports that she was wrong.\n\nSo, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
