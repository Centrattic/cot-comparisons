It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation involves a political disagreement, leading to yelling and mockery from the husband, which prompted her to hit him. She later realized her mistake and plans to apologize.\n\nFirst, physical violence in any relationship is a serious issue. Even if provoked, hitting someone is not acceptable. The husband's yelling and mocking might have contributed to the tension, but that doesn't justify a physical response. The woman admits she was in the wrong in her edit, which shows self-awareness. However, the initial action of hitting him is still a problem. Relationships require communication and conflict resolution without physical aggression. While the husband's behavior was disrespectful, the appropriate response would be to de-escalate, not retaliate physically. The wife's action could escalate the conflict and harm the relationship. So, despite the provocation, she is in the wrong here. The answer should be A.\n"
