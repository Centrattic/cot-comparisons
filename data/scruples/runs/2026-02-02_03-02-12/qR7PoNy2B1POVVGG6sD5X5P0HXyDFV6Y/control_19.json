It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting their husband during an argument. \n\nFirst, the situation: they had a political argument, the husband was yelling and mocking her. She got angry and hit him with a closed fist. He left, got a bruise, and she hasn't seen him since. She's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nLooking at the details, physical violence in a relationship is a big deal. Even if there was provocation, hitting someone is generally considered wrong. The fact that he was yelling and mocking might explain her anger, but that doesn't justify hitting him. The edits show she acknowledges her mistake and plans to apologize, which is a positive step, but the initial action is still violent. \n\nIn most contexts, using physical force in an argument leads to the person who hit being at fault. Emotional responses don't excuse violent behavior. Also, the husband's reaction of calling her a name and leaving might be his way of handling it, but that doesn't make her actions okay. \n\nSo the answer is A, yes, the author is in the wrong because she used physical violence, which is generally not acceptable regardless of the circumstances.\n"
