It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting their husband during an argument about politics. The author mentions that the husband started yelling and mocking them, which led to them hitting him. The husband then left and hasn't been seen since. The author edited the post to say they realize they were wrong and will apologize, and that this was the first time something like this happened.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the situation. Physical violence in a relationship is generally not acceptable, regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was being abusive or insulting, using physical force can escalate the situation and cause harm. The author admits in an edit that they realize their actions were wrong, which is a sign of self-awareness, but the initial act still needs to be evaluated.\n\nDomestic violence is a serious issue, and any instance of physical aggression should be addressed. While it's important to acknowledge that the husband's behavior (yelling and mocking) might have been a trigger, that doesn't justify hitting him. The key point here is whether the author's actions were a proportionate response. Hitting someone, even in anger, is a form of assault and can have legal and emotional consequences.\n\nThe author's edits show they're trying to take responsibility, which is commendable. However, the initial act of hitting someone is still a problem. The user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. Even if the husband was at fault in the argument, the author's response crosses a line into physical violence, which is not acceptable. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong, because hitting someone is never justified, regardless of the reason.\n"
