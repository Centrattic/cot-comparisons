It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who hit their husband during an argument is in the wrong. The situation involves a political argument about abortion, leading to yelling and mockery from the husband, which escalated into the wife hitting him with a closed fist. The husband then left and she hasn't seen him since. She acknowledges her mistake in the edit and says she'll apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if this is a case of self-defense or mutual combat. The key factors here are the level of provocation, the intent, and the proportionality of the response. The husband was yelling and mocking her, which is verbal abuse but not necessarily physical. The wife responded with a physical attack. Even if provoked, using physical violence can be considered wrong because it's not a proportionate response to verbal abuse. There's also the aspect of mutual escalation; the husband left, but the initial act of hitting was initiated by the wife. \n\nIn most legal and social contexts, hitting someone, even if provoked, is considered an act of assault. The fact that she later acknowledges her mistake and wants to apologize might mitigate her responsibility, but the action itself is still wrong. Self-defense typically requires a threat of imminent physical harm, which wasn't present here. The husband's actions were verbal, not physical, so her response crosses a line. Additionally, the edit where she admits fault shows she recognizes this, but the question is about whether she's in the wrong, not just her perception of it.\n\nAnother angle: in relationships, using physical violence to resolve conflicts is generally discouraged. Even if tensions are high, hitting someone is not an acceptable solution. The husband's behavior was inappropriate too, but the wife's response escalated the situation to a new level. So, while both might have contributed to the argument, the wife's action of hitting is the key point here. Therefore, the answer is A; she is in the wrong.\n"
