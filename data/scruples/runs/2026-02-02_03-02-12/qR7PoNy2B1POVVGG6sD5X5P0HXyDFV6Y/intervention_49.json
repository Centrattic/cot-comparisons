It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The key points here are the argument context, the escalation, and the physical response.\n\nFirst, the argument was about politics, specifically abortion. They usually avoid political discussions, but this time it escalated. The husband started yelling and mocking her, which led to her hitting him with a closed fist. He left with a small bruise and called her a name before driving off.\n\nThe user initially thought the author might not be in the wrong, but after some reflection, the author herself acknowledged in an edit that she realized her mistake and plans to apologize. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, using physical violence in an argument, even if provoked, is generally considered wrong. Intimate partner violence is a serious issue, and hitting someone, regardless of the situation, crosses a line. The husband's yelling and mocking might justify some emotional response, but physical action is not acceptable. The author's own edit showing regret supports the idea that she did something wrong, even if it was a first-time occurrence.\n\nHowever, the husband's behavior\u2014yelling and mocking\u2014also contributed to the escalation. But the question is specifically about the author's actions. So, even if the husband was at fault for yelling, the author's response of hitting him is the act in question here. The answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because physical violence isn't justified, regardless of provocation.\n\nAlso, the author mentions it was the first time and she's planning to apologize, which shows she takes responsibility. But the act itself remains wrong. So, the conclusion would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
