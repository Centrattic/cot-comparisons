It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. \n\nFirst, the situation: a political argument between a husband and wife. They usually avoid discussing politics, but this time it escalated. He started yelling and mocking her, which led her to hit him with a closed fist. He left after a bruise appeared, and now she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nLooking at the details, physical violence in a relationship is generally frowned upon, regardless of the context. Even if there was provocation, hitting someone is a form of assault. The fact that she admits it was wrong in her edit shows she recognizes the mistake. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nIn most cases, using physical force in an argument is considered wrong because it can lead to harm and escalates conflict. The husband's yelling and mocking might be contributing factors, but that doesn't justify the punch. The key point is that violence isn't an acceptable response. \n\nAlso, the user is asking from an ethical standpoint. While the husband's behavior was inappropriate, the wife's action crossed a line. Apologizing is a step towards making amends, but the act itself is generally seen as wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
