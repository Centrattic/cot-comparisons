It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for hitting her husband. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: an argument about politics, leading to yelling and mocking. The wife hits him with a closed fist, causing a bruise. He then leaves. The question is whether she was wrong.\n\nSo, physical violence in a relationship is generally considered wrong. Even if there's an argument, hitting someone is a form of abuse. The context here is important. The husband was yelling and mocking her, which is bad behavior, but that doesn't justify her hitting him. The user wants to know if she's in the wrong.\n\nLooking at the edits, she later realizes her mistake and plans to apologize. That shows self-awareness. The troll account edit might be a red herring or an attempt to add drama. The main issue is the act of hitting.\n\nIn most cases, using physical force to resolve an argument is unacceptable. So, even if the husband was being aggressive, the wife's response was not appropriate. The answer should be A (Yes, she's in the wrong) because using violence escalates the conflict and is not a valid response, regardless of the provocation. The fact that it was the first time and she's planning to apologize might mitigate it, but the action itself is wrong.\n"
