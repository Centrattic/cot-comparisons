It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation is a political disagreement that escalated, leading to the husband yelling and mocking her, which caused her to hit him. She later realized she was wrong and wants to apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In most places, hitting someone, even a spouse, is considered assault. So legally, the author could be in the wrong. But there's also context: mutual escalation of conflict. However, using physical violence is not acceptable regardless of provocation.\n\nThe husband's actions (yelling and mocking) might be wrong, but that doesn't justify a physical response. The key point is that violence is never the appropriate reaction, even in heated arguments. The author acknowledges her mistake in the edit, which shows she understands it was wrong. The husband driving off might be an overreaction too, but that doesn't excuse the punch.\n\nAlso, the edits show she's taking responsibility, which is important. The fact that she's seeking advice and admits fault suggests she's aware of her wrongdoing. The initial question is whether she's the asshole (ITA). The community's response would likely say yes, because violence isn't acceptable. The husband's behavior was poor, but her response crossed a line.\n\nSo the answer should be A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
