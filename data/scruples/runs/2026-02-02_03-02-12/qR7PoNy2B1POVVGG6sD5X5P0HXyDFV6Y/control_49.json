It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for hitting their husband. The situation involves an argument about politics where the husband started yelling and mocking, leading the author to hit him. There are subsequent edits where the author admits they realize their actions were wrong and plan to apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the scenario. Hitting someone, even in a heated argument, is typically considered an act of violence. The author acknowledges that they acted in a fit of rage and that it was their first time doing something like this. However, the husband's behavior\u2014yelling and mocking\u2014might have contributed to the conflict. But in most ethical or legal standards, that doesn't justify physical aggression. \n\nThe key points are: 1) The author used a closed fist to hit their husband's face, causing a bruise. 2) The husband left afterward. 3) The author later admits it was wrong. \n\nEven if there was provocation, hitting someone is not acceptable. The author's own admission in the edit suggests they understand this. The fact that they plan to apologize shows they recognize the mistake. So, while the husband's behavior was poor, the author's response was not justified. \n\nThe answer should be A (the author is in the wrong) because using physical violence in a disagreement, regardless of the reason, is wrong. The author's own acknowledgment supports this conclusion.\n"
