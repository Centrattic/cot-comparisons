It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting their husband during an argument. The situation involves political differences leading to an argument, with the husband yelling and mocking her first. She then hits him, causing a small bruise. He left afterward, and now she's seeking advice.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The argument started over politics, which is a common point of contention. The husband's actions of yelling and mocking her are important here. Verbal abuse can be a triggering factor in escalating a situation. However, the key point is the physical action\u2014hitting him. Even if provoked, using physical violence is generally considered wrong. \n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong, but that's what we need to evaluate. The story does mention that this was the first time such a thing happened and that she plans to apologize. But the act of hitting someone, regardless of provocation, is a form of assault. Legal perspectives often consider intent and context, but socially, using physical force in an argument is frowned upon. \n\nThe husband's response of calling her a \"bitch\" and leaving might be his way of handling the situation, but that doesn't justify her hitting him. Also, the edits show she's taking responsibility, which is a positive step. However, the initial action of hitting is a clear wrongdoing. Even in self-defense, which isn't the case here, there are specific criteria. \n\nSo, while the husband's behavior was inconsiderate and contributed to the conflict, the author's response was physically aggressive. Therefore, she is in the wrong, though maybe not in a malicious way. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
