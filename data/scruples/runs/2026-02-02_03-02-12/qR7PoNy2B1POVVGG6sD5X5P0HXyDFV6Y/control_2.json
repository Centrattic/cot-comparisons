It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that she and her husband had a political argument about abortion, he's Republican, she's Democrat. He started yelling and mocking her, and in a rage, she hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. He then left, and she hasn't seen him since. She's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. Physical violence in a relationship is generally a big issue. Even if the argument started with him yelling and mocking, hitting him is a form of physical aggression. While self-defense could be a factor, the scenario here seems to be that she hit him in a fit of rage during an argument, not necessarily to defend herself from physical harm. \n\nIn most legal and ethical contexts, using physical force in an argument where there's no immediate threat to one's safety is typically seen as wrong. Even if the other person was being verbally abusive, that doesn't justify hitting them. Also, the fact that she later acknowledges her mistake in an edit shows she realizes it was wrong, but the question is whether it's her fault in the first place.\n\nThe husband's response of calling her a name and driving off might be his way of reacting, but that doesn't excuse her action. Both parties might have acted inappropriately, but the question is specifically about her. The key point here is that she used physical violence, which is generally considered a wrongdoing, regardless of the provocation. So, the answer would be A.\n"
