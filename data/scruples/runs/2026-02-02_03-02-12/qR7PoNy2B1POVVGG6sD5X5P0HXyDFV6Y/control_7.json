It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that during a political argument, the husband was yelling and mocking her, and she punched him, leading to him leaving. She's wondering if she's the one at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. Physical violence is generally considered wrong in a relationship, regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was being disrespectful, hitting him with a closed fist is an aggressive act. The fact that this was the first time she's done this might be a mitigating factor, but it doesn't excuse the action itself. \n\nAlso, the husband's response of calling her a \"bitch\" and driving off complicates things, but his behavior doesn't justify her physical retaliation. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since the act of hitting someone, even in anger, is typically not acceptable, the answer would lean towards A. \n\nBut wait, there's an edit where she admits she was wrong and plans to apologize. That might show she acknowledges her mistake, but the original action still stands. The community might still consider her the asshole for using physical violence.\n\nAnother thing to note: the user included a racist edit at the end (\"GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\"), which is a red flag. It might indicate trolling or that the post isn't genuine. However, the original question is about the situation described before the edits. The troll account edit could be a distraction, but the main scenario remains.\n\nIn AITA posts, the general consensus is that physical violence is a big no. So, despite mutual issues, the author's action is likely seen as the wrong one here. The husband's yelling and mocking are bad, but that doesn't make her hitting him okay. So the answer should be A.\n"
