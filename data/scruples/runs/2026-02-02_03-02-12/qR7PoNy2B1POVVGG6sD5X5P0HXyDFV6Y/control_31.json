It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a couple arguing about politics, specifically about abortion. The husband is a Republican, and the author is a Democrat. They usually avoid political discussions, but this time the argument escalated. The husband started yelling and mocking the author, which led her to hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. After that, he left, and now she's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Physical violence in relationships is generally a big no-no. Even if there's an argument, hitting someone is not acceptable. The author admits that this was her first time acting this way and she plans to apologize. But does that make it okay? No, because the action itself is wrong regardless of first-time status. Intentions don't excuse violence.\n\nThen, the husband's response: he called her a \"bitch\" and drove off. His reaction is also problematic. Using derogatory language is disrespectful, but it's not physical violence. However, his response might be a consequence of her action. The question is whether her action was justified. Even if he was yelling and mocking, that doesn't give her the right to hit him. Mutual escalation of conflict can be an issue, but physical aggression crosses a line.\n\nAlso, the author made an edit acknowledging her mistake and planning to apologize. That shows some self-awareness, but acknowledging the mistake doesn't erase the wrongdoing. The key point is that physical violence isn't a valid response to any argument, no matter how heated.\n\nThe troll account edit is probably a distraction, but the main issue is the initial question. The answer here hinges on whether using physical violence is ever acceptable in a relationship. Generally, no. So the author is in the wrong. The husband's actions (yelling) are bad too, but they don't justify the punch. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
