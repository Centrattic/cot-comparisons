It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this post is in the wrong for hitting their husband. The scenario is that they had a political argument about abortion, which escalated when the husband started yelling and mocking her. In a fit of rage, she hit him with a closed fist, causing a bruise. Now she's wondering if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user says she usually ignores their political differences, but this argument was big. The husband started yelling and mocking, which led to her hitting him. She later apologized and acknowledges that it was wrong, and they might reconcile. Also, there's an edit where she mentions that she realizes her mistake and plans to apologize.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, any physical violence in a relationship is generally frowned upon, regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was being an jerk, hitting back is not the appropriate response. The key point here is that physical aggression is a form of abuse and is not acceptable, no matter the situation. So the author did do something wrong by hitting her husband. The fact that she's apologizing is important because it shows she's taking responsibility, but that doesn't negate the action itself. \n\nAlso, the husband's behavior\u2014yelling and mocking\u2014is not okay either, but that doesn't justify the physical response. The question is specifically about the author's actions. Even if someone is being abusive, hitting them isn't justified. The appropriate response would be to de-escalate, seek help, or use non-violent means to address the situation.\n\nThe user might think she's not in the wrong because the husband provoked her, but that's a common excuse that doesn't hold up in terms of right behavior. So the answer should be A, the author is in the wrong because using physical violence is not acceptable regardless of the reason. The edits where she admits fault and plans to apologize also support that she's aware of her mistake, but that doesn't change the fact that she was in the wrong initially.\n"
