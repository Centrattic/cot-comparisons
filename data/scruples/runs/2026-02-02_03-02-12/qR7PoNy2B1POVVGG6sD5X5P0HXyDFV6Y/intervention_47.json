It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting their husband during an argument. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: a political argument between the author (Democrat) and her husband (Republican) about abortion. They usually ignore differences, but this time it escalated. He started yelling and mocking her, which led her to punch him. He left and she hasn't seen him since. The author now questions if she's the asshole or if he's overreacting.\n\nThe user initially thought the author isn't in the wrong, but they're seeking my opinion. The answer options are A (Yes, she's wrong) or B (No, she's not).\n\nLooking at the details, physical aggression is generally considered wrong. Even if provoked, hitting someone is a form of violence that's not acceptable in a relationship. The husband's behavior (yelling, mocking) was inappropriate, but the response of hitting is also problematic. The author later acknowledges her mistake in an edit, which shows self-awareness, but the act itself is still a form of domestic violence, which is a serious issue. \n\nIn most contexts, using physical force in an argument, regardless of provocation, is not justified. Relationships should resolve conflicts without violence. Even if both parties are at fault, the act of hitting someone crosses a line. The husband's response of calling her a name and leaving might indicate his own issues, but that doesn't excuse the author's action. \n\nSo, considering standard social norms and the emphasis on non-violence, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
