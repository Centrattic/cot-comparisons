It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple arguing about politics, leading to the woman hitting her husband. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, physical violence in any relationship is a big issue. Even if the argument was intense, hitting someone is generally considered wrong. The fact that it was a closed-fist hit to the face is significant. The husband did yell and mock her, which might have provoked her, but that doesn't justify the physical response. \n\nThe user also mentions that the husband left and called her a \"bitch,\" which is disrespectful, but again, hitting him is not the appropriate reaction. The author later edited the post to say she realizes she was wrong and plans to apologize. That shows some self-awareness, but the action itself is still problematic. \n\nIn terms of accountability, even if both sides had issues, physical aggression usually falls on the person who used it. The husband's behavior was not okay (yelling, mocking), but the author's response crossed a line. The fact that this was the first time might mitigate some of the blame, but it doesn't erase the wrongdoing. \n\nAlso, the edit about someone pretending to be her husband is a red herring here. The main issue is her action. So, based on this, the author is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
