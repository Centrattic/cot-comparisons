It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument.\n\nFirst, the situation: they had a political argument, which escalated. The husband was yelling and mocking her, which can be really triggering. In a fit of rage, she hit him with a closed fist, causing a bruise. Then he left and hasn't been seen since. The author is questioning if she was wrong or if he's overreacting.\n\nNow, considering the context. Physical violence in relationships is a big deal. Even if the husband was being aggressive or mocking, hitting him is still a violent act. The user initially thinks the author isn't wrong, but after the edit, the author admits she realizes her mistake and plans to apologize. So maybe she's reflecting on her actions.\n\nBut the question is whether she was in the wrong. From a general standpoint, using physical force, even in anger, is typically seen as wrong because it can escalate conflicts and cause harm. However, if there was provocation (like yelling and mocking), some might argue it's in self-defense, but that's more for immediate threats. Mocking and yelling might not justify a punch.\n\nAlso, the author's edit shows she acknowledges her mistake, which is a good sign, but the initial action is still there. The community responses might vary, but legally and socially, using physical violence is usually frowned upon, regardless of the reason. So even if the husband was at fault in the argument, hitting him makes the author responsible for the physical aggression. Therefore, she's in the wrong.\n"
