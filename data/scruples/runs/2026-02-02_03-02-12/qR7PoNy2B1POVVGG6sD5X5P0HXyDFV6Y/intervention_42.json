It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The scenario involves political differences leading to a heated argument where the husband yells and mocks her, prompting her to hit him with a closed fist. He ends up with a bruise and then leaves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The woman usually ignores political differences, but this time it escalated. The husband's behavior\u2014yelling and mocking\u2014might have contributed to her reaction. However, the key issue here is the physical violence. Even if provoked, hitting someone is a form of assault, which is a legal issue. In most jurisdictions, mutual combat doesn't excuse assault, especially when there's a power dynamic in a marital relationship.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but after the edits, she acknowledges her mistake and plans to apologize. The second edit shows some self-awareness, which is good, but the initial action remains. The first impulse is to say A (she's in the wrong) because hitting is wrong regardless of provocation. However, some might argue that the husband's actions led to her reaction. But the law typically doesn't make exceptions for \"provocation\" in such cases. Also, in a relationship, both parties should manage conflicts without violence. Even if he was being abusive, her response was also abusive. So, both acted wrongly, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she initiated physical violence, the answer leans towards A.\n"
