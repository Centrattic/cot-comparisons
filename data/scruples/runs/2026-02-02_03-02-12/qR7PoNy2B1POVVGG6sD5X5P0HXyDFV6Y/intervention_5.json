It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during a political argument. She mentions they usually avoid discussing politics but this time it escalated. He started yelling and mocking her, which led her to hit him. Now he's gone, and she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Physical violence in a relationship is a big deal. Even if there's a history of arguments, using physical force is generally seen as wrong. The fact that she hit him with a closed fist to the face is significant. While he was yelling and mocking her, which is hurtful, that doesn't justify a physical response. The key point here is that violence is never acceptable, regardless of provocation.\n\nShe did acknowledge in her edit that she realizes her mistake and plans to apologize. That's a positive step, showing she's aware of her actions. But the initial act of hitting is still problematic. The husband's reaction of calling her a name and leaving might have been his way of handling the situation, but that doesn't excuse the physical aggression.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to check if that's accurate. Even if the argument was heated, the response was physical. Most people would agree that hitting someone, even in anger, is wrong. So the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). But why? Because violence is not an acceptable way to resolve conflicts, no matter the reason. The fact that it was a first-time occurrence doesn't negate the action. The husband's yelling and mocking are bad, but they don't justify a punch. The author should have found another way to de-escalate the situation instead of resorting to physical violence.\n"
