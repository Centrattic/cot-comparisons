It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking if the person who punched their husband is in the wrong. So, the scenario is a political argument between a Republican husband and a Democratic wife about abortion. The argument escalates, he yells and mocks her, she hits him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. Then he leaves, calling her a name. She hasn't seen him since and is questioning if she was the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points here. Physical violence is a big issue in relationships. Even if there was provocation, using a closed fist to hit someone's face is a clear act of physical aggression. The husband's yelling and mocking might have been inappropriate, but that doesn't justify a physical response. The user later admits in an edit that she realizes she was wrong, which suggests she acknowledges her mistake. However, the initial question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, most ethical and legal standards consider physical violence as wrong, regardless of the reason. Even in self-defense, the force used should be proportionate. Here, the situation doesn't indicate self-defense; it's more about an emotional reaction. The husband's behavior was also inappropriate (yelling, mocking, name-calling), but that doesn't make the punch acceptable. Both might have acted inappropriately, but the question is about the author's actions specifically.\n\nThe user's edit shows she's willing to apologize and take responsibility, which is a positive step. But the act itself\u2014hitting someone\u2014is generally considered wrong. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because she used physical violence. While the argument is a mutual issue, the question isn't about who's more at fault but whether she's wrong for her action. The husband's response of driving off and calling her a name is also problematic, but that's not the focus here. The key point is the act of hitting, which is a clear violation of non-violence in a relationship.\n"
