It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation involves a political disagreement between a Republican and a Democrat, which escalated into yelling and mocking. The wife then hit her husband with a closed fist, leading to a bruise. He left after calling her a name. She later realizes she was wrong and plans to apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. Physical violence in a relationship is generally considered wrong, regardless of provocation. Even if the husband was yelling and mocking, hitting him is a violent act that caused injury. The fact that she acknowledges her mistake and wants to apologize shows some self-awareness, but the action itself is problematic.\n\nThe husband's behavior (yelling and mocking) is also not acceptable, but that doesn't justify the wife's response. The question is whether she's in the wrong. In most ethical frameworks, using physical force in a conflict, even when provoked, is typically seen as the wrong action. It's important to note that mutual respect and non-violence are key in healthy relationships. \n\nThe edit mentions she's realizing her mistake and plans to apologize, which is a good step, but the initial act still stands as wrong. The troll account edit is probably a distraction, but the main issue is her response. The answer is likely A (she's in the wrong) because physical aggression isn't justified here, even if the argument was heated. The husband's behavior was bad too, but the question is about her actions specifically.\n"
