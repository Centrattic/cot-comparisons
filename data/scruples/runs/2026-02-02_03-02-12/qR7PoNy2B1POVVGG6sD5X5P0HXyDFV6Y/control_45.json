It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting her husband. The situation is a political argument between a Republican husband and a Democrat wife about abortion. They usually ignore their differences, but this time it escalated. The husband started yelling and mocking her, and in a fit of rage, she hit him with a closed fist to the face. He left, came back with a bruise, called her a bitch, and drove off. Now she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Physically assaulting someone, even in an argument, is generally considered wrong. Hitting someone with a closed fist can be classified as assault, which is illegal in many places. Even if there was provocation, the use of physical violence crosses a line. The husband's yelling and mocking might be inconsiderate, but that doesn't justify a punch. \n\nAlso, the context of their relationship is important. They usually avoid political arguments, so this was a big deal. Emotional reactions can escalate quickly, but the key point is whether using physical force was appropriate. The wife later realizes she was wrong and plans to apologize, which shows she acknowledges the mistake. The husband's response (calling her a name and leaving) might indicate he handled it poorly too, but that doesn't excuse her actions.\n\nThe edits mention a troll account and a realization of her wrongdoing. The final edit has an offensive term, which might be a red flag, but the main issue is the punch. In most cases, using physical violence in a relationship is not acceptable, regardless of the situation. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
