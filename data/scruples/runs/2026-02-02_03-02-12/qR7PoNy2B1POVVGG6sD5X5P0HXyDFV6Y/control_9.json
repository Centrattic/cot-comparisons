It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe user is asking if they're the asshole for hitting their husband. They had a political argument about abortion, which escalated. The husband started yelling and mocking her, and in a fit of rage, she hit him with a closed fist. Now he's left, and she's wondering if she was wrong. She also edited the post to say she realizes it was wrong and plans to apologize, and that it was a first-time incident. There's also an edit mentioning a troll account, but she clarifies it's not her.\n\nFirst, the key points here are that she physically hit her husband during an argument. Even if the husband was being aggressive, using physical violence is generally considered wrong. Assault is illegal in many places, and hitting someone, even in anger, is a form of domestic violence. The fact that she acknowledges it was wrong in her edit is important, but the action itself is still problematic. \n\nThe husband's behavior\u2014yelling and mocking\u2014might have contributed to the escalation, but that doesn't justify a physical response. People often make mistakes in heated arguments, but using physical force crosses a line. The fact that there was a bruise and he left suggests serious consequences.\n\nShe mentions that it's the first time, but even first-time incidents can be significant. The question is whether she's in the wrong. Since hitting someone is generally wrong regardless of provocation, the answer is likely A. However, some might argue that in the heat of the moment, emotions can lead to mistakes. But the legal and ethical standpoint usually holds that violence is not acceptable. The fact that she plans to apologize shows remorse, but that doesn't negate the initial wrongdoing. \n\nAlso, the edit about a troll account might be a red herring, but since she clarified it's not her, it's probably not relevant to the main issue. The \"GAMERS RISE UP\" edit seems like a joke and not part of the main scenario.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is in the wrong for using physical violence, even if provoked. So the answer should be A.\n"
