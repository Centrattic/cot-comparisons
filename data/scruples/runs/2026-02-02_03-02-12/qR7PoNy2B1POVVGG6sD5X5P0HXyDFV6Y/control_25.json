It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the person wrote about hitting their husband during an argument about politics. They mention that their husband was yelling and mocking them, which led to them hitting him in a fit of rage. The husband then left and they haven't seen him since. The user is asking if they're the asshole for punching him or if the husband is just being a baby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The argument was political, and they usually avoid discussing their differences. This time, the husband started yelling and mocking. The author hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. In the edit, they acknowledge that they realize their actions were wrong and plan to apologize, saying it was a first-time incident and they want to make up.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Generally, using physical violence in an argument is not acceptable, regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was yelling and being disrespectful, hitting him is a violation of consent and can be considered assault. The fact that it was a \"fit of rage\" doesn't excuse it. The author took responsibility in the edit, which shows they understand the mistake, but that doesn't change the fact that the action was wrong.\n\nThe husband's response of calling a name and leaving might be his way of dealing with the situation, but that doesn't justify the physical violence. However, the initial act of hitting someone, even in anger, is typically seen as the wrong action. The author could have de-escalated the situation without using physical force.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because using physical violence, even in an argument, is not acceptable. However, there might be nuances like self-defense, but since the husband wasn't threatening immediate physical harm, it's not applicable here.\n"
