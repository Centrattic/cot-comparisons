It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple with political differences leading to an argument. The husband starts yelling and mocking, and the wife hits him. She later realizes it was wrong and plans to apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if her action of hitting him makes her the asshole. Physical violence in a domestic setting is usually a red flag. Even if provoked, using a closed fist to hit someone's face is a form of assault. The husband's behavior (yelling, mocking) might be offensive, but does that justify a physical response? \n\nIn many legal systems, self-defense requires that the force used is proportional to the threat. Since the husband wasn't using physical violence at the time, his words alone might not justify a punch. The wife's action escalated the situation, leading to him leaving. \n\nHowever, the edit mentions she's realizing her mistake and plans to apologize. But the initial act is still there. The question is about whether she's in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, even if the husband was being an asshole, hitting him isn't the right response. So the answer would be A, yes, she's in the wrong. \n\nAlso, the fact that there's a troll account complicating things might be a red herring. The main issue is the physical altercation. So, the answer is A.\n"
