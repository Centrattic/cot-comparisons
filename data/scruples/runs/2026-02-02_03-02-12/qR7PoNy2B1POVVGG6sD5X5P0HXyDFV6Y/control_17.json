It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation is that they had a political disagreement about abortion, he was Republican and she's a Democrat. He started yelling and mocking her, and in a rage, she hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. Then he left and she hasn't seen him since. She's asking if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Physical violence is generally not acceptable, regardless of the situation. Even if there's provocation, hitting someone is a criminal act and can be considered assault. The fact that there was an argument doesn't justify the physical response. The husband's behavior of yelling and mocking might be disrespectful, but that doesn't give her the right to hit him. \n\nIn many legal systems, assault is a crime, and using a closed fist to hit someone can lead to charges. Even if they reconcile later, the act itself is problematic. The edit where she says she realizes it was wrong and plans to apologize doesn't change the fact that the action was wrong. Apologizing is good, but it doesn't make the action right.\n\nThere's also the part about the troll account pretending to be her husband. That complicates things, but the main issue is her action. The final edit about \"GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\" includes a racial slur, which might be a red flag for trolling or insensitivity, but the user's main question is about her hitting her husband.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author used physical violence in a domestic dispute. Even if there was an argument, that's not an excuse. Therefore, she is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
