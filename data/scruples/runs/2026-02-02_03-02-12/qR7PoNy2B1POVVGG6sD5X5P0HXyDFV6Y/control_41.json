It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a political argument with their husband, which escalated into yelling and mocking. The author hit their husband with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. Then the husband left, and the author is wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, physical violence in a relationship is generally considered wrong. Even if there was provocation, hitting someone is a form of assault. The husband did yell and mock, which is disrespectful, but that doesn't justify hitting him. The author acknowledges their mistake in an edit, saying they'll apologize. But the act itself is a problem because it's physical aggression.\n\nThe husband's response was also not great\u2014he called the author a \"bitch\" and left, which is dismissive and hurtful. However, that doesn't excuse the author's actions. The key point here is that using physical violence, regardless of the reason, is typically seen as wrong in relationships. Emotional responses like anger can lead to such actions, but it's important to address conflicts without resorting to physical harm.\n\nThe author's edit also shows some self-awareness, which is positive. But the initial question is about being in the wrong. So even if both parties had faults, the act of hitting someone is a clear violation. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
