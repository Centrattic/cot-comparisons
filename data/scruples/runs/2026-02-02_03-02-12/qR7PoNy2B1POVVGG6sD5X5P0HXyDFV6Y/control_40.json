It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is that she and her husband had a political argument, he was being yelling and mocking, and she hit him. Now she's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, the basics: physical violence is a big deal. Even if the husband was being rude, hitting him was an act of physical aggression. So from a legal standpoint, using a closed fist to hit someone's face would likely be considered assault. But the question is about right and wrong, not just legality.\n\nThen, context. She mentions they usually ignore political differences, but this argument was big. He started yelling and mocking her. She was in a rage and hit him. Afterward, he left and she hasn't seen him. She's asking if she's the asshole or if he's being a baby.\n\nIn terms of moral wrongs, even if provoked, using physical violence is generally considered wrong. It's not an appropriate response to verbal arguments. She acknowledges her mistake in the edit, saying she'll apologize. That shows she realizes it was wrong. The husband's response of calling her a name and driving off is also not great, but that doesn't justify her hitting him.\n\nAlso, the edits at the end are a bit confusing. The troll account pretending to be her husband and the \"GAMERS RISE UP\" edit might just be adding drama or a distraction. The key points are her admission of wrongdoing in the second edit. So the main issue is her physical aggression, which is a clear wrong action.\n\nSo the answer is A, yes, the author is in the wrong for hitting her husband, even if provoked. Physical violence isn't the right response.\n"
