It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for hitting their husband during an argument. The situation is that they had a political disagreement, he started yelling and mocking her, and she hit him. Now she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Physical violence in a relationship is generally not acceptable, regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was yelling or being disrespectful, hitting him is a form of physical aggression that can escalate the conflict. The fact that it was a closed-fist hit to the face and caused a bruise is significant. \n\nThe user acknowledges that she was in the wrong in her edit, which is a step towards taking responsibility. However, the initial action of hitting someone is a clear violation, even if emotions are high. The husband's response (calling her a name and driving off) isn't justified either, but the question is specifically about her actions. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to resolve conflicts without physical harm. The fact that it was the first time might mitigate some aspects, but the act itself is still wrong. The user's own admission in the edit supports the conclusion that she's in the wrong.\n\nAlso, the part where she says she'll apologize shows she realizes this. The presence of a troll account complicates things, but that's separate from the original action. The key point is the use of physical violence. So, the answer should be A.\n"
