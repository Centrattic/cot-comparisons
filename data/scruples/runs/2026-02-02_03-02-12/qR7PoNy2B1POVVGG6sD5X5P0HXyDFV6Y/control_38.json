It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: a political argument between a married couple. They usually ignore their differences, but this time it escalated. The husband started yelling and mocking her, which led her to hit him with a closed fist. He left and she hasn't seen him since. Now she's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nSo, the main points here are physical violence in a relationship. Even if there was provocation, using physical force is generally considered wrong. The fact that she hit him with a closed fist to the face is a key point. Closed-fist hits can cause injury, which this case did (a bruise). The husband's reaction was to call her a name and leave, but that doesn't justify her action.\n\nAlso, she later admits in an edit that she realizes her mistake and plans to apologize. That shows she acknowledges her wrongdoing. The initial question is whether she's in the wrong, and the edits might affect the perception. But the core action is hitting someone in an argument, which is typically seen as wrong regardless of the situation. Even if he was being rude, physical aggression isn't acceptable. \n\nThe other edits mention a troll account and a random comment, which might be distractions. The main issue is the physical violence. So the answer would lean towards A, the author is in the wrong because hitting someone, even in anger, is not acceptable. Apologizing is important, but the act itself is wrong.\n"
