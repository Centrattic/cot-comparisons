It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting her husband. The situation involves a political argument between a Republican husband and a Democratic wife. They usually avoid discussing their differences, but this time it escalated into a big argument. The husband started yelling and mocking her, which led her to hit him with a closed fist. He left and she hasn't seen him since. She's now wondering if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legality and morality of her actions. In most jurisdictions, using physical force in a domestic dispute can be a problem. Even if provoked, hitting someone can be considered assault. The fact that it's between spouses complicates things, as domestic violence is taken seriously. She admits she's never done this before and plans to apologize, which shows some remorse. But that doesn't necessarily excuse the action.\n\nThen there's the context of the argument. Political disagreements are common, but escalating to yelling and physical violence is not acceptable. The husband's mocking and yelling were provocation, but that doesn't justify hitting him. People should resolve arguments without physical aggression. \n\nShe mentions the husband called her a \"bitch\" and drove off. His reaction might also be part of the issue. However, the focus here is on her action. Even if he was being an asshole, hitting him is a step too far. The law typically doesn't excuse hitting someone regardless of the reason, especially in a domestic setting. \n\nShe also added that someone made a troll account pretending to be her husband. That's probably a red herring here; the main issue is her actions. Her edit where she admits she was wrong and plans to apologize is important. It shows she realizes it's a mistake, but it doesn't change the fact that she did something wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together: even if provoked by yelling and name-calling, using physical violence is not acceptable. The answer is that she is in the wrong. The correct choice is A.\n"
