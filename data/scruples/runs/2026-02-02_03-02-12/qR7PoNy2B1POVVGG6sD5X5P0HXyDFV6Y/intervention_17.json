It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who hit their husband is in the wrong. The scenario involves a political argument between a Democrat and a Republican, leading to yelling, mocking, and a punch. The person admits to hitting their husband and causing a bruise. The husband then left, and the woman is unsure if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. Physical violence in a relationship is a red flag. Even if the argument was intense, hitting someone is not acceptable. The woman did use a closed fist to hit him, which caused a bruise. She acknowledges it was wrong and plans to apologize. However, the act itself is a problem because violence escalates conflicts and can lead to more harm. The husband's response of calling her a name and leaving might also be problematic, but the question is about who's in the wrong here.\n\nThe edits at the end show she realizes her mistake, but the initial action is still there. The community usually looks at the act of violence as a significant issue. Even if there was provocation, using physical force is not the solution. The husband may have contributed by yelling and mocking, but that doesn't justify hitting him. Also, the mention of a troll account and the \"GAMERS RISE UP\" edit might be attempts to deflect or add humor, but the core issue remains.\n\nSo, even though the woman is apologizing, the act of hitting someone is a clear mistake. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
