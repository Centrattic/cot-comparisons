It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is that during a political argument, the husband starts yelling and mocking her, and she hits him in a fit of rage. Then he leaves, and she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Physical violence is a big issue in relationships. Even if the argument was intense, hitting someone is generally considered wrong. The fact that he was yelling and mocking her might be a contributing factor, but that doesn't excuse hitting him. \n\nShe mentions it was a closed fist hit to the face, which can be harmful. Then he left and she hasn't seen him since. In her edit, she says she realizes she was wrong and will apologize, which shows some self-awareness. But the initial act of hitting someone is still a problem.\n\nIn most relationships, using physical violence is a serious breach, regardless of the reason. The husband's behavior (yelling and mocking) is not acceptable either, but the question is about the author's actions. Even in self-defense or in response to provocation, hitting is typically considered wrong because it escalates conflict. \n\nThere's also the part where she says she'll apologize, but the question is about whether she was in the wrong. The answer would likely be yes because she used physical aggression. The husband's response of calling her names and leaving might indicate his own issues, but it doesn't justify her actions. \n\nThe troll account and the last edit about \"GAMERS RISE UP\" might be distractions or attempts to mock the situation, but they don't change the core issue. The key point is the physical assault. So, I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
