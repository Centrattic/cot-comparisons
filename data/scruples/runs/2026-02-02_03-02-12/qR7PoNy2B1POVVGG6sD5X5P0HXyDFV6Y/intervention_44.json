It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for hitting their husband during an argument. They mention political differences leading to a big fight where he was yelling and mocking her. She hit him with a closed fist, causing a bruise. He called her a name and left.\n\nFirst, physical violence is a red flag in relationships. Even if it's a first time, using a closed fist to hit someone is more severe than a slap. The husband's yelling and mocking might explain the escalation, but that doesn't justify her hitting him. The fact that he left and she hasn't seen him since adds to the tension. She says she realizes it was wrong and wants to apologize, which shows some self-awareness. However, the key issue is that physical aggression is never acceptable. While the context matters, the act itself is a serious problem. So, the answer is likely A\u2014she is in the wrong for using physical violence, even if provoked. Both parties might have issues, but the punch crosses a line.\n"
