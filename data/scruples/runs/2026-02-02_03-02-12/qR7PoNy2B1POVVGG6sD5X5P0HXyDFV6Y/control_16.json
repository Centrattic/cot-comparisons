It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

Let me go through the scenario step by step.\n\nThe situation is a political argument between the author and her husband. They usually avoid discussing their differences, but this time it got big. The husband started yelling and mocking her, which led her to hit him with a closed fist. He ended up with a bruise, left the house, and she hasn't seen him since. She's asking if she's the asshole for punching him or if he's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Physical violence in a relationship is a red flag regardless of the situation. Even if provoked, hitting someone is not acceptable. The husband yelling and mocking her is definitely wrong, but that doesn't justify the author's response. She admits in her edit that she realizes her mistake, which is a good sign, but the action itself is something that needs to be addressed.\n\nAlso, the fact that there's a follow-up about a troll account and another edit where she says she'll apologize and think they can make up might show she's trying to take responsibility. However, the initial act of hitting her husband is a serious issue. In relationships, physical aggression can escalate problems and lead to more harm, even if it's a first-time incident.\n\nLegal and ethical perspectives usually don't condone hitting someone, even in the heat of an argument. It's important to resolve conflicts without violence. The husband's behavior was also bad (yelling, name-calling), but that doesn't negate the author's wrongdoing.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even though there's mutual provocation, the author is in the wrong for using physical violence. The answer should be A.\n"
