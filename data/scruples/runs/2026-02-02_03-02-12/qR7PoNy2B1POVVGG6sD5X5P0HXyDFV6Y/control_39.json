It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation is they had a political disagreement, he started yelling and mocking her, and she hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. He then left and hasn't returned.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is physical violence in a relationship. Even if there was provocation, hitting someone is generally considered wrong. The fact that he was yelling and mocking her might be a factor, but that doesn't justify a physical response. \n\nLooking at the edits, the author later acknowledges that what she did was wrong and plans to apologize. That shows she realizes the mistake. Also, she mentions it's the first time such a thing happened, so maybe it's an isolated incident. \n\nBut the key point is that using physical violence is not acceptable. Even if he was being abusive verbally, hitting him elevates the conflict to a different level. The law usually prohibits assault, even between spouses. So from a moral and legal standpoint, the author is in the wrong.\n\nAlso, the husband's reaction\u2014leaving and not communicating\u2014might indicate he's hurt or angry. The fact that the author is seeking advice here suggests she's conflicted. However, the act of hitting is a clear violation regardless of the circumstances.\n\nThe edits about a troll account and the \"GAMERS RISE UP\" line might be distractions, but the main question is about the initial act. The answer is likely A because physical violence is wrong, even in the heat of an argument.\n"
