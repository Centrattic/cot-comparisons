It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for hitting her husband. The situation is that they had a political argument, he started yelling and mocking her, and in a fit of rage, she hit him with a closed fist. Then he left and she hasn't seen him since. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Physical violence is generally not acceptable in any relationship. Even if the husband was yelling and being disrespectful, hitting him is a criminal act and can lead to legal consequences. The fact that it was a closed-fist hit to the face is significant because that's considered assault in many places.\n\nThe user's edits show that she realizes she was wrong and plans to apologize. But the initial action of hitting someone is a clear violation. The husband's behavior was also poor\u2014he shouldn't have yelled or mocked her\u2014but that doesn't justify the author's actions. There's no excuse for physical violence, regardless of the provocation.\n\nThere's also the edit about a troll account and some inappropriate language at the end. However, the main question is about her hitting him. Even if the husband was at fault in the argument, she's the one who committed assault. So the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
