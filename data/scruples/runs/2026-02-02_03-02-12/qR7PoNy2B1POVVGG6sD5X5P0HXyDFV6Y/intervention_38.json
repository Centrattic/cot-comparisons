It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The story says they had a political disagreement about abortion, which escalated. He started yelling and mocking her, and in a rage, she hit him with a closed fist to the face. He left and she hasn't seen him since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Physical violence in a relationship is generally a serious issue. Even if provoked, hitting someone is not acceptable. The husband's behavior of yelling and mocking contributed to the escalation, but that doesn't justify the response. The key here is whether the author's action is excusable given the circumstances. \n\nIn many cultures and legal systems, using physical force in response to verbal aggression might not be considered justified. While self-defense could be a consideration, the scenario doesn't indicate that she was in immediate danger. The hit caused a bruise, so there's physical harm involved. \n\nThe author also edited the post to say she realizes she was wrong and plans to apologize. That shows she recognizes the mistake, but the question is about whether she was in the wrong in the first place. \n\nThe husband's actions (mocking, yelling) were poor, but physical violence is a step that's not acceptable regardless of provocation. So, the answer is likely A (she is in the wrong). However, there's a nuance here because the husband's behavior was also problematic. But the line is crossed when it turns physical. The author's edit shows she acknowledges this, but the initial action was still wrong. \n\nAlso, the final edit about \"GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\" seems out of context and possibly a typo or intentional. It might indicate a lack of seriousness, but that's probably not relevant to the main issue. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is A.\n"
