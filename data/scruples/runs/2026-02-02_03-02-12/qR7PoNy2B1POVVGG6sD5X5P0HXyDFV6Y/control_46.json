It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation involves a political disagreement, with the husband yelling and mocking her, leading to her hitting him. Then he left, and she's wondering if she was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The argument started over politics, which they usually ignore. This time it escalated. The husband was yelling and mocking her, which could be considered abusive behavior. In response, the author hit him with a closed fist to the face, causing a bruise. After that, the husband left, called her a name, and disappeared.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether using physical violence was justified. Even if provoked, hitting someone is generally considered wrong. The husband's yelling and mocking might be inconsiderate, but physical assault is a criminal act and crosses a line. The author admitted in the edit that she realizes it was wrong, which shows self-awareness. However, the fact remains that she used violence. \n\nThere's also the part where the husband left and called her a \"bitch,\" which might be part of the conflict, but that doesn't justify her actions. In most legal systems, mutual combat doesn't make it okay; both parties are at fault in different ways. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she was the one to initiate the physical violence, even if provoked, she's likely in the wrong. The husband's behavior was inconsiderate, but that doesn't excuse her hitting him. \n\nAlso, the edit mentions she plans to apologize, which is good, but the initial action is still a problem. The troll account part might be a distraction, but the main issue is the physical altercation. So, the answer is A (Yes, she's in the wrong) because using physical violence is not acceptable, regardless of the provocation.\n"
