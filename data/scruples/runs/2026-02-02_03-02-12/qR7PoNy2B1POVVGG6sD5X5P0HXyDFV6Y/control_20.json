It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for hitting her husband. The situation involves a political argument, yelling, mocking, and then a physical altercation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple usually avoids political discussions, but this argument escalated. The husband started yelling and mocking her, which led her to hit him with a closed fist. He left, and now she's reflecting on whether she was wrong.\n\nLegally, in most places, using physical force even in response to verbal aggression can be considered assault. Mutual combat might be a factor if both parties used force, but the initial aggressor is usually the one who starts the physical fight. Here, the husband's yelling and mocking might be the provocation, but hitting someone in response is still a criminal act in many jurisdictions. However, some places have self-defense laws, but that typically requires immediate threat of harm, which yelling and mocking might not constitute. \n\nEmotionally, the author acknowledges her mistake in an edit and plans to apologize, which suggests she realizes it was wrong. The husband's reaction (leaving and not returning) could indicate he's hurt or angry. The question is whether her action was justified. Even if provoked, hitting someone is generally not acceptable. However, the context of the argument and the provocation might be considered.\n\nThe edits also show she's taking responsibility now, but the initial act remains. The community's typical \"AITA\" responses often focus on whether the action was a clear violation of norms. Hitting someone, even in anger, is usually seen as wrong, regardless of provocation. So the answer is likely A (yes, she's in the wrong). But I should check if there's any nuance I'm missing, like if there was a history of abuse or if the husband's actions were more severe. The post doesn't mention prior abuse, just this incident. The husband's yelling and mocking, while hurtful, might not be enough to justify hitting. So the answer is A.\n"
