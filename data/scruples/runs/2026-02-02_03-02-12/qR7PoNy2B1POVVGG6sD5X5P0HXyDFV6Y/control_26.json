It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a woman, got into a political argument with her Republican husband. They usually avoid discussing their differing views on abortion, but this time it escalated. He started yelling and mocking her, and in a fit of rage, she hit him with a closed fist. He left, and she later saw a bruise. Now she's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if her action of hitting him is considered wrong. The key points here are the use of physical violence. Even if the husband was yelling and being disrespectful, using a closed fist to hit someone's face is a form of assault. In most societies, hitting another person, even in anger, is not excusable. It's a physical aggression that can cause harm. So the author's action is a clear case of physical violence. \n\nThe husband's behavior\u2014yelling and mocking\u2014might be inconsiderate and contribute to the tension, but that doesn't justify the wife hitting him. While it's important to address how the husband behaved, the wife's response crosses a line into physical abuse. The fact that this was a first-time incident doesn't negate the action's wrongness. \n\nThe author's follow-up edit says she realizes she was wrong and will apologize. That shows some self-awareness, but the question is whether she was in the wrong initially. The answer is still yes. The husband's behavior, while inconsiderate, doesn't justify a physical response. So the answer should be A, the author is in the wrong. The part about the troll account and the edit about \"GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\" seems like an edit in the original post but doesn't affect the analysis here.\n"
