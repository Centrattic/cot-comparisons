It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation involves political differences leading to a heated argument, with the husband yelling and mocking her, and then the author hitting him with a closed fist. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know the correct answer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. Physical violence in a relationship is a major issue. Even if provoked, hitting someone is a form of assault. The husband did yell and mock her, which might be considered emotional abuse, but that doesn't justify physical retaliation. The author acknowledges that she was wrong in her edit, which shows some self-awareness. However, the question is whether she is in the wrong.\n\nIn many contexts, using physical force, even in response to verbal abuse, can be seen as inappropriate because it escalates the conflict and can lead to further harm. The fact that there was a small bruise indicates that there was some physical injury. The husband's reaction of calling her a name and driving off might suggest he's also handling the situation poorly, but that doesn't excuse her actions.\n\nAlso, the author's final edit about \"GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\" seems out of place and possibly a joke or a troll, which might indicate some immaturity in how the situation is being handled, but that's separate from the main issue.\n\nConsidering all that, even if the husband was at fault for yelling and mocking, the author's response of hitting him is not acceptable. Therefore, the answer would be that she is in the wrong.\n"
