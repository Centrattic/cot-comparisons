It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for hitting her husband. The scenario is that they had a political argument, he was yelling and mocking her, and she hit him in a fit of rage, resulting in a small bruise. He then left and she hasn't seen him since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most places, hitting someone even in an argument can be considered assault. However, self-defense might be a factor if she felt immediate harm. But since he was mocking and yelling, it's not clear if he was physically threatening her. So legally, it's possible she could be in trouble for assault.\n\nEthically, even if there was provocation, using physical violence is generally frowned upon. It's important to handle conflicts without resorting to hitting. The fact that she later realizes she was wrong and wants to apologize shows some self-awareness, but the action itself is still wrong.\n\nAlso, the edits mention she acknowledges her mistake, which is a positive, but the initial action of hitting him is the issue. The fact that he left and called her a name adds to the tension, but doesn't justify her hitting him. Both sides have issues here, but the question is specifically about her.\n\nSo considering all that, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because using physical violence, even in anger, is not acceptable and can be considered assault. The fact that she later realizes this supports that she was wrong.\n"
