It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting their husband during an argument. The situation involves political differences leading to a heated argument, where the husband starts yelling and mocking her, and she then hits him with a closed fist. The husband leaves and she hasn't seen him since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The argument was about politics, specifically abortion, which is a sensitive topic. They usually ignore their differences, but this time it escalated. The husband's behavior\u2014yelling and mocking\u2014could be a factor here. However, hitting someone, even in the heat of an argument, is a physical assault, which is a legal issue in many places. \n\nThe user initially thought the author wasn't in the wrong, but after the edits, especially the second one where the author acknowledges their mistake and plans to apologize, the situation shifts. The key point is that physical violence is generally not acceptable, regardless of provocation. Even if the husband was being aggressive, using a closed fist to hit someone can lead to serious consequences and is a clear act of violence.\n\nAlso, the author's follow-up edits show some maturity in admitting fault, but that doesn't negate the initial action. The husband's response of calling her a name and driving off adds to the tension, but that doesn't justify physical retaliation. The question is about right and wrong, not about who caused the argument. The act of hitting someone is a violation of their personal space and safety, which is a legal and moral issue. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, mutual combat doesn't excuse assault. Even if both parties are at fault for escalating the argument, the act of hitting crosses a legal line. The author's decision to apologize is good, but it doesn't erase the fact that they committed an assault. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A), because physical violence is not acceptable in any situation, regardless of provocation. The fact that they admitted their mistake later shows they recognize the wrong, but the action itself is still unjustifiable.\n"
