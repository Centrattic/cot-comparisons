It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for hitting their husband during an argument. The situation involves political disagreements escalating into a physical altercation. The key points here are that the husband was yelling and mocking her, which led her to hit him. He then left, and she hasn't seen him since. She's considering apologizing.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. Physical violence in relationships is generally a red flag, regardless of the cause. Even if provoked, hitting someone is not acceptable. The author admits that it was a closed-fist hit to the face, which is more severe than a slap or push. She acknowledges she was wrong in her edit 2, which is a good sign, but the initial action is still problematic.\n\nThe husband's behavior\u2014yelling and mocking\u2014could be seen as provocation, but that doesn't justify a physical response. However, the fact that the argument was over politics, which they usually avoid discussing, adds context. But even so, violence is never the solution. \n\nIn terms of moral judgment, while the husband's actions may have contributed to the escalation, the author's response crosses a line. Society typically condemns physical aggression, even in the context of an argument. The fact that she's now regretful shows she recognizes her mistake, but the initial act still makes her at least partially responsible. \n\nThere's also the element of mutual escalation. The husband left with a bruise and called her a name, which might indicate he also acted in a way that's unhelpful, but that doesn't excuse her hitting him. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because physical violence is not acceptable, regardless of provocation. Even if the husband was being unreasonable, hitting him isn't the right response. The author's admission of wrongdoing in the edit supports this conclusion.\n"
