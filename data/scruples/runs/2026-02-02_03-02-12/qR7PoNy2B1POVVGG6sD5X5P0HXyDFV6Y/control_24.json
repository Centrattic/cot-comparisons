It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting their husband. The situation is that they had a political argument, the husband started yelling and mocking her, and in her rage, she hit him. Now, she's questioning if she was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She mentions they usually ignore political differences, but this time it escalated. He was yelling and mocking her, which could be seen as provocation. But physical violence is a big issue regardless of context. Even if provoked, hitting someone is a criminal act in most places. So, legally, she's probably in the wrong. \n\nHowever, some might argue that he initiated the conflict by yelling and mocking. But the key point here is that using physical violence to resolve an argument is never acceptable, no matter the provocation. She later apologized in her edit, acknowledging her mistake, which shows she knows it was wrong.\n\nAlso, the husband left and called her a name, but that doesn't justify her hitting him. The question is about whether she's in the wrong. The answer is likely yes because physical assault is a serious matter. Even if both parties contributed to the argument, the act of hitting is on her. So the answer should be A.\n"
