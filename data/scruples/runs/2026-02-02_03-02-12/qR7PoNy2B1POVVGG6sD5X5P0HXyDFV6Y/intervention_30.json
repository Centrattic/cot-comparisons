It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The scenario involves a political disagreement between a Republican husband and a Democratic wife, leading to an argument where he yells and mocks her, and she hits him with a closed fist. She acknowledges that she might be wrong and plans to apologize. There are also edits where she clarifies that a troll is pretending to be her husband and that she realizes her mistake.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the core issue: physical violence in a relationship. Even if the husband was being disrespectful (yelling and mocking), using physical violence is generally not acceptable. The wife's action of hitting him was a closed fist to the face, which is a clear act of aggression. The husband then left, and she hasn't seen him since. \n\nThe user initially thought the author isn't in the wrong, but after considering that hitting is a form of violence, it's more likely that she is in the wrong. However, the husband's behavior (yelling and mocking) might have contributed. But in most cases, physical violence escalates conflict and is not an appropriate response, regardless of provocation. The author later admits she was wrong, which suggests she recognizes her mistake. \n\nThe edits add context about a troll and her intention to apologize, which shows she's trying to address the situation. However, the initial act of hitting someone is a serious issue. Even in heated arguments, using physical force is a problem. So, the answer would be that she is in the wrong (A). The key points are that physical violence is not justified, even if provoked, and that the author acknowledges her mistake later, but the act itself is wrong.\n"
