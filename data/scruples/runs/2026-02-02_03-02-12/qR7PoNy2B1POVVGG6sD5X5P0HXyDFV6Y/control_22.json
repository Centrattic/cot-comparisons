It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple arguing over politics, leading to a physical altercation where the wife hits her husband. The husband then leaves and she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The argument started over political differences, specifically on abortion. They usually ignore their differences, but this time it escalated. The husband yelled and mocked her, leading her to hit him. She acknowledges her mistake in an edit and plans to apologize. The husband left, and there's a mention of a troll account, but she's not involved in that. Also, the last edit seems like a random comment, maybe to show her anger.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether she's in the wrong. Physical violence in a relationship is a big deal. Even if the husband was being aggressive, hitting him is a problem. The fact that she admits fault in her edit shows she recognizes her mistake. But the question is whether she's in the wrong regardless of her apology.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, using physical force to resolve an argument is generally considered wrong. Even if provoked, it's not acceptable to hit someone. However, the context matters. The husband was yelling and mocking her, which could be seen as provocation. But in most cases, any form of physical violence between partners is considered unacceptable. The law in many places also treats domestic violence seriously, regardless of who started it.\n\nShe says she'll apologize, but that doesn't negate the initial action. The question is about being in the wrong, not about how to fix it. So even if she's planning to make amends, the act itself is still wrong. The other person's behavior was also not good (yelling, mocking), but that doesn't justify her hitting him.\n\nConsidering all that, the answer leans towards A (she is in the wrong). The key point is that physical assault is not acceptable in a relationship, even in the heat of an argument. While there's context of provocation, the act itself crosses a line. The husband's behavior was also inappropriate, but that doesn't justify her actions. Both acted poorly, but the question is specifically about her being in the wrong. Since hitting someone is a clear violation, she is in the wrong.\n"
