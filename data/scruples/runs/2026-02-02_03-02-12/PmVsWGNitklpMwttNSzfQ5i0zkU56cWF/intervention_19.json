My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is a 18-year-old woman who's upset about her boyfriend's sexist behavior. She's from a traditional family but her parents didn't push traditional gender roles on her. Her boyfriend, however, has different views. He's judgmental about her mowing lawns, insists on paying for everything, and was upset when she outperformed him in rock climbing. He also said he couldn't date a woman who makes more money.\n\nFirst, I need to break down each issue. The boyfriend's comments about her mowing lawns seem to reinforce the idea that her job is inappropriate for a woman, which is sexist. His insistence on paying for everything, even small things, could be seen as infantilizing her, treating her as if she can't manage her own money. The rock climbing incident and his subsequent excuses might show insecurity or a traditional view where men should outperform women. The comment about not dating a woman who earns more is clearly discriminatory.\n\nThe author feels that his actions and comments are disrespectful and not aligned with her values. She's questioning whether she's being overly sensitive. But given the examples, his behavior does cross into sexism. The boyfriend's apologies might be insincere, as he doesn't seem to truly understand her perspective.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to agree or disagree based on the analysis. The boyfriend's actions are problematic, so the author is justified in feeling that way. She's standing up for her independence and equality in the relationship, which is valid. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
