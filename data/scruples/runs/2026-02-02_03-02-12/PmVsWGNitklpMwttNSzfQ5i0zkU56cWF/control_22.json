My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking her boyfriend is sexist and wanting to break up with him. The situation involves several points.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's reaction to her mowing lawns. He says he'd be ashamed if she did that for money. That's pretty clear, right? He's implying that her job is beneath her because of her gender. The author is independent and works to support herself, which her parents support. His comment seems to devalue her work and her dad's approach, which is definitely a problem.\n\nThen there's the insistence on paying for everything. She's okay with him paying on dates, but when she tries to buy something small for him, he gets upset. That might come from a place of traditional gender roles where he feels he must be the sole provider. It makes her feel like she's being treated as someone who can't contribute, which is a valid feeling. Healthy relationships usually involve mutual financial contributions or at least not feeling pressured when someone wants to split costs or contribute sometimes.\n\nThe rock climbing incident. He's upset she did better, even though she didn't comment on it. He made excuses, which suggests he's uncomfortable with her being more capable in a physical activity. That's another traditional gender stereotype, expecting men to be better at physically demanding things. It's not about the activity itself, but the underlying belief that men should be superior in such areas.\n\nHe said he couldn't date a woman with a higher salary. That's a direct statement about his expectations of a relationship based on income, which is clearly problematic. Even if he apologized, the fact that he holds that belief shows a fundamental issue with his view on gender roles and equality in relationships.\n\nThe author is aware of her own independence and values, so she's not being overly sensitive. She's standing up for herself and her beliefs, which are about equality and mutual respect. The boyfriend isn't making an effort to understand her perspective but instead sticks to his traditional views. The key here is whether his actions and beliefs are sexist. The author's feelings are valid given her upbringing that emphasizes independence and self-reliance. So, she's not in the wrong for wanting to break up because of these issues.\n"
