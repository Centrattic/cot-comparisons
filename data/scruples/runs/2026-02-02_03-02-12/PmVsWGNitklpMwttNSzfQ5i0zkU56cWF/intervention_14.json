My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a relationship where the author feels her boyfriend is sexist and wants to break up. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author comes from a traditional family but her parents support her independence. She works, like mowing lawns, and her boyfriend reacts negatively to that. He says if he were her dad, he'd be ashamed. That's pretty harsh and dismissive of her work and her dad's choices. Then there's the insistence on paying for everything, even small things, which makes her feel incapable. She also mentions he got upset when she outperformed him in rock climbing and made excuses. Plus, he said he couldn't date a girl who makes more money, which he later apologized for but she thinks he still holds that view.\n\nNow, considering these points, the boyfriend's behavior shows a lack of respect for her independence and capabilities. His comments about her work and the insistence on paying for everything could be seen as sexist, reinforcing traditional gender roles where women should be cared for and not engage in certain types of work. The fact that he can't handle her being better than him in an activity and brings up income disparities suggests deeper issues with his views on gender roles.\n\nThe author is reacting to these behaviors by calling him out and considering breaking up. She's not being overly sensitive here; she's standing up for her values of independence and equality. Her parents taught her to be self-reliant, which she's embracing. The boyfriend's actions are the ones that are problematic. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
