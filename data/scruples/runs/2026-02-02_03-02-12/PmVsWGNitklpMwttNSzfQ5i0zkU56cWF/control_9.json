My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The person is a woman in a relationship where she feels her boyfriend is sexist. He made comments about her mowing lawns, insists on paying for everything, and said he can't date a woman who earns more than him. She wants to break up because of these issues.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether her reaction is justified. The boyfriend's behavior includes making her feel ashamed for working, not allowing her to contribute financially, and having a comment about his salary being higher. These actions could be seen as sexist because they reinforce traditional gender roles where women are not expected to work certain jobs or earn more than men. The key here is whether these actions are indeed sexist and if the author is overreacting.\n\nHer parents raised her to be independent, which she appreciates. She values her own work and financial independence. The boyfriend's insistence on paying for everything might stem from his upbringing, but it's problematic because it undermines her autonomy. The comment about salary is clearly discriminatory. The author isn't just being sensitive; she's standing up for her values of equality and independence.\n\nThe boyfriend's apologies might be insincere, as he doesn't seem to understand her perspective. His actions consistently show a lack of respect for her independence. The author is right to feel uncomfortable and to want to end the relationship if these issues aren't resolved. There's no indication she's wrong here. Her stance on equality is valid, and it's important for both partners to respect each other's values.\n"
