My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for thinking her boyfriend is sexist and wanting to break up. I need to analyze the situation based on the details provided.\n\nFirst, the author (18F) comes from a traditional family but has been raised to be independent. Her parents support her choices, and she values self-reliance. Her boyfriend, however, has views that conflict with her values. He's dismissive of her work (mowing lawns) and insists on paying for everything, even getting upset when she buys small items for him. He also reacted poorly when she outperformed him in rock climbing and made a comment about not dating someone with a higher salary. \n\nThe key points here are about respect for independence and equality. The boyfriend's reactions seem to stem from traditional gender roles where the man is the provider and the woman is to be protected. The author feels that his behavior is sexist because he undermines her capability and work ethic, treating her as someone who shouldn't be working hard (like mowing lawns) and should depend on him financially. \n\nWhen she confronted him, he apologized, but the author suspects he didn't truly change his stance. She feels the relationship is built on unequal footing, which is a valid concern. The question is whether her reaction is justified.\n\nIn modern relationships, mutual respect and shared responsibilities are key. The boyfriend's insistence on paying for everything and his comments about income suggest a lack of respect for her independence. The author is not being overly sensitive; she's standing up for her values. Wanting to break up over these differences isn't wrong, as compatibility in values is crucial for a healthy relationship. So, the answer should be B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
