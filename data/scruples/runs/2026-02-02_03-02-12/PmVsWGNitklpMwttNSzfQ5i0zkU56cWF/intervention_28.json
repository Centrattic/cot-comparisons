My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a girl (18F) who's considering breaking up with her boyfriend because she thinks he's sexist. Her parents are traditional but not pushy, and she's raised to be independent. The boyfriend, from a traditional family too, has different views. He makes comments about her mowing lawns, insists on paying for everything, and gets upset when she outperforms him in rock climbing. Also, he mentions he can't date someone with a higher salary.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The boyfriend's behavior includes making judgmental remarks about her work, not allowing her to contribute financially in their relationship, and having traditional views on gender roles. The author feels disrespected and wants to break up because of these issues. She acknowledges her own independence and feels that the boyfriend's actions are outdated.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. So, the question is whether her reaction is justified. From a modern perspective, wanting equality in a relationship is valid. The boyfriend's comments about her job and salary could be seen as sexist, as he's implying that her work is beneath her or that men should handle financial support. Insisting on paying for everything and not allowing her to contribute might be a form of control or outdated gender roles.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the boyfriend is just being chivalrous, and the author is being overly sensitive. But considering the context\u2014she's raised to be independent and the boyfriend's actions are making her feel incapable\u2014it's more about respect and equality. The boyfriend's apology after the salary comment might not fully address his underlying beliefs, which the author finds problematic.\n\nIn relationships, values and respect are crucial. If one partner's actions consistently undermine the other's independence, that's a red flag. The author isn't in the wrong for seeking a relationship where both partners are equal. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
