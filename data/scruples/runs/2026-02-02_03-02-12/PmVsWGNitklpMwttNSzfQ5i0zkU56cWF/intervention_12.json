My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author (18F) is in a relationship with her boyfriend (bf), and she's considering breaking up because she thinks he's sexist. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author comes from a traditional family but her parents are supportive of her independence. They don't push traditional gender roles on her. She's self-sufficient, works part-time mowing lawns, and values her independence. Her boyfriend, on the other hand, has different views. He's critical of her mowing lawns, saying her dad would be ashamed, and insists on paying for everything. He also gets upset when she outperforms him in rock climbing and makes a comment about always making more money than her in the future.\n\nThe main issues here are his comments about her job, his insistence on paying for everything, his reaction to her outperforming him, and his statement about not dating someone with a higher salary. The author feels these behaviors are sexist because they reinforce traditional gender roles where women are to be taken care of and not as assertive or independent.\n\nNow, considering the boyfriend's perspective, he might see his actions as respectful and chivalrous. He's trying to be a gentleman by paying for dates, which is a common expectation in some cultures. However, the author views this as infantilizing, especially since she's not asking for financial support and values her independence. His comment about not dating a woman with a higher salary is problematic because it perpetuates the idea that men should be the higher earners, which is a form of sexism.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction to her mowing lawns (\"ashamed of his daughter\") is also sexist. It implies that certain jobs are beneath women and that their role is to be cared for rather than to work. His insistence on paying for everything could be seen as paternalistic, suggesting that she can't handle her own finances, which undermines her independence.\n\nThe author's decision to break up because of these issues is based on her values of gender equality and independence. She's not looking for a partner who imposes traditional roles on her. The boyfriend's behavior, while perhaps well-intentioned from his perspective, is based on outdated and sexist notions. The author isn't being overly sensitive; she's standing up for her belief in equality. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
