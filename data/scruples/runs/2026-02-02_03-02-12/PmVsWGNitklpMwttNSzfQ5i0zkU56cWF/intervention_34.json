My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girl (18F) who's breaking up with her boyfriend because he's sexist, according to her. She gives examples like him being ashamed if he were her dad about her mowing lawns, insisting on paying for everything, getting upset when she outperforms him in rock climbing, and saying he can't date a woman who makes more money than him.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the boyfriend's actions are indeed sexist. The boyfriend's comments about mowing lawns and being ashamed if he were her dad definitely come off as condescending and reinforcing traditional gender roles. Wanting to pay for everything might be a cultural thing, but when it crosses into not allowing her to buy small things for him and making her feel incapable, that's a problem. The rock climbing incident shows he's defensive and maybe feels threatened by her competence. His comment about always making more money is clearly sexist because it implies that a man should earn more than a woman, perpetuating outdated gender dynamics.\n\nThe author is standing up for her independence and rejecting these views. Her parents raised her to be self-sufficient, which aligns with her values. The boyfriend's behavior is inconsistent with her values of equality and independence. She's not being overly sensitive; she's recognizing his sexist attitudes and choosing to leave the relationship because they conflict with her beliefs. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and shared values are crucial. If one partner's actions consistently undermine the other's autonomy and beliefs, it's a valid reason to end the relationship. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling triggered by these behaviors; she's responding to real issues. The boyfriend's apologies might not address the root of the problem if he doesn't genuinely change his views. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's justified in her feelings and her decision to break up based on his sexist behaviors that clash with her values.\n"
