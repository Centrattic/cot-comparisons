My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a 18-year-old woman in a relationship with her boyfriend. She's concerned about his sexist views and wants to break up. Her parents are traditional but also support their daughters being independent. The boyfriend comes from a traditional family too, but his views differ. Let's break down the incidents mentioned.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend is upset that she mows lawns. He says if he were her dad, he'd be ashamed. The author feels this is an insult to her father and she likes mowing lawns because it's a workout and she likes being outside. Also, she sees this as her way of earning money for her own needs. The boyfriend's reaction here seems to imply that her job is beneath her, maybe because it's physical labor, which could be a sexist assumption about women's roles.\n\nThen there's the part about him insisting on paying for everything. While some people appreciate that gesture, she feels it's taken too far when he gets upset if she tries to buy him a snack. This might be about control or gender roles, where he expects her to be financially dependent. The fact that he throws a fit when she tries to contribute could make her feel undervalued and like she can't be his equal in the relationship.\n\nThe rock climbing incident and his reaction to being shown up. He makes excuses for his poor performance, and later mentions that he should always make more money than her. This statement is clearly sexist, suggesting that a man should out-earn his partner. Even if he apologized, the author feels he still holds that belief. The boyfriend's behavior here indicates a problem with competitiveness and gender roles where he feels threatened by her success, which is a red flag.\n\nThe author is upset because she wants independence and equality in the relationship. She's not being overly sensitive if she's in a relationship where the partner's actions and comments consistently undermine her autonomy and work ethic. The boyfriend's behavior crosses into sexist territory by belittling her work and insisting on financial control, which are not healthy in a relationship that's supposed to be equal.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for breaking up over this? Probably not. She's standing up for herself against behavior that's disrespectful and based on outdated gender roles. The boyfriend's actions are the issue here, not the author's sensitivity. She's recognizing that his views are incompatible with her values of independence and equality. So, the answer should be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
