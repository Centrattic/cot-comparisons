My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. So, the user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The question is about whether the author (18F) is at fault for thinking her boyfriend is sexist and wanting to break up with him. Let me break down the key points from the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author comes from a traditional family but her parents raised her to be independent. Her father works, her mother stays home, but they don't push that lifestyle on their daughters. They emphasize hard work, self-reliance, and college. The author mows lawns in the summer, which she enjoys, as a way to earn money. \n\nThe boyfriend, from a traditional family, has different views. He expressed that if he were her dad, he'd be ashamed of her mowing lawns in the heat. He insists on paying for everything, including small things like snacks, and gets upset when she buys something for him. During rock climbing, he was mad she outperformed him and made excuses. Later, he said he'd always make more money than her and couldn't date someone with a higher salary. She called him out, he apologized, but she feels he still holds those views. She's tired of being treated like a princess and wants to break up because he's too old-fashioned.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key here is whether the boyfriend's actions and views are indeed sexist, and whether the author is justified in breaking up over this. The boyfriend's comments and behaviors cross into disrespecting her work, enforcing traditional gender roles, and implying his superiority in earnings. The author values independence and equality, which are valid personal values. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction to her mowing lawns was condescending, suggesting her work is beneath her. His insistence on paying for everything, even small things, might stem from a desire to be a \"gentleman,\" but it also undermines her autonomy. The comment about always making more money and not dating someone higher-paid is clearly sexist and disrespectful. \n\nThe author's feelings are valid because these actions and beliefs conflict with her values. She's not being overly sensitive; she's recognizing that his views on gender roles are incompatible with her own. The boyfriend's apologies seem to be more about avoiding conflict than genuine change. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to end the relationship over these issues. The boyfriend's behavior is problematic, and the author is justified in seeking a partner whose values align with hers. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
