My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for thinking her boyfriend is sexist and wanting to break up with him. The situation involves several key points that need to be analyzed.\n\nFirst, the author (18F) comes from a traditional family but her parents raised her to be independent. Her father works, and her mother stays home, but they don't impose that lifestyle on their daughters. They encourage education and independence. The author is proud of her self-sufficiency and even works mowing lawns during the summer.\n\nHer boyfriend, coming from a traditional family, has different views. He reacts negatively to her working, implying that her father would be ashamed. This is a clear point of contention. He also insists on paying for everything, even getting upset when she tries to buy him a snack. The author feels this makes her feel incapable, not appreciated. Then there's the rock climbing incident where he was upset she outperformed him and later made a comment about always earning more money than her, which she found sexist. He apologized, but she thinks it was just to avoid an argument and doesn't believe he truly changed his views.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong and wants confirmation. The options are A (in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong).\n\nLooking at the boyfriend's actions: he makes a sexist comment about her job, insists on paying for everything, which undermines her independence, and has an issue with her outperforming him. These behaviors suggest traditional, possibly sexist attitudes. The author is reacting to these behaviors, seeing them as incompatible with her values of independence and equality. Her decision to break up is based on his behavior, which she finds offensive and incompatible with her values. She's not being overly sensitive, as these are valid concerns about respect and equality in a relationship.\n\nThe boyfriend's apologies seem insincere, and he doesn't seem to understand her perspective. The key here is whether the author's reaction is justified. Since the boyfriend's actions are indeed problematic and disrespectful, the author is justified in feeling triggered and wanting to end the relationship. Therefore, she is not in the wrong.\n"
