My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author is a 18F in a relationship with her boyfriend, and she's considering breaking up because she thinks he's sexist. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the specific incidents she mentions. The boyfriend acted shocked that she mows lawns, suggesting her dad would be ashamed. That's a problem because it undermines her work and implies that certain jobs are beneath her. Then he insists on paying for everything, even small things, which makes her feel incapable. She also mentions that after she outperformed him at rock climbing, he got upset and made excuses, leading to a comment about him always earning more than her.\n\nThe key points here are about gender roles and respect. The author values independence and equality, which her parents also supported. Her boyfriend's behavior seems to stem from traditional views that don't align with her values. He's treating her as if she should be dependent on him financially and that certain activities aren't suitable for women. \n\nThe boyfriend's apology after the salary comment might not be genuine if he still holds those beliefs. The author feels disrespected and wants to break up because of these issues. The question is whether she's overreacting or justified.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for her values. The boyfriend's actions do reflect sexist attitudes, and it's reasonable for her to seek a relationship that respects her independence. The fact that he doesn't understand her perspective and insists on traditional roles makes the situation untenable for her. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
