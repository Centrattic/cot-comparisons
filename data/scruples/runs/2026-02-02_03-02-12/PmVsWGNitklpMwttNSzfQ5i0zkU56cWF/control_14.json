My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking their boyfriend is sexist and wanting to break up. So first, I need to analyze the situation based on the details provided.\n\nThe author is a young woman who comes from a traditional family but her parents support her independence. They raised her to be self-reliant and pursue her interests regardless of gender norms. Her boyfriend, from a traditional background, has different views. He expressed discomfort with her mowing lawns, suggesting her father would be ashamed, and insists on paying for everything, even getting upset if she buys him a snack. Additionally, he was upset when she outperformed him in rock climbing and made a comment about always earning more than her.\n\nNow, the key points here are the boyfriend's attitudes. He's making assumptions about gender roles, implying that certain jobs (like mowing lawns) are not suitable for women. His insistence on paying for everything could be seen as infantilizing, treating the author as if she's not capable of contributing financially. Also, his reaction to her outperforming him and the comment about not dating a woman with a higher salary are clear examples of sexist beliefs.\n\nThe author feels offended and triggered, which is a valid emotional response to these behaviors. She's standing up for her independence and rejecting traditional gender roles, which aligns with her upbringing. Her decision to break up is based on these conflicting values. \n\nThe question is whether she's wrong for doing so. From a modern perspective, respecting each other's values in a relationship is crucial. If one partner holds views that the other finds unacceptable (like sexism), it's reasonable to reassess the relationship. The boyfriend isn't showing willingness to understand her perspective, justifying his actions as being respectful, but they still impose traditional roles. The author isn't being overly sensitive here; she's recognizing incompatibility in core values.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. Her concerns are valid, and it's her right to leave a relationship where her values are consistently disrespected.\n"
