My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author (a 18-year-old woman) having a boyfriend whose views she considers sexist. The key points are about the boyfriend's reactions to her mowing lawns, expecting to pay for everything, and his comment about always making more money than her.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the boyfriend's behavior. The boyfriend is from a traditional family, which might influence his views. However, the author emphasizes her independence, which her parents also support. The boyfriend's reaction to her mowing lawns is dismissive and even insulting, implying that her father would be ashamed. That's problematic because it undermines her work and independence. \n\nThen there's the insistence on paying for everything. While some people appreciate gentlemen's gestures, the boyfriend's behavior becomes controlling by not allowing her to buy anything for him and getting upset about it. This could be seen as infantilizing her, making her feel incapable instead of respected as an equal partner.\n\nThe rock climbing incident and the comment about always making more money are significant. The boyfriend's defensive excuses and the statement about salary suggest a belief in traditional gender roles where men should be the higher earners. Even though he apologized, the author feels he hasn't truly changed his mindset, just avoided conflict.\n\nThe author is questioning if she's being overly sensitive. But considering the context, her actions make sense. She values independence, and her boyfriend's behavior contradicts that. The fact that her parents raised her to be self-sufficient adds to her sensitivity about these issues.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the boyfriend's actions display sexist tendencies by not supporting her independence and enforcing traditional roles. The author is justified in feeling offended and deciding to break up. The boyfriend's apologies seem insincere if he hasn't genuinely changed his views. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship based on these principles.\n"
