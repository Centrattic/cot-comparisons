My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a girl named I, 18 years old, from a traditional family where the dad works and the mom stays home. But her parents don't push that lifestyle on her; they just say it's what works for them. They emphasize hard work and self-reliance, and they support their daughters' interests regardless of traditional gender roles. She feels grateful because she's independent and self-sufficient, which is helping her feel ready for the future.\n\nHer boyfriend comes from a traditional family too, but his views are different from hers. One example is when he found out she mows lawns for extra cash. He's shocked and says that if he were her dad, he'd be ashamed of her doing that in the heat. He tells her she should just ask him for money instead. She finds this offensive because it insults her dad and she actually likes mowing lawns. She tells him this, but he doesn't get it.\n\nHe also insists on paying for everything. While she's okay with him paying on dates, she feels he goes too far. She can't buy anything for him, even small snacks, and he gets upset. This makes her feel incapable instead of appreciated. \n\nOn a recent rock climbing trip, she outperformed him, and he was angry, making excuses. Later, he said he'd always make more money than her and couldn't date a woman with a higher salary. She called him out, he apologized, but she thinks he just wanted to avoid an argument and still holds that view. She's tired of being treated like a princess and feels he's too traditional (50s era) for her. She's considering breaking up with him and is wondering if she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for thinking her boyfriend is sexist and wanting to break up.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the boyfriend's behavior. When she mows lawns, he's ashamed of her doing that, implying that it's beneath her as a woman. That's a clear example of sexist attitude because it's judging her based on her gender. Then, he insists on paying for everything, which could be a traditional gender role where men are supposed to support women financially. However, when she tries to contribute, he gets upset, which undermines her autonomy and makes her feel incapable. This could be controlling behavior. \n\nWhen she outperforms him in rock climbing, he gets angry and makes excuses. Then, his statement about needing to make more money than her is overtly sexist, as it's based on the idea that a man should be the higher earner in a relationship, which is a traditional view but not acceptable in modern times where both partners can have equal or varying financial roles based on their individual circumstances.\n\nThe author is standing up for her independence and values, which her parents have supported. She feels that his behavior is disrespectful to her and her choices, which are important to her. Since they come from traditional backgrounds but have different interpretations, their values conflict.\n\nThe boyfriend's apologies seem insincere if he still holds those views. The author is not being overly sensitive; she's recognizing that his actions and statements are sexist and not aligned with her values of equality and independence. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong for wanting to break up. Her boyfriend's behavior is the issue, not her for recognizing and acting on those issues.\n"
