My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is a 18-year-old female who's considering breaking up with her boyfriend because of his sexist views. She comes from a traditional family but they don't push their lifestyle on her. Her parents encourage her to be independent, and she values that.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior includes acting ashamed she mows lawns, insisting on paying for everything, and making a comment about not dating a woman who earns more. The author feels offended and that he doesn't respect her independence. She's trying to decide if she's justified in breaking up with him.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's remarks about her job: when he says if he were her dad, he would be ashamed, that's clearly objecting to her work, which is a traditional male task. That's a problem because it undermines her independence and the value of her work. \n\nThen, his insistence on paying for everything. While some people appreciate chivalry, the key here is that he gets upset if she buys anything for him. The author is self-sufficient and doesn't want to rely on him financially. His reaction makes her feel incapable, which can be controlling. \n\nThe rock climbing incident where he was upset she outperformed him, and then the comment about never making more money. This suggests he has traditional gender roles and a need to be superior in some way. Even though he apologized, the author feels he only did so to avoid conflict and still holds those views. \n\nThe author is in a relationship where her values of independence and equality are conflicting with his traditional views. She's not being overly sensitive if she finds these behaviors sexist. The question is whether she's in the wrong for finding this unacceptable. \n\nIn relationships, values and respect are important. If one person's actions consistently clash with the other's values, it's valid to leave. The boyfriend's comments and actions aren't just personal preferences but indicate a lack of support for her autonomy. So the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to break up. Answer B.\n"
