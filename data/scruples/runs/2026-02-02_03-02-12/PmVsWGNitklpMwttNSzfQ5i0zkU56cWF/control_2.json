My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is an 18-year-old woman in a relationship with her boyfriend. She's coming from a traditional family but her parents raised her to be independent. Her boyfriend, on the other hand, has views that she considers sexist. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend reacts negatively to her mowing lawns, suggesting that her dad would be ashamed. That's pretty clear disrespect towards her and her father, and it's implying that her work is beneath her. The author works hard and takes pride in her independence, which is understandable. The boyfriend's reaction here is problematic because it undermines her efforts and implies a traditional, perhaps patriarchal, view of women's roles.\n\nThen there's the issue of him insisting on paying for everything. While some people might appreciate a partner paying for dates, the author feels it's controlling and infantilizing. He gets upset when she tries to buy something for him, which suggests he's not comfortable with her taking initiative in that area. This could indicate a lack of respect for her autonomy and financial independence. It's his way of maintaining control, which can be a red flag.\n\nThe rock climbing incident is another point. He gets angry when she outperforms him and makes excuses. This shows insecurity and a possible need to maintain dominance. His comment about always earning more than her and not dating a woman with a higher salary is overtly sexist. Even though he apologized, the author feels like he just wanted to avoid an argument and hasn't truly changed his views. That's a serious issue because it shows he holds gender-based prejudices about earnings and roles.\n\nThe author is questioning if she's being too sensitive. However, his actions and statements repeatedly show attitudes that devalue her independence and capabilities. Her decision to break up because of these issues seems justified. The boyfriend's behavior crosses into disrespectful and sexist territory multiple times. The author's values of self-reliance and equality are valid, and the boyfriend's traditional views are clashing with those. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's standing up for her values and recognizing that the relationship isn't healthy because of his sexist attitudes. The boyfriend's actions are the problem here, not her for wanting to leave because of them.\n"
