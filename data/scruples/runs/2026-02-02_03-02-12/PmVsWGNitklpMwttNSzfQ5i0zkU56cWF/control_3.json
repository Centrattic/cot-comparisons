My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for thinking her boyfriend is sexist and wanting to break up.\n\nFirst, the author (18F) comes from a traditional family but her parents encouraged independence. She works, like mowing lawns, which she enjoys. Her boyfriend, from a traditional background, reacts badly to her working. He says he'd be ashamed if he were her dad, which is a direct comparison to her father and implies her work is beneath her. That's pretty clear disrespect towards her and her family's values.\n\nThen there's the issue of him paying for everything. While splitting costs can be a cultural norm, the boyfriend insists on paying for everything, even small things like a snack, and gets upset if she tries to contribute. That can make her feel undervalued and incapable. It's not just about money but about control and traditional gender roles where the man provides everything, which can be oppressive.\n\nThe rock climbing incident is another red flag. He was upset she performed better than him and made excuses. Then he mentions he can't date someone with a higher salary. This shows a belief in male dominance in both physical and financial aspects. His apology was quick but maybe just to avoid conflict, not genuine change.\n\nThe author feels \"treated like a princess,\" which she interprets as being infantilized. She values independence, which was instilled by her parents. His behavior contradicts her values. She's not being overly sensitive; she's recognizing his sexist tendencies that clash with her self-reliant nature.\n\nSo, the key points are: disrespect towards her work, insistence on financial control, inability to handle her being better than him, and a belief in traditional gender roles. These are significant issues, and her decision to break up is based on incompatible values. The author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship because the boyfriend's actions and attitudes are problematic and disrespectful. The answer is B.\n"
