My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author (a girl in a relationship with a boy) is in the wrong for thinking her boyfriend is sexist and wanting to break up because of it. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author comes from a traditional family but her parents don't push their lifestyle on her. They value hard work, self-reliance, and education. The boyfriend also comes from a traditional family but his views differ. He makes comments that the author finds sexist, like being shocked she mows lawns and insists on paying for everything. Also, after she outperformed him in rock climbing, he got upset and said he couldn't date a woman who earns more.\n\nThe author feels that her boyfriend's actions and beliefs are outdated and offensive. She values independence and doesn't want to rely on him financially. She's considering breaking up but is unsure if she's overreacting.\n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong. The key points are the boyfriend's comments and behavior that the author perceives as sexist. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Comment on Mowing Lawns**: The boyfriend said he'd be ashamed if he were her dad. This implies a double standard where he thinks a daughter shouldn't do such work, which the author's family does not enforce. This is a clear example of sexist belief as he's judging her job choice based on gender stereotypes.\n\n2. **Insisting on Paying for Everything**: While it's common for some to let the person they're dating pay on dates, the boyfriend's insistence on controlling all expenses and getting upset if she tries to buy something small for him could be seen as condescending. It might make her feel like her contributions are not valued, reinforcing traditional gender roles where men should handle all finances.\n\n3. **Reaction to Her Outperforming Him**: After she did better in rock climbing, he was upset and made excuses. Then, when discussing future careers, he said he couldn't date a woman who earns more. This is a direct expression of sexism, suggesting a belief that women shouldn't be higher earners in a relationship, which perpetuates outdated norms about gender roles.\n\nThe author's feelings of being treated like a princess and the boyfriend's apology that seems insincere add to her frustration. She's standing up for her values of independence and equality, which are valid. The boyfriend's actions and statements are based on traditional, possibly sexist views that conflict with her more modern perspective. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for ending the relationship because of this. Since the boyfriend is making her feel incapable and is holding onto sexist beliefs, her decision to leave is justified. The user's premise is that she's not in the wrong, which aligns with the analysis here. So the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
