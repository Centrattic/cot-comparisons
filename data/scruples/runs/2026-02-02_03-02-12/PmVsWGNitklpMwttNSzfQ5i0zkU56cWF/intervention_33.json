My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The author is a 18-year-old woman who's breaking up with her boyfriend because she finds him sexist. The boyfriend comes from a traditional family and has certain views that clash with her values.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author mentions that her boyfriend was shocked she mows lawns, implying he thinks it's beneath her. He says if he were her dad, he'd be ashamed. That's pretty clear sexism, right? He's judging her for doing physical work, especially a job that's often associated with men. Then there's the insistence on paying for everything. While some people like that gesture, the author feels it makes her feel incapable and infantilizes her. Also, after she outperformed him in rock climbing, he got upset and made excuses. Then there's the comment about her salary being lower than his in their dream careers. He even said he couldn't date someone making more than him, which is overt sexism. He apologized but the author feels he's just avoiding conflict.\n\nThe author's parents are traditional but they don't push that onto their daughters. They encourage independence and self-reliance. The author is proud of her independence and values being self-sufficient. So, the clash here is between her values and the boyfriend's traditional views.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong for breaking up over this. The options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFrom my perspective, the boyfriend's behavior is problematic. The comments about her job, the need to pay for everything, and the salary comment all point to sexist attitudes. The author has valid reasons to feel disrespected. The boyfriend might not realize how his actions come off, but that doesn't excuse them. The author is standing up for her values and self-respect, which is reasonable. Breaking up over sexism isn't overreacting; it's a matter of incompatible values. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (not in the wrong). The author is justified in her feelings and decision to end the relationship.\n"
