My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship because her boyfriend is sexist. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that her boyfriend is shocked that she mows lawns for extra money. He says that if he were her dad, he'd be ashamed, implying that he thinks it's inappropriate for a daughter to do such work. That's a clear gender stereotype, assuming that mowing lawns is not a suitable job for a woman. The author values her independence and the ability to earn her own money, which her parents also encouraged. His reaction here is definitely problematic.\n\nNext, the boyfriend insists on paying for everything, even small things like a snack. While some people might appreciate being treated, the author feels it makes her feel incapable and not appreciated. The boyfriend's insistence is rigid and doesn't allow her to contribute, which can be a sign of unequal treatment based on gender. The author is right to feel that this dynamic might not be healthy if it's based on traditional gender roles.\n\nThen, after a rock climbing session where she outperformed him, he got angry and made excuses. The author didn't even say anything about his performance, so his reaction was unnecessary and possibly due to his ego or sexist assumptions about her ability. \n\nWhen she called him out on the comment about him always making more money, he apologized but the author feels it was just to avoid an argument. This suggests he might not have truly changed his views, which is a red flag in a relationship. \n\nThe author is in a relationship where her partner's views on gender roles conflict with her own values of independence and equality. She's taking a stand against what she perceives as sexist behavior, which is a personal choice. Whether the boyfriend's actions are sexist or just traditional is subjective, but the author is not in the wrong for ending the relationship if his behavior is making her uncomfortable or if she can't accept his views.\n"
