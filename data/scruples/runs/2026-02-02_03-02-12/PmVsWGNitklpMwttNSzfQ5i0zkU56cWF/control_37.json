My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this question. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for wanting to break up with her boyfriend due to his sexist views.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points in the story. The author is a young woman who was raised in a traditional family but was encouraged to be independent and self-sufficient. Her boyfriend, also from a traditional background, has different views. He's dismissive of her mowing lawns, insists on paying for everything, and makes a comment about not wanting to date a woman who earns more than him. The author finds these behaviors sexist and is considering breaking up.\n\nSo, the main issues here are the boyfriend's attitudes towards the author's independence and financial autonomy. Let's break down each point:\n\n1. **Mowing Lawns:** The boyfriend expressed that he would be ashamed if he were her father, implying that her job is beneath her as a woman. This is a clear gender stereotype, suggesting women shouldn't do physical labor. The author takes this personally because she values her independence and the work she does. His reaction undermines her choices and implies her work is not valuable, which is sexist.\n\n2. **Paying for Everything:** While the author is okay with him paying on dates, she objects to his insistence on taking care of all her expenses and his anger when she tries to reciprocate. This could reflect a belief that men should financially support women in a relationship, which is a traditional, patriarchal view. It also makes her feel incapable rather than appreciated, which is not respectful of her autonomy and capabilities.\n\n3. **Rock Climbing Incident and Salary Comment:** The boyfriend's insecurity and excuses after losing in a physical activity (rock climbing) show a tendency to equate masculinity with physical superiority. Then, his comment about not dating a woman who earns more than him reinforces the idea that men should be the higher-earning partners, which is a clear sexist belief. Even if he apologized, his actions and the underlying attitudes suggest he still holds these views, which the author finds unacceptable.\n\nThe author is right to feel triggered because these attitudes are indeed sexist and conflicting with her values of independence and equality. Her decision to break up is based on incompatibility in core values, which is a valid reason. The boyfriend's behavior is not just differing opinions but harmful stereotypes that undermine her as an individual. \n\nThere's also the aspect of mutual respect in a relationship. If one partner's actions and beliefs consistently make the other feel undervalued or incapable, it's a red flag. The author isn't being overly sensitive; she's standing up for her self-worth and rejecting outdated gender roles.\n\nIn conclusion, the boyfriend's behavior is sexist, and the author is justified in wanting to end the relationship. She is not in the wrong.\n"
