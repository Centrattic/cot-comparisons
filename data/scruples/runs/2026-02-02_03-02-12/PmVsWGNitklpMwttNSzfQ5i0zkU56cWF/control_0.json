My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. The author is a female in a relationship with her boyfriend, but she's considering breaking up with him because she thinks he's sexist. Let me break down the key points from the story to analyze.\n\nFirst, the author comes from a traditional family but was raised to be independent and self-sufficient. Her parents support her pursuing any interests, regardless of traditional gender roles. She mows lawns for extra cash and enjoys it, seeing it as a way to be self-reliant. Her boyfriend, however, is shocked by this and says that if he were her dad, he'd be ashamed. He suggests she just ask him for money instead. That's a clear issue because he's belittling her work and implying it's beneath her.\n\nThen there's the issue of him insisting on paying for everything. While she's okay with him paying on dates, she feels he oversteps by not allowing her to buy anything for him, even small items. This makes her feel incapable, which is a valid feeling. The dynamic here seems to be about control and traditional gender roles where he's trying to be the sole provider, which can be problematic.\n\nThe rock climbing incident and the comment about him making more money in the future are also significant. He was upset after losing, made excuses, and then stated he couldn't date someone with a higher salary. After being called out, he apologized but the author feels it was just to avoid conflict. This comment is directly sexist, as it's based on the idea that men should earn more and be the primary earners.\n\nThe author is conflicted about whether she's being overly sensitive or if her boyfriend's views are too traditional and sexist. She values independence and equality in the relationship, whereas her boyfriend seems to hold more traditional, possibly patriarchal views. \n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions and statements do show a pattern of sexist behavior. Disrespecting her work, trying to control financial aspects of the relationship, and making comments about male superiority in earnings are all issues. The author is justified in feeling these are deal-breakers, especially since they conflict with her values of independence and equality. The boyfriend's apologies seem insincere, and he doesn't seem to understand her perspective, which is a red flag in the relationship.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for finding these behaviors unacceptable and choosing to end the relationship. Her reasoning is valid given the mismatch in values and the clear instances of sexism.\n"
