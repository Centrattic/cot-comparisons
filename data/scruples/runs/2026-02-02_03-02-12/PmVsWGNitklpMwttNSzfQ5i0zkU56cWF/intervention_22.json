My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The main points from the story are about the boyfriend's sexist attitudes and behaviors, which the author finds unacceptable.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend reacts negatively to the author mowing lawns, suggesting that he would be ashamed if he were her father. This implies he doesn't respect her work and implies a traditional view of women's roles. Then he insists on paying for everything, even getting upset if she tries to buy him small things. This could be seen as controlling or infantilizing her, as he's taking away her autonomy in financial decisions. \n\nThen, after the rock climbing incident where she outperformed him, he was upset and made excuses, and then mentioned he couldn't date a woman who earns more. This is a clear statement of sexism, assuming men should be the higher earners. The author feels this is part of a pattern of treating her as a princess rather than an equal, which conflicts with her values of independence and equality.\n\nThe author is from a family that encourages independence in their daughters, so her values are likely more modern and equal. The boyfriend's actions and comments seem to stem from traditional, possibly outdated, gender roles. The key here is whether the boyfriend's behavior is sexist and if the author is justified in wanting to end the relationship over it.\n\nThe author's feelings are valid because she's confronting behaviors that undermine her independence and equality. The boyfriend's apologies might be insincere if he doesn't genuinely change his views. The author isn't being overly sensitive; she's standing up for her values. So, the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
