My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author (18F) breaking up with her boyfriend because she thinks he's sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author comes from a traditional family but her parents allowed her and her sisters independence. They encourage education and self-reliance. The boyfriend, also from a traditional family, has some views that clash with hers.\n\nThe main issues listed are:\n1. The boyfriend said he'd be ashamed if he were her dad for her mowing lawns, suggesting she should ask him for money instead. The author finds this offensive because she likes the work and values her independence.\n2. He insists on paying for everything, even getting upset if she buys him a snack. This makes her feel incapable.\n3. After she beat him at rock climbing, he made excuses and later stated he couldn't date someone with a higher salary. He apologized but she thinks he's just avoiding conflict.\n\nThe author feels he's sexist, treating her like a princess instead of an equal. She's considering breaking up, thinking he's too traditional (\"50s\" style). The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nNow, analyzing from different angles. The boyfriend's comments about being ashamed if he were her dad definitely touch on traditional gender roles, implying that women shouldn't be doing manual labor like mowing lawns. That's a classic sexist statement. His insistence on paying for everything and getting upset if she spends her own money on him also shows a lack of respect for her autonomy. Wanting equality in financial contributions is reasonable, and his reaction suggests he doesn't value her independence.\n\nThe comment about making more money is problematic too. Believing that a woman shouldn't earn more than her partner is a clear example of sexist attitudes. The fact that he made excuses after losing at rock climbing shows insecurity and possibly a need to maintain dominance, which could indicate deeper issues about his view of relationships.\n\nThe author is being self-aware, recognizing her own traits (independent to a fault, maybe overly sensitive) but also standing by her values. The boyfriend's behavior is consistent with traditional, patriarchal views, which clash with her more modern, egalitarian upbringing. She's not wrong for wanting a relationship where both partners are equal and respect each other's independence.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the boyfriend's actions and statements are clearly problematic. The author has every right to feel disrespected and to want to end the relationship if these issues aren't resolved. The boyfriend's apologies seem insincere, aimed at avoiding conflict rather than genuine change.\n\nSo the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
