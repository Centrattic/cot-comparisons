My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is a 18-year-old female who comes from a traditional family but was raised to be independent. Her boyfriend, from a traditional family too, has different views. The key points are his reactions to her mowing lawns, insisting on paying for everything, and his comment about making more money.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's reaction to her mowing lawns. He says he'd be ashamed if he were her dad, which is an insult to her father's choice. The author values her independence, so his comment is dismissive of her work and undermines her family's values. That's a problem because it's not respecting her autonomy.\n\nThen, he insists on paying for everything and gets upset if she buys anything for him. While some guys paying on dates is a traditional gesture, the author feels it makes her incapable. This could be a form of financial control or treating her as a princess, which she doesn't like. The boyfriend isn't seeing her perspective here, which is about equality in the relationship.\n\nThe rock climbing incident and his comment about making more money. He's making excuses for his performance and then stating he can't date someone with a higher salary. That's a clear sexist viewpoint, assuming that the man should be the higher earner. The author calls him out, and he apologizes but she feels he probably still holds that belief. This shows a lack of growth and respect for her ambitions.\n\nThe author is considering breaking up because of these issues, thinking he's too traditional and sexist. The question is if she's in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions and comments do show sexist attitudes, disrespecting her independence, and expecting traditional gender roles. She's standing up for herself, which is valid. So the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
