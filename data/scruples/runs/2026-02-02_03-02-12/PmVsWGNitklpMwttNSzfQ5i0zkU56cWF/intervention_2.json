My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking her boyfriend is sexist and wanting to break up. Let me go through the details.\n\nFirst, the author's parents have a traditional setup but don't push it on their daughters. They encourage independence and education. The author takes pride in being self-sufficient, like mowing lawns for extra cash. Her boyfriend's reaction is that he'd be ashamed if he were her dad, which insults her father and undermines her work. That seems sexist because he's implying a woman shouldn't be doing that kind of work.\n\nThen there's the insistence on paying for everything. While some might see it as chivalrous, the author feels it makes her feel incapable. The key here is mutual respect. If he's not allowing her to contribute, it could be controlling. Plus, when she buys him a snack, he gets upset, which shows he doesn't value her contributions.\n\nThe rock climbing incident and his reaction to her being better than him might indicate insecurity or traditional views on gender roles. His comment about always making more money is overtly sexist. Even though he apologized, the author suspects it was just to avoid conflict, which suggests he might not truly understand or care about her perspective.\n\nThe author is clear about her values of independence and equality. She's not being overly sensitive; she's standing up for herself in a relationship where her values are being challenged. The boyfriend's actions consistently show a traditional, possibly sexist, viewpoint that conflicts with her beliefs.\n\nSo, the author is right to feel that her boyfriend's behavior is sexist and to want to break up. Her perspective is valid because the relationship isn't meeting her needs for equality and mutual respect. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
