My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the user is an 18-year-old woman from a traditional family but her parents are actually pretty supportive of her independence. Her boyfriend, on the other hand, has traditional views that clash with her values. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend reacted negatively when she mows lawns for extra cash. He said if he were her dad, he'd be ashamed. That's a problem because it disrespects both her and her father. She's happy with her job and it's a form of self-reliance. The boyfriend's reaction seems sexist because he's assuming a job like mowing lawns is beneath her and that she should be dependant on him for money.\n\nThen there's the issue of him insisting on paying for everything. While it's common for men to pay on dates, the fact that he gets upset if she buys anything for him, even a small snack, suggests he's enforcing traditional gender roles where she's supposed to be completely dependent. This could make her feel infantilized instead of respected as an equal partner.\n\nThe rock climbing incident and the comment about making more money are also key. He got upset after she outperformed him and then made a statement about not dating a woman with a higher salary. That's clearly sexist because it's based on the assumption that men should earn more and be the primary breadwinners. His apology might have been insincere, which adds to the problem of not taking her concerns seriously.\n\nThe author is feeling triggered because these actions and comments go against her values of independence. Her parents raised her to be self-sufficient, so the boyfriend's behavior is in conflict with that upbringing. She's not being overly sensitive; she's standing up for her beliefs and recognizing that his views are restrictive and outdated.\n\nThe boyfriend's justification that he's being respectful by treating her like a princess is part of the issue. Treating someone as unequal isn't respect; it's condescending. The author has every right to want a partner who supports her independence and equality rather than trying to enforce traditional roles.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author isn't in the wrong. She's justified in feeling that her boyfriend's actions are sexist and that their relationship is built on incompatible values. Wanting to break up because of these issues is a reasonable response.\n"
