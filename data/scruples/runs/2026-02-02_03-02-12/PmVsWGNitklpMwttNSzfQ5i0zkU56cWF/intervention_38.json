My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is a 18-year-old woman who's in a relationship with her boyfriend. She's coming from a traditional family but her parents are progressive in raising their daughters to be independent. Her boyfriend, on the other hand, has some views that she finds sexist. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend comments about her mowing lawns. He's shocked and says he would be ashamed if he were her dad. The author takes offense because it's an insult to her father and she enjoys the work. Then there's the issue of him insisting on paying for everything, even small things like snacks, which makes her feel incapable. Then during rock climbing, he gets mad when she outperforms him and makes excuses. He also says he can't date a girl who makes more money than him. The author feels he's sexist and wants to break up.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break down each point. \n\nThe boyfriend's comments about mowing the lawn: expecting a woman to not do certain jobs because of traditional gender roles is sexist. By saying he would be ashamed, he's implying that her work is beneath her, which is a problem. The author is right to take offense because it's an attack on her independence.\n\nThe boyfriend insisting on paying for everything. While paying for dates is a common gesture, refusing to let her buy anything for him, even small items, can be controlling. It's about mutual respect and equality in the relationship. If he throws a fit when she tries to contribute, that's a red flag. Healthy relationships involve both partners contributing, and being able to do things for each other without pressure.\n\nThe rock climbing incident and his reaction to her outperforming him. He's making excuses and getting angry, which shows insecurity and perhaps a belief in male dominance. Then the comment about not dating someone who makes more money than him is a clear example of sexist belief. Even after apologizing, the author feels he's just avoiding an argument and doesn't truly change his views.\n\nThe author's response is to feel triggered and want to break up. She's standing up for her values of independence and equality. Her parents taught her to be self-sufficient, so she's not being overly sensitive. The boyfriend's actions are inconsistent with her values. \n\nIn relationships, it's important that both partners respect each other's values. If he's unwilling to adapt or if his actions clearly show sexist tendencies despite apologies, it's valid for her to end the relationship. She's not being wrong for prioritizing her independence and equality. The boyfriend is in the wrong for his actions and the author is right to address it.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
