My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking her boyfriend is sexist and wanting to break up. The scenario is from an AITA (Am I the Asshole) post.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author is 18F, comes from a traditional family but her parents are supportive of her independence. Her boyfriend, from a traditional family too, has different views. Examples of his behavior include being shocked she mows lawns, insisting on paying for everything, getting upset when she outperforms him in rock climbing, and saying he can't date someone who earns more.\n\nThe key points here are about gender roles and expectations. The boyfriend's comments and actions suggest he has traditional, possibly sexist views. He's undermining her independence and implying that her work is shameful, that he should be the sole provider, and that his male pride is hurt when she's better at something. The author feels respected when she's able to work and be self-sufficient, which her parents encouraged. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for finding his behavior sexist. From a modern perspective, the boyfriend's actions are problematic. His comments about her job, insistence on paying for everything, and comments about salary all point towards a belief in traditional gender roles where men are the providers and women are to be taken care of. The author is not wrong for wanting to end a relationship with someone who holds these views, especially since they conflict with her values of independence and equality.\n\nPossible counterarguments might be that the boyfriend is just being a traditional guy and that the author is being overly sensitive. However, in today's context, expecting a partner to not work, to be financially dependent, and to believe in unequal earnings in a relationship is considered sexist. The author's parents even support her independence, which reinforces her stance.\n\nSo the conclusion here is that the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue, not hers. She has valid reasons to feel insulted and to seek a breakup based on incompatible values. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
