My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking her boyfriend is sexist and wanting to break up with him. The author is 18F, from a traditional family but her parents didn't push traditional gender roles on her. They encouraged her to be independent and work hard. Her boyfriend comes from a traditional background but his actions and comments seem to reflect more traditional, maybe even sexist, views.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's reactions to her mowing lawns. He's shocked and says he'd be ashamed if he were her dad. That's a problem because he's dismissing her choice to work and even comparing it to his (hypothetical) standards. He offers money instead, which might come from a place of wanting to provide, but it's not respecting her independence. She likes the work, so his comment is not only invalidating her but also belittling her father's approval. That's a red flag.\n\nThen there's the insisting on paying for everything. While it's common for guys to pay on dates, the boyfriend takes it to an extreme where he gets upset if she buys anything for him. That's controlling and makes her feel incapable. Healthy relationships should allow mutual respect and independence. Making her feel like she can't contribute financially or make purchases for him is not healthy.\n\nThe rock climbing incident and his subsequent comments about wanting to always earn more than her. Even after she outperformed him, he made excuses. Then the statement about not dating someone with a higher salary is clearly sexist. The fact that he apologized but maybe didn't truly mean it shows a lack of genuine respect for her. If he can't accept her success or independence, that's a big issue.\n\nThe author is feeling like she's being treated like a princess, which conflicts with her values of self-reliance. She's aware of her own independence and is questioning if she's being too sensitive. But the signs are there: his behavior is undermining her autonomy and reinforcing gender stereotypes. The author has the right to be in a relationship where her independence is respected. Wanting to break up because of these issues is justified. The boyfriend's actions are problematic and not aligned with her values. So, she's not in the wrong.\n"
