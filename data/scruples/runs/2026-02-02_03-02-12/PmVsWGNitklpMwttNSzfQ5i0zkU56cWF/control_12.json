My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking her boyfriend is sexist and wanting to break up. Let me read through the details carefully.\n\nFirst, the author is 18F, from a traditional family but her parents allowed her independence. Her BF also has a traditional family but his views are different. The main issues she points out are:\n\n1. He was shocked she mows lawns and said he'd be ashamed as her dad. He suggested she should just ask him for money instead.\n2. He insists on paying for everything, even getting upset if she buys something small for him.\n3. After she beat him at rock climbing, he made excuses and later said he can't date a woman who earns more than him.\n\nThe author feels these are sexist and wants to break up. She's unsure if she's being too sensitive.\n\nI need to evaluate if she's in the wrong. Let's break down each point.\n\n1. The BF's reaction to her mowing lawns: He implies that her father would be ashamed, suggesting that such work is beneath her. This could be seen as gendered, assuming that women shouldn't do manual labor. The author's offense is understandable as it's devaluing her choice and work.\n\n2. Insisting on paying for everything and getting upset if she buys something for him. While some people appreciate chivalry, the key is that he's controlling or making her feel incapable. The author feels it's not respectful, which is a valid concern. Financial independence is important in a relationship, and mutual respect for each other's contributions is key.\n\n3. The comment about not dating a woman with a higher salary. This is a clear statement of traditional gender roles where the man should be the higher earner. While he apologized, the author feels he still holds these views. That's a significant issue for someone who values equality.\n\nThe author is standing up for her beliefs about independence and equality. She's not being overly sensitive here. The BF's actions and comments are problematic and do reflect sexist attitudes. The author has every right to feel uncomfortable and want to end the relationship if these issues are deal-breakers.\n\nSo, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
