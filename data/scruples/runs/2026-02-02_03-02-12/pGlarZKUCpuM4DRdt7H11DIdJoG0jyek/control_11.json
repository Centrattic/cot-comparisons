In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad\" after their parents' divorce and remarriage. The stepfather isn't very nice, there are arguments, and the author feels he isn't a real father figure. The mom got angry when the author said, \"he's not my dad.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's biological father isn't in the picture since the parents divorced. The mother remarried, and the stepfather is now part of the family. The author is struggling with the idea of calling someone who hasn't built a relationship with them as a father figure. The mother is upset because the author isn't accepting her new husband as a father.\n\nLegally, the stepfather isn't the author's biological father, but socially and emotionally, there might be expectations of family roles. However, the stepfather hasn't made efforts to build a relationship, and their interactions are contentious. The author's reluctance seems justified because the term \"Dad\" implies a certain level of relationship and acceptance that isn't present here.\n\nThe mother's reaction is based on her desire for her child to accept her new spouse as a father figure. However, if the stepfather hasn't earned that role through actions and effort, the author isn't obligated to use that term. The mother might be projecting her own expectations onto the author without considering their feelings or the stepfather's behavior.\n\nIn terms of social norms, family dynamics are complex. The stepfather's behavior (arguing, not getting to know the author) contributes to the author's resistance. The author isn't being disrespectful just for not using the term, especially if the stepfather isn't fulfilling a fatherly role. The mother's anger might be more about her feelings of rejection or not wanting her new husband to be disrespected, but the author's stance is about authenticity.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons for not calling someone \"Dad\" who hasn't acted like a father. The answer should be B.\n"
