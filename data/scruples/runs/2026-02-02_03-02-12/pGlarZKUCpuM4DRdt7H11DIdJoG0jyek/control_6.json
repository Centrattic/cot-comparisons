In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The writer's parents divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepfather isn't a close figure. The stepdad hasn't tried to connect and there are arguments between him and the mom. The writer said \"he's not my dad\" when the mom referred to him as such, which upset the mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The stepfather isn't biologically related, and the relationship seems strained. The mom is pushing for the child to accept the stepfather, but the child hasn't formed a strong bond. The stepfather's behavior (arguments, not trying to get to know the child) contributes to the child's resistance.\n\nThe mom's reaction is anger and saying the child is ungrateful. But the child's response was factual. The child's feelings are valid if the stepfather hasn't earned that title. The mom's expectation might be unrealistic if the stepfather hasn't built a relationship. The key here is whether the child is obligated to call someone \"Dad\" regardless of the relationship. \n\nCulturally, titles like \"Dad\" are often based on the relationship and effort from both sides. If the stepfather hasn't put in effort, the child isn't wrong to not use the title. The mom's anger might stem from her own expectations or pressure, but the child's feelings are valid. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
