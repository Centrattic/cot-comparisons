  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not wanting to call my stepfather \"Dad\"?\nSo hear me out. In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's mom remarried, and they don't like the stepfather. The mom called him \"your father,\" and the author said, \"He's not my dad,\" which upset the mom. The mom is now angry, saying the author is ungrateful and hasn't accepted him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author lives with their mom and stepdad. The stepdad hasn't really tried to connect, and there are arguments between the mom and stepdad. The author's reaction was a factual statement, not angry. The mom got angry and hasn't spoken to the author since.\n\nIn these situations, it's important to look at both sides. The mom might feel that after two years, the author should be more accepting, especially since they live together. But the author has valid reasons for not wanting to call him dad\u2014lack of connection, arguments, and a strained relationship.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might not feel comfortable using a term that implies a closer relationship than exists. The mom's anger could be because she wants the stepdad to be accepted, maybe to maintain appearances or feel that the author should respect the marriage.\n\nHowever, the author's response was straightforward and not hostile. They didn't lash out, just stated a fact. The mom's reaction seems more about her own feelings about the situation rather than the author's actual statement. The stepdad's behavior also plays a role here\u2014if he hasn't made an effort, the author's reluctance makes sense.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have reasons for their stance, and their response was neutral. The mom's anger might stem from her own expectations or pressures. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
