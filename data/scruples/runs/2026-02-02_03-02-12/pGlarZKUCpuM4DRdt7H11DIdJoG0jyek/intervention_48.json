In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The story is about a divorce and remarriage. The mom is now married to someone the author doesn't really get along with. The stepdad hasn't tried to connect much, and there's a lot of arguing between them and the mom. The author's mom called the stepdad \"your father,\" which made the author uncomfortable, so they said, \"he's not my dad,\" not angrily but factually. The mom got upset, called them ungrateful, and hasn't spoken to them since. The author wants to know if they're the asshole (AITA) here.\n\nFirst, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to agree or disagree based on the situation. Let's break it down. The stepdad and mom recently got married, about two years ago. The author lives with the mom but isn't close to the stepdad. They argue a lot, and the author finds the stepdad unpleasant. The mom uses the term \"father,\" which is a title of relationship. The author's response was factual, stating that he's not their dad. The mom's reaction was anger, saying the author is ungrateful and hasn't accepted him.\n\nSo, the key points here are the use of the term \"Dad\" or \"father\" and the mother's reaction. The author is probably uncomfortable with the idea of calling the stepdad \"Dad\" because they don't have a close relationship. The mom might be trying to include the stepdad as a new father figure, but the author isn't ready for that. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong: the author's statement was a fact. If the stepdad isn't their biological father, then technically he's not \"Dad.\" The mom might be using a term that she expects the author to use for the stepdad, but the author is resisting that. The question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting to use that term. \n\nCulturally, some people use \"Dad\" for stepparents, others don't. It's a personal choice. The author's issue isn't with the term itself but with the relationship dynamics. The stepdad hasn't tried to connect, and their interactions are tense. So the author's discomfort is understandable. The mom's reaction seems harsh, especially since the author didn't say it angrily. \n\nThe user is right to think the author isn't in the wrong. The author's response is a factual statement of their relationship. The mom's anger is misplaced if the author isn't trying to be disrespectful but is just stating the truth as they see it. So answer B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
