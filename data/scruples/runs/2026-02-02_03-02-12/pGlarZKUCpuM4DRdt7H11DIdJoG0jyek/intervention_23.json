In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation is that the parents are divorced, the mother remarried, and the stepfather doesn't have a good relationship with the child. The mother called him \"your father,\" and the child said he's not my dad. The mother got angry and hasn't spoken to the child since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The child's right to feel comfortable with familial terms. The stepfather hasn't tried to bond, there are arguments, and the child has a strained relationship. The mother is pushing for the child to accept the stepfather as a father figure, but the child isn't there yet. \n\nLegally, the stepfather isn't the biological father, so the term \"Dad\" might not be appropriate. Emotionally, the child might feel that using \"Dad\" implies a closer relationship than exists. The mother's reaction seems to be about wanting the child to accept the stepfather, but the child is justified in not forcing a familial title if the relationship isn't there. \n\nThe mother's anger might stem from feeling that the child is rejecting her new partner, but the child's feelings are valid. The stepfather's behavior (not trying to get to know the child, arguments) contributes to the child's discomfort. So the author isn't wrong for not wanting to call him \"Dad.\" The answer is B.\n"
