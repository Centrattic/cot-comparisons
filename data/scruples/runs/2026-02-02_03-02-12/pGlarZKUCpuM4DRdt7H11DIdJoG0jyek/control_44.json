In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation is that the author's parents divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepdad isn't very close with the author. The mom called him \"father,\" and the author objected, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author isn't the one who forced the relationship. The stepdad hasn't made much effort to connect, and there are arguments between him and the mom. The author's response was factual, not angry. The mom's reaction seems harsh, labeling the author as ungrateful. \n\nIn many cases, children aren't required to adopt new familial titles if they don't feel comfortable. The stepdad isn't a biological parent, so the author's reluctance makes sense. The mom might be pushing for a more unified front, but the author's feelings are valid given the stepdad's behavior and their strained relationship. \n\nThe key points are the lack of effort from the stepdad, the existing tension, and the author's non-confrontational statement. The mom's anger might stem from feeling rejected, but the author isn't at fault for not accepting someone who hasn't earned that title. So, the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
