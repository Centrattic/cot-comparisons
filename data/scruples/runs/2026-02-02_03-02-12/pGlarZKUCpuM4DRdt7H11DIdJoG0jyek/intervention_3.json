In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The person explains that their parents divorced, their mom remarried, and they don't have a good relationship with the stepdad. He's okay but hasn't tried to get to know them, and there's a lot of arguing between him and the mom. When the mom calls him \"your father,\" the person responds that he's not their dad. The mom got angry, called them ungrateful, and hasn't spoken to them since.\n\nHmm. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. From the author's perspective, they feel that the stepfather isn't a father figure, given the lack of connection and the arguments. They might feel it's important to maintain their relationship with their biological father, even if he's not present. On the other hand, the mom might feel that the stepfather is part of their new family and deserves respect by being called \"father.\" \n\nBut the stepfather isn't their biological father. The author's mom is the one who wants them to refer to him as \"father,\" which could be a way to legitimize the relationship. However, if the stepfather hasn't built a bond and they have a strained relationship, it's understandable that the author doesn't want to call him \"Dad.\" \n\nThe key points are the lack of effort from the stepfather, the existing tension, and the fact that the author is matter-of-factly stating their position without anger. The mom's reaction is emotional, which might indicate her own feelings of rejection or insecurity. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a sensitive family matter. The author isn't in the wrong for not calling him \"Dad\" because they have valid reasons. The mom's reaction is harsh, but the author isn't obligated to use a title they don't feel comfortable with. So, the answer is B.\n"
