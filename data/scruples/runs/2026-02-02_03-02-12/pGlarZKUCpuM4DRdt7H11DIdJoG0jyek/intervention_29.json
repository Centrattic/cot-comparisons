In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" So, the situation is that after the parents' divorce and remarriage, the stepdad hasn't really connected with the kid. They argue a lot, and the stepdad isn't nice. When the mom calls him \"your father,\" the kid says he's not their dad, leading to the mom getting angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The stepfather is not the biological father, so the kid not wanting to call him \"Dad\" makes sense if there's no real relationship. The mom might be pushing for a closer relationship, but the kid isn't there yet. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to confirm.\n\nThe key points are: the stepdad isn't trying to bond, there are arguments, and the kid's response was factual. The mom might feel hurt because the kid isn't accepting her new husband. But is the kid in the wrong? Well, the kid's response was factual and not hostile. The mom's anger could be her own issue, maybe projecting her feelings onto the kid. The kid's right to set boundaries, especially if the stepdad isn't a positive figure. So, probably the kid isn't wrong. Answer B.\n"
