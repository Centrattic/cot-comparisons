In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation involves a divorce, remarriage, and some tension between the stepfather and the child.\n\nFirst, the stepfather isn't being very nice or making an effort to connect, and there are arguments between him and the mother. The child's mom called the stepfather \"your father,\" which upset the child. The child said, \"He's not my dad,\" which the mom took as ungrateful. Now the mom hasn't spoken to the child since.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The child's feelings are valid if the stepfather hasn't earned the title \"Dad.\" Titles like that usually come from a relationship built on mutual respect and closeness. If the stepfather isn't part of the child's life meaningfully, the child isn't obligated to call him that. The mom might feel the child should show respect regardless, but the child has rights to their own feelings. However, the child's response was factual, not malicious. The mom's reaction of anger and cutting off communication seems harsh. So, the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for their feelings, but maybe could have approached it more sensitively. However, the core issue is the stepfather's lack of engagement, so the author's stance is justified. Answer B.\n"
