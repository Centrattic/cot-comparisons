In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The parents divorced, the mom remarried two years ago. The stepdad isn't close to the author, they argue with each other, and the stepdad hasn't tried to get to know the author. The mom calls the stepdad \"your father,\" and the author responds that he's not their dad. The mom gets angry and stops talking to the author.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate if the author is at fault here. Let's consider the key points. The author has a valid reason not to call the stepdad Dad if there's no genuine father-son relationship. The stepdad hasn't made an effort to build that relationship, and their interactions have been negative. The mom's reaction seems harsh\u2014calling the author ungrateful and cutting off communication. \n\nIn many cases, family dynamics can be complex. The title of a parent can be significant, but it's also personal. If the stepdad isn't acting like a father figure, forcing the title might not be fair. The author's response was factual and not angry, just stating the truth as they see it. The mother's anger seems disproportionate if the stepdad isn't fulfilling the role. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should make an effort for the mother's sake, but the quality of the relationship matters. If the stepdad isn't invested, the author isn't obligated to adopt the title. The mother's reaction could be the real issue here\u2014expecting the child to accept a stepfather who isn't close or supportive. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They have legitimate reasons for not using the title, and the mother's response is more concerning. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
