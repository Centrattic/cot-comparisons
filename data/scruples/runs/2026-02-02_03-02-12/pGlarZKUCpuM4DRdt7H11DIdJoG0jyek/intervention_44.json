In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation is that the parents divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepdad isn't very close with the kid. The kid and stepdad argue, the mom calls him \"your father,\" and the kid says he's not their dad, leading to the mom being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and emotional aspects. Legally, the stepfather isn't the biological father, so the kid isn't obligated to call him \"Dad.\" However, family dynamics can be complex. The mom might feel that using the term is a step towards accepting the new family structure. The kid's resistance could stem from genuine feelings of not feeling a paternal bond, especially if the stepdad hasn't made efforts to connect.\n\nThe mother's reaction\u2014getting angry and calling the kid ungrateful\u2014might indicate her frustration. She might be trying to enforce a new family norm, feeling that the kid isn't respecting her choice or the marriage. But the kid's stance is based on their personal experiences and lack of connection. Is the kid being disrespectful? It depends on context. If the kid is firm but not hostile, it's more about personal feelings than disrespect.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people often choose how they address family members, especially step-relations. There's no universal rule requiring someone to use a certain title. The key factors here are the kid's feelings and the mom's expectations. If the mom expected the kid to adopt the term without considering their feelings, that's a problem. But the kid is just stating their truth. The stepdad's behavior (not trying to get to know the kid, arguments) also plays a role in the kid's reluctance.\n\nSo, the kid isn't in the wrong for expressing their true feelings. The mom's reaction is harsh, possibly because she's projecting her own expectations onto the child. The kid isn't obligated to use a term that doesn't feel right to them. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
