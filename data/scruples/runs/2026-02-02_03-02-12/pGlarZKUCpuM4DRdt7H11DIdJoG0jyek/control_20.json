  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not wanting to call my stepfather \"Dad\"?\nSo hear me out. In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The main issue is that the author refuses to call their stepfather \"Dad,\" and their mother is upset about it. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's perspective: their parents divorced, the mom remarried. The stepfather isn't very involved, they argue a lot, and the author has had conflicts with him. When the mom refers to him as \"your father,\" the author says, \"he's not my dad,\" which led to an argument. The author isn't angry but just stating a fact.\n\nOn the other side, the mom is upset, calling the author ungrateful and saying they haven't accepted the stepfather. She hasn't spoken to the author since. The question is whether the author is wrong here.\n\nHmm. Well, calling someone \"Dad\" is a personal choice. The stepfather isn't the biological father, so the author might not feel comfortable using that term. The mother might push for it to integrate the stepfather into the family dynamic, but if the relationship isn't positive, that could be a problem. The author's reasoning seems valid\u2014they have a strained relationship and the stepfather hasn't made an effort. \n\nBut the mom's reaction is strong. She might feel that the author is disrespecting her marriage or not respecting her choice. However, the author hasn't necessarily done anything wrong by expressing their feelings. It's about personal boundaries and comfort. The author isn't obligated to call someone \"Dad\" if they don't want to, especially given the circumstances. The mother's anger might be more about her own feelings rather than the author's actions being wrong. \n\nI think the key points here are the strained relationship between the author and stepfather, the lack of effort from the stepfather to connect, and the author's honest feelings. The mother's reaction seems harsh, but the author isn't in the wrong for standing by their feelings. So the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
