In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The stepfather and mother have been married for two years, but there are issues like arguments and the stepfather not trying to get to know the kid. The kid called out the stepfather for not being their dad, and the mom got angry.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the kid's feelings versus the mother's expectations. The kid feels the stepfather isn't trying and there's conflict. The mother is upset that the kid isn't accepting him as a father figure. \n\nIs the kid wrong for not wanting to call him Dad? Well, the stepfather hasn't built a relationship, and there are ongoing issues between the parents. The kid's statement was factual\u2014biologically, he's not the father. The mom might want the kid to be more accepting, but the kid's feelings are valid if the stepfather hasn't earned that title. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people usually consider both sides. The mother's reaction is harsh, calling the kid ungrateful. The kid's response was matter-of-fact. It seems like the kid isn't in the wrong here. They have a right to feel that way if the stepfather hasn't been a positive presence. The mother's anger might be misplaced, expecting immediate acceptance without the stepfather putting in effort. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
