In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The question is about whether it's acceptable to refuse to call the stepfather \"Dad.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The parents are divorced, the mother remarried two years ago. The stepdad isn't close to the author, they argue a lot, and the mom refers to him as \"Dad,\" which the author refuses. The mom got angry and hasn't spoken to the author since.\n\nThe key points here are the dynamics between the family members. The stepfather hasn't tried to bond with the author, there's tension in the household, and the mother is pushing for the author to call him \"Dad.\" The author's response was a factual statement saying he's not their dad, not an angry outburst. \n\nNow, considering social norms, it's common for step-parents to prefer being called by their title (Dad/Mom), but it's not a requirement. The author's refusal can be seen as a reflection of their actual relationship, which isn't close. The mother's reaction might stem from frustration, feeling that the author isn't respecting the new family structure. But is the author wrong for not wanting to use that term?\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's stance is unjustified. Since the stepfather isn't acting in a way that would make the author feel connected, the author isn't in the wrong. The mother's anger might be misplaced, as the author is honest about the relationship. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
