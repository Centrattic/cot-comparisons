In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation involves a divorce and remarriage, with the stepfather not being close to the author and their mom's arguments.\n\nFirst, the author's mom refers to the stepdad as \"your father,\" which makes the author uncomfortable. The author responds with \"he's not my dad,\" which the mom takes as ungrateful. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know if I agree.\n\nI need to consider family dynamics. The stepfather hasn't tried to bond with the author and there's tension between mom and stepdad. The author's resistance to calling him \"Dad\" seems reasonable because they don't have a paternal relationship. The mother's reaction of being angry and calling the author ungrateful might stem from wanting the child to accept the new partner, but if the stepfather isn't engaging, the author's stance is valid.\n\nThe key here is whether the author has a genuine relationship with the stepfather. Since the stepfather hasn't made an effort and there are arguments, the author isn't obligated to call him \"Dad.\" The mother's reaction might be unjustified because the author's refusal is based on the lack of a real father-son/daughter bond. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
