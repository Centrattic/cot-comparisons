In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe person's parents got divorced, and their mom remarried. The stepfather they have now isn't really close to the author. The stepdad doesn't make an effort to get to know them, they argue a lot, and when they do interact, it's often confrontational. The mom recently called the stepdad \"your father\" and the author responded with \"he's not my dad,\" which made the mom angry, calling the author ungrateful and saying they never accepted him. Now they're not speaking.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let me think about the dynamics here. The author is not required to call someone \"Dad\" if they don't feel emotionally connected. The stepfather isn't their biological father, so maybe the mom expects a term of endearment because they live together as a family. However, if the stepfather hasn't made an effort to build a relationship, it's reasonable for the author to not want to use that title. \n\nBut the mom is upset because she wants the author to accept her new husband as a father figure. The key here is whether the author's refusal is disrespectful or not. If the stepfather isn't acting like a father, then the author isn't being unreasonable. The mom's reaction might stem from her desire for the author to be more accepting, but if the stepfather isn't fulfilling that role, the author's stance is valid. \n\nAlso, the stepfather and mom argue a lot, which could create tension. The author's statement \"he's not my dad\" is factual in the sense that he isn't their biological father and hasn't acted as a father figure. The mom's anger might be because she feels the author is rejecting her marriage, but the author's feelings are legitimate if the stepfather hasn't tried to connect. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, people often expect stepchildren to call them by a title like \"Dad,\" but that's not a universal rule. It's more about the relationship. If there's no bond, it's okay to not use that term. The stepfather's lack of effort is a valid reason for the author's resistance. \n\nSo the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to call him \"Dad,\" especially if the stepfather hasn't made an effort. The mom's anger might be misplaced because the issue isn't just about the title but the underlying issues in the stepfather's relationship with the author. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
