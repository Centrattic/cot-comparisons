In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" \n\nFirst, the situation: the parents divorced, mom remarried. The stepfather hasn't tried to get to know the kid, they argue a lot together and with the kid. The mom calls the stepfather \"your father,\" and the kid says \"he's not my dad.\" The mom got angry, called the kid ungrateful and never accepted him, and hasn't spoken to the kid since.\n\nThe key points here are the stepfather's behavior. The user mentions that the stepfather is \"OK but never really tried to get to know me\" and they argue a lot. Also, the stepfather hasn't been nice. So, the kid's resistance to calling him \"Dad\" seems rooted in the lack of a genuine relationship or positive interactions. \n\nThe mom's reaction is to be angry and accuse the kid of being ungrateful. That part is tricky. The mom might feel the kid isn't respecting the new family structure, but if the stepfather hasn't earned the title through building a relationship, the kid isn't obligated to use it. The kid's statement was factual and not angry. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the stepfather's lack of effort and the mom's pushing for a title without the foundation might both play roles. The kid isn't in the wrong for not wanting to use a title that doesn't reflect their relationship. The mom's anger seems misplaced if the stepfather hasn't actively built a bond. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
