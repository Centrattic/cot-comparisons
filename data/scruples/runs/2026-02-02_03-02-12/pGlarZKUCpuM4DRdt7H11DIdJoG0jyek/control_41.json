In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the parents are divorced, and the mom is now remarried. The stepfather is described as \"OK but never really tried to get to know me,\" and there's a lot of arguing between him and the mom. The stepdad and the author have had arguments, and he's not very nice. The key point is when the mom refers to him as \"your father,\" the author says, \"he's not my dad,\" which made the mom angry, calling them ungrateful and not accepting the stepdad.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for not calling him Dad. From a moral standpoint, family dynamics can be complex. The author isn't obligated to call someone a title if they feel uncomfortable, especially if the relationship is strained. The stepdad hasn't made an effort to connect, and their interactions are negative. The mom's reaction might stem from feeling that the author isn't honoring her new partner, but the author's stance is based on their actual relationship and feelings.\n\nHowever, in some family structures, there's an expectation to show respect or use certain titles even if the relationship isn't ideal. But the author's statement was matter-of-fact, not hostile. The stepdad isn't their biological father, and the author isn't in a close, positive relationship with him. The mom's anger might be more about her own expectations or the stepdad's feelings rather than the author's right to their own feelings.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. They have a valid reason not to use the title given the circumstances. It's about personal boundaries and genuine feelings. The mom's reaction could be seen as overstepping, but the author isn't obligated to pretend a closer relationship than exists. So, answer B: the author is not in the wrong.\n"
