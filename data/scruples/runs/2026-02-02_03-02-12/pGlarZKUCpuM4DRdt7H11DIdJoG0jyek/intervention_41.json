In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The parents are divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepdad hasn't really tried to get to know the kid. They argue a lot, and the stepdad hasn't been nice. The mom called him \"your father,\" which upset the kid, leading to a fight where the mom called the kid ungrateful and hasn't spoken to them since.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nHmm. Legally, a stepfather isn't a legal parent, so the title \"Dad\" is more about emotional acceptance. The kid has a strained relationship, so refusing to use the title might be their way of setting boundaries. The mom might feel hurt that the kid isn't accepting her new husband, but it's the kid's choice how they refer to someone. The stepdad isn't their biological father, so it's reasonable the kid doesn't want to call him Dad. The mom's reaction seems harsh, but the kid's statement was a fact. \n\nI think the kid isn't in the wrong here. They have the right to choose how they address their stepfather, especially if the relationship is problematic. The mom's anger might be more about her own feelings than the kid's right to use a title they're uncomfortable with. So the answer should be B.\n"
