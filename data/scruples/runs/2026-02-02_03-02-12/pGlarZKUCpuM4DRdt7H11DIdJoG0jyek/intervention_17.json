In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's parents got divorced, and the mom remarried two years ago. The stepdad isn't very close with the author, they argue a lot, and he hasn't really tried to get to know them. The mom refers to him as \"your father,\" but the author objects, saying he's not their dad. The mom got angry and hasn't spoken to the author since.\n\nSo why is this a problem? Well, in many families, after a parent remarries, there's an expectation that the child might adopt a new title for the step-parent. But the author feels it's not appropriate because the relationship isn't there. The mom is upset because she wants the author to accept the stepdad as a father figure, but the author resists because of the lack of a positive relationship.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms. In some cultures, addressing step-parents as \"Dad\" or \"Mom\" is expected, but in others, it's more flexible. The key here is whether the author's refusal is disrespectful. The author states they just said \"he's not my dad\" in a matter-of-fact way, not angrily. The mother, however, perceives this as ungrateful and a refusal to accept the stepdad.\n\nThe stepfather's behavior is also a factor. If he hasn't made efforts to build a relationship, the author's hesitation makes sense. The author isn't obligated to call someone \"Dad\" if there's no genuine paternal relationship. The mother's anger might stem from her own expectations and desire for a cohesive family image, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong for not complying.\n\nAlso, considering the dynamics where the stepdad and mom argue, the stepdad's behavior might contribute to the author's discomfort. The author's response was a factual statement, not a disrespectful one. The mother's reaction could be overly emotional, especially if she's projecting her own feelings about the marriage onto the situation.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they're not required to adopt a title that doesn't reflect their actual relationship with the stepfather. The mother's reaction seems harsh, and the stepfather's lack of effort to connect is a significant factor here.\n"
