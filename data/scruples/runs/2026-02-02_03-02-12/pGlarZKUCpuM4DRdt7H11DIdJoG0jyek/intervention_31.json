In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation is that the parents are divorced, and the mom remarried. The stepdad isn't close with the kid, argues a lot with the mom, and the kid refuses to call him \"Dad.\" The mom gets angry and says the kid is ungrateful and hasn't accepted him.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the dynamics here. The kid's relationship with the stepfather is strained. The stepdad hasn't made an effort to bond, and their interactions are argumentative. The mom is pressuring the kid to call him \"Dad,\" which the kid feels is inappropriate given their relationship. The mom's reaction is anger and cutting off communication.\n\nFrom the kid's perspective, they might feel that using \"Dad\" implies a level of closeness or acceptance that doesn't exist. It's about identity and respect. The mom is likely trying to integrate the stepdad into the family, maybe to validate the marriage or to show unity. But if the stepdad hasn't built a positive relationship with the kid, forcing the term could be hurtful.\n\nLegally or traditionally, maybe there's an expectation that stepchildren address stepparents with certain titles. But relationships are complex. The kid's feelings are valid if they don't feel a connection. The mom's anger might stem from feeling that the kid isn't respecting her new husband, but that's her perspective. The kid isn't wrong for not feeling that way. So, I think the answer is B\u2014no, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to their feelings without being labeled as ungrateful.\n"
