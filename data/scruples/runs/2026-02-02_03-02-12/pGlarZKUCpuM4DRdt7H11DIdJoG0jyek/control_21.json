In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The stepfather and the mother are remarried, but the stepfather hasn't really tried to get to know the kid, and they argue a lot. The kid says he's not a big fan, and when the mom called the stepfather \"your father,\" the kid responded with \"he's not my dad,\" which made the mom angry, leading to a cold shoulder.\n\nSo, the question is whether the kid was in the wrong. The mom is upset because the kid didn't accept her husband as a father figure. The kid's reasoning is that the stepfather hasn't made an effort, they get along poorly, and the stepfather isn't nice. \n\nI should consider the dynamics here. The kid's feelings matter. If the stepfather hasn't tried to build a relationship, it's reasonable for the kid to not feel connected. The mom might be pushing for the kid to accept the stepfather, but if the stepfather isn't fulfilling a fatherly role, the kid's resistance makes sense. \n\nHowever, maybe the mom feels that the title \"Dad\" is important for family unity. But the kid's response was factual, pointing out that the stepfather isn't his biological father. The mom's reaction seems harsh because of the kid's honesty. \n\nAlso, the stepfather and mom argue a lot, which adds to the kid's discomfort. The kid's statement wasn't aggressive; it was a matter-of-fact denial. The mom's anger might stem from feeling that the kid isn't respecting her new husband or trying to bond. But if the stepfather isn't a positive presence, the kid isn't obligated to adopt the title. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the person did something wrong. The kid didn't do anything malicious. He expressed his feelings truthfully. The mom's reaction is more about her expectations than the kid's actions. So the kid isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
