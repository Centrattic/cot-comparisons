In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person's parents divorced, and their mom remarried. The stepfather isn't close with the person, argues with the mom a lot, and the interactions are strained. When the mom refers to the stepdad as \"your father,\" the person objects by saying \"he's not my dad,\" which causes the mom to get angry and cut them off.\n\nNow, considering family dynamics. Calling someone \"Dad\" is a big thing. It's about recognition and emotional acceptance. The person might feel that the stepfather doesn't deserve that title because of the lack of connection and the negative environment. The mom, on the other hand, might feel that this refusal is disrespectful or ungrateful, especially since she's in a marriage with him.\n\nBut the key points here: The stepfather hasn't made efforts to bond with the person, their relationship is argumentative, and the mom is forcing the term \"father,\" which the person is uncomfortable with. The person didn't act out of anger but stated a fact. The mom's reaction seems harsh. \n\nIn many cultures, titles like \"Dad\" or \"Mom\" are deeply personal. If the stepfather hasn't earned that respect through his actions, the person has the right to refuse. The mom's anger might stem from feeling that her new spouse is being disrespected, but the person's stance is about their own feelings and the reality of their relationship. \n\nSo, the person isn't wrong for not wanting to use the term if they genuinely don't see him as a father figure. The mom's reaction is probably more about the situation than the actual words. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
