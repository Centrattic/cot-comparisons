In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation is that their parents got divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepfather isn't really close with them. The stepdad isn't making an effort to connect, they argue a lot, and when the mom refers to him as \"father,\" the person objects. The mom got angry and hasn't spoken to them since. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know if they are.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the feelings and perspectives of both the author and their mom. The author's resistance to calling the stepfather \"Dad\" seems to stem from not feeling a fatherly relationship. If the stepfather hasn't built a bond and there are frequent arguments, the author's discomfort is understandable. They might feel forced into a role that isn't genuine, which can be emotionally challenging.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom's reaction is also significant. She's probably feeling that the stepfather deserves respect as part of the family now, and the author's refusal might be seen as rejecting the new family structure. Her anger could come from feeling disrespected or from wanting her husband to be recognized as a parent.\n\nBut the key here is that the stepfather hasn't made an effort to connect. If someone isn't acting like a father figure, it's not fair to expect the child to call them \"Dad.\" The author's statement was factual\u2014they don't have a father-son/daughter relationship. The mom's anger might be more about her own feelings about the marriage or her expectations for the family dynamic, but the author isn't at fault for not feeling a connection they haven't developed.\n\nAlso, the stepfather's behavior (arguing a lot, not getting to know the child) contributes to the situation. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to use a title that doesn't feel right. They have the right to express their feelings, even if it upsets the mom. However, the mom's reaction might be a result of her own stress from the divorce and remarriage. But the main question is the author's right to not call him \"Dad,\" which seems justified given the circumstances. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
