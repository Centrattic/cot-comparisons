In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not calling their stepfather \"Dad.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parents divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepfather hasn't really connected with the kid. They argue a lot, and the kid is uncomfortable with the stepfather. When the mom refers to him as \"father,\" the kid objects, leading to tension.\n\nThe key points here are the kid's feelings and the mom's reaction. The kid feels the stepfather isn't a father figure due to lack of connection and negative interactions. The mom is upset because the kid isn't accepting the new family structure. \n\nI should consider cultural norms here. In many cases, calling a step-parent by their title (Dad/Mom) is expected, but it's not a universal rule. The kid's resistance might stem from genuine discomfort. The mom's anger could be because she wants the family to present unity, even if the reality isn't perfect. \n\nIs the kid in the wrong for not calling him \"Dad\"? Well, they have valid reasons for not feeling comfortable. They're not being disrespectful, just factual. The mom's reaction might be more about her own expectations than the kid's actual wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom's perspective is important. She's trying to integrate the stepfather into their lives, and the kid's refusal could be seen as a rejection of her new partner, which might hurt her. But the kid's feelings shouldn't be dismissed just because the mom wants unity. \n\nSo, balancing both sides: the kid isn't wrong for feeling the way they do. The mom's anger might be over the top, especially if she didn't consider the kid's perspective. The stepfather's behavior also plays a role\u2014since he hasn't tried to connect, the kid's reluctance makes sense. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They have legitimate reasons for their stance, and the mom's reaction might stem from her own expectations rather than the kid's actions being objectively wrong.\n"
