In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation is that the parents got divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepfather isn't really close with the kid. They argue a lot, and the mom called him \"your father,\" which the kid objected to.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The kid is living with the mom, and the stepfather is her new husband. The kid has had arguments with him and feels he doesn't try to get to know them. The mom got angry when the kid said he's not their dad. \n\nFrom the kid's perspective, they might feel that since the stepfather hasn't made an effort to build a relationship, it's not appropriate to call him \"Dad.\" The term \"Dad\" usually implies a father figure, and if the stepfather isn't acting like one, the kid might not see the need to use that title. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom might expect the kid to be polite and respectful, even if the relationship isn't close. She might feel that calling him \"Dad\" is a sign of acceptance and respect. But if the stepfather and the kid have a strained relationship, forcing that term could cause more tension.\n\nAlso, the stepfather wasn't the biological father, so the kid might not feel a natural connection. The term \"Dad\" can be emotionally charged, especially if it's replacing the previous biological father or if there's a history of conflict. The kid's response was matter-of-fact, not angry, which suggests they're not being disrespectful but just stating their feelings.\n\nThe mom's reaction might stem from feeling that the kid isn't respecting the new family structure. But if the stepfather isn't fulfilling the role of a father, the kid's refusal to use the title could be justified. It's important for parents to acknowledge their child's feelings and not force terms that don't feel right to the child. \n\nIn many cases, children have the right to choose how they refer to their stepparents, especially if the relationship isn't positive. The key here is whether the kid is being disrespectful versus just not wanting to use a term that doesn't fit their experience. Since the kid isn't angry but just stating a fact, it seems like they're not in the wrong. The mom might need to understand that her child's feelings are valid and that pushing for a title without a good relationship could be counterproductive.\n"
