In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" They provided a detailed situation where the stepfather isn't very involved, they argue a lot, and the writer's mom got upset when the writer said he's not their dad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The stepfather hasn't tried to get to know the writer, and there are frequent arguments. The writer isn't comfortable calling him \"Dad,\" which is a personal choice. But the mom is upset, calling the writer ungrateful and not accepting him. \n\nFrom a relational standpoint, the writer's feelings are valid. They might not feel a father-son/daughter bond, especially if the stepfather hasn't made an effort. The mom's reaction could be hurt because she wants the family unit to be harmonious. However, the writer's right to set boundaries and express discomfort is important. \n\nIn many cases, using a title like \"Dad\" is a choice and can be a sensitive issue. The writer isn't wrong for not wanting to use it, especially given the circumstances. The stepfather's lack of engagement and the conflicts contribute to the writer's stance. The mom's anger might stem from feeling that her new marriage isn't being respected, but the writer has a right to their feelings. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to their feelings and boundaries, even if it causes tension. The stepfather's behavior and the mom's expectations don't negate the writer's valid perspective.\n"
