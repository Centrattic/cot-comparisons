In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation involves a divorce, remarriage, and some tension between the stepfather and the child.\n\nFirst, the stepfather hasn't really tried to get to know the child, there are arguments between him and the mom, and their interactions have been mostly arguments. The child just states a fact when the mom refers to the stepdad as \"your father,\" saying \"he's not my dad.\" The mom got angry and accused the child of being ungrateful.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the stepfather isn't a positive figure in the child's life right now. The child's statement is factual and not angry, just a response to the mom's comment. The mom is upset, but is the child wrong for not calling him dad?\n\nWell, the child's feelings matter. If the stepfather hasn't built a relationship and the dynamic is strained, it's not unreasonable for the child to not feel comfortable with that title. The mom's anger might stem from her own expectations, but the child isn't obligated to adopt a title if they don't feel it's appropriate. The stepfather isn't a biological parent, so the child's refusal to use \"Dad\" could be seen as valid, given the circumstances. The mom might feel hurt or rejected, but the child's right to their own feelings is important. So the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
