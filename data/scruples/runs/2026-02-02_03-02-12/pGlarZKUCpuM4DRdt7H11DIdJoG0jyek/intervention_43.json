In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the parents are divorced, and the mom is remarried. The stepfather isn't really trying to get to know the author. They argue a lot, and their interactions are tense. The mom refers to the stepdad as \"your father,\" which makes the author uncomfortable. The author responds with \"he's not my dad,\" which was matter-of-fact, but the mom got angry, called them ungrateful, and hasn't spoken to them since.\n\nSo, the author is saying they have legitimate reasons not to use the term \"Dad\" for their stepfather. The mom is upset because the author isn't accepting him, but the author feels the stepfather isn't a father figure. \n\nI need to consider if the author is wrong. The key points are the stepfather not being involved, arguments in the household, and the author's refusal to use the term. The mom is pushing for acceptance, but maybe the author is justified in not feeling that way. It's about respect and how people feel about family roles. If the stepfather isn't fulfilling a father role, the author's stance makes sense. The mom's anger might stem from wanting the family to feel united, but the author isn't in the wrong for not faking a relationship they don't have. So, probably the answer is B.\n"
