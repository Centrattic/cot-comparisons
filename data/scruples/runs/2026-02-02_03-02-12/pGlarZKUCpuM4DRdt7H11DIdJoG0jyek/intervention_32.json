In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not calling their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation is that the parents divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepfather isn't very close with the child. The mom called him \"your father,\" which made the kid say he's not their dad, and the mom got angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The stepfather and the child have a strained relationship. The stepfather hasn't made an effort to connect and they argue a lot. The child is just stating a fact that the stepfather isn't their biological father. The mom is upset because the child isn't accepting the stepfather as a father figure.\n\nLegally, the stepfather isn't the biological father, so the child isn't obligated to call him \"Dad.\" Emotionally, it's about respect and familial bonds. The child might not feel a connection, so refusing the title isn't necessarily disrespectful. The mom might want the child to accept the stepfather for the sake of family unity, but if the stepfather hasn't tried to build a relationship, the child's reluctance is understandable.\n\nThe key points are: the child's relationship with the stepfather is strained, the stepfather hasn't made efforts, and the child is just stating the truth when saying he's not their dad. The mom's anger stems from wanting the child to accept the stepfather, but the child's stance is based on reality and their experiences. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
