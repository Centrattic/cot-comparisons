In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation involves a recent remarriage after a divorce, and the stepfather isn't close with the child, there are arguments between the parents, and the child doesn't feel comfortable referring to the stepfather as \"father.\" The mom got upset when the child said the stepdad isn't their dad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The stepfather and the child haven't built a strong relationship. The stepfather hasn't made efforts to connect, and there are arguments. The child's reaction is a factual statement based on their experience, not an emotional outburst. The mother's reaction is about the child not accepting her new husband, but if the relationship isn't there, the child's resistance makes sense.\n\nLegally and traditionally, in some cultures, step-parents might be expected to take on a parental role, but emotionally and socially, that's different. The child's feelings are valid if they don't feel a connection. The mother's anger might stem from wanting the child to accept her new spouse, but forcing a label without an actual relationship can be hurtful. The child isn't wrong for expressing their true feelings, even if it upsets the mother. The key here is whether the child is being disrespectful versus honest. The child's statement was factual and not aggressive, so it's about their genuine experience. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
