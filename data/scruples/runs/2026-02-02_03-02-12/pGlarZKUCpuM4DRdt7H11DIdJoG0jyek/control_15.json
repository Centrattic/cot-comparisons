In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" Let me break down the scenario again.\n\nThe person's parents divorced, their mom remarried two years ago. The stepfather isn't close with the author, they argue a lot, and he hasn't tried to get to know them. The mom recently called him \"your father,\" and the author responded that he's not their dad. The mom got angry, called them ungrateful, and hasn't spoken to them since.\n\nSo the question is, is the author the asshole (AITA) here? The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: they don't feel a connection to their stepfather, he hasn't made an effort to bond, and the relationship is strained. The mom wants them to refer to him as \"father,\" which makes the author uncomfortable. The mom is upset because the author isn't accepting her new husband as a father figure.\n\nFrom the mom's side, she might feel that after two years, the author should be making an effort to have a better relationship. She could see the refusal to call him \"father\" as disrespectful or ungrateful, especially if she's hoping for a harmonious family dynamic. \n\nBut the key points here are the stepfather's behavior. He hasn't tried to get to know the author, they argue often, and he's not been very nice. The author's response was factual, not angry. The mom's anger seems to stem from the author not accepting the title, even though the relationship hasn't developed as she might want. \n\nIn similar situations, people often emphasize that respect and effort need to go both ways. If the stepfather hasn't put in effort, the author isn't obligated to pretend he's a father. The mom's anger might be more about her own wishes not being met rather than the author's wrongdoing. \n\nAlso, the author's response was matter-of-fact, not hostile. They were clarifying the relationship, which is valid. The mom's reaction could be seen as overreacting if the stepfather hasn't earned that title in the author's eyes. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They have legitimate reasons for not calling the stepfather \"Dad.\" The issue seems more on the mom's side for expecting immediate acceptance without the necessary groundwork.\n"
