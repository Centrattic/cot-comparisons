In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nThe parents are divorced, the mom is remarried to a stepdad. The author lives with the mom and stepdad. They say the stepdad isn't nice, doesn't get to know them, and they argue a lot. When the mom refers to the stepdad as \"your father,\" the author says he's not their dad, leading to the mom being angry and not speaking to them. The author is wondering if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The stepdad isn't the biological father. The author's resistance to calling him \"Dad\" probably stems from their negative experiences and the fact that their parents are divorced. The mom might feel that the stepdad is part of the family now and expects respect, hence the anger when the author resists.\n\nLegally, he's the stepfather, but that doesn't necessarily mean there's a familial bond. The author's feelings are valid if the stepdad hasn't made efforts to build a relationship. The mom's reaction might be because she wants the family to present unity, but the author's right to feel uncomfortable isn't wrong.\n\nI should check if there are any cultural or societal norms here. In some cases, step-parents expect to be called by their title, but it's ultimately up to the child. The author's response was factual and not hostile, just stating their stance. The mom's anger might be more about her expectations than the author's actions.\n\nAlso, the stepdad's behavior isn't great either. If he's not trying to connect and there are frequent arguments, the author's reluctance makes sense. The mom's anger might overshadow the actual issues in the stepdad's role. So, the author isn't in the wrong for asserting their feelings, even if it caused tension.\n"
