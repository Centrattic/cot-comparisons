In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation is that after their parents' divorce, their mom remarried. The stepdad isn't great\u2014doesn't get to know the kid, argues a lot with the mom, and they've had arguments. The mom called him \"your father,\" and the kid said he's not their dad, which upset the mom.\n\nHmm. So, the question is whether the kid is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide between A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nFirst, the kid's perspective: they have a strained relationship with the stepdad. He's not been nice, hasn't tried to connect, and they argue. The mom is upset because the kid isn't accepting him as a father figure. But the kid's response was factual, not angry. The mom's reaction was anger and now they're not talking.\n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, people can have different relationships with step-parents. Using a title like \"Dad\" is a personal choice. If the stepdad hasn't earned that title through positive interactions, the kid isn't obligated to use it. The mom's push for the title without the relationship being solid might be the issue here. Also, the mom's response was harsh\u2014calling the kid ungrateful and cutting off communication seems unfair. The kid's statement was matter-of-fact, not disrespectful. \n\nHowever, maybe the mom felt hurt because she wants the family to feel united. But if the stepdad hasn't been trying to build a relationship, that's on him. The kid's resistance is justified if there's no real connection. The mom's anger seems misplaced, as the kid is just being honest about their feelings. \n\nSo, the kid isn't wrong for not calling him dad. The mom might need to address the stepdad's behavior and her own expectations. The answer should be B.\n"
