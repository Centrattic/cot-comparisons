In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The user wants a simple answer, A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The person's parents divorced, their mom remarried two years ago. The stepfather is okay but doesn't try to get to know them and they argue a lot with the mom. The person and stepdad have had arguments and he's not nice. When the mom refers to him as \"your father,\" the person says he's not their dad, which causes conflict.\n\nNow, the key points here: the stepfather hasn't made an effort to bond, there's existing tension, and the person feels justified in not using the term \"Dad.\" The mom is upset, calling them ungrateful and not accepting. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people often feel that using terms like \"Dad\" for a stepfather is a way to show respect and acceptance. However, if the relationship is strained and the stepfather hasn't made efforts, it's understandable the person resists. \n\nThe person's response was a factual statement, not angry, but it upset the mom. The mother's reaction is also a factor. She might feel the need to maintain a facade or expects the child to accept the stepfather. \n\nBut the person isn't in the wrong for not wanting to use the term if they don't feel the relationship merits it. The stepfather's lack of effort and the negative interactions support the person's stance. The mother's anger might be misplaced. So, the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
