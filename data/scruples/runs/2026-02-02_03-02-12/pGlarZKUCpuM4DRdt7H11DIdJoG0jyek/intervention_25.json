In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The scenario is that the parents divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepfather hasn't really tried to connect. The stepdad and mom argue a lot, and when the mom refers to him as \"father,\" the author says he's not their dad. The mom got upset and hasn't spoken to them since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's stepfather is not their biological father. The mom is trying to integrate him into the family, maybe expecting the child to accept him as a father figure. The author's resistance could stem from genuine discomfort or negative experiences with the stepfather. The key points are whether the author has a valid reason for not wanting to call him \"Dad\" and if the mother's reaction is justified.\n\nThe stepfather hasn't made an effort to get to know the author, there are arguments, and interactions have been tense. The author's statement \"he's not my dad\" is a factual statement since he's not biologically related. The mother's anger might come from feeling rejected or that the author is ungrateful for the marriage. But if the stepfather isn't a positive presence, the author isn't obligated to accept him. The mother's expectation might be unrealistic if the stepfather hasn't earned that role.\n\nIn such cases, it's about respect and personal boundaries. The author isn't wrong for not feeling comfortable with a title that implies a closer relationship than exists. The mother's reaction seems harsh without understanding the underlying issues. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
