In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad\" after their parents' divorce and the mother's remarriage.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The parents divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepfather isn't very close with the author. They argue a lot, and the stepfather hasn't made an effort to get to know the author. When the mom refers to him as \"your father,\" the author responds with \"he's not my dad,\" which upsets the mom, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's feelings towards the stepfather, the stepfather's behavior, and the mother's reaction. The author doesn't have a good relationship with the stepfather, which is understandable given the lack of effort and frequent arguments. The term \"Dad\" is a personal and emotional title, so it's reasonable that the author might feel uncomfortable using it. \n\nThe mother is upset because she wanted the author to accept her husband as a father figure. However, acceptance shouldn't be forced if there's no genuine connection. The stepfather isn't the author's biological father, so the author isn't obligated to call him that. The mom calling the author ungrateful might be a misunderstanding. The author isn't refusing out of ingratitude but because of a lack of relationship.\n\nIn terms of social norms, some people use the term \"Dad\" for stepfathers, but others don't, especially if the relationship isn't close. The author's response was factual and not confrontational, just stating that he's not their dad. The mother's anger might stem from feeling that the author is rejecting her new relationship or not respecting her choice. However, the author's right to feel comfortable with their own terms should be considered. \n\nPossible angles to consider: family dynamics, the importance of personal feelings, the role of the stepfather in the author's life, and whether the mother is overstepping by expecting a title that the author isn't comfortable with. Also, whether the author's statement was rude. The author said it matter-of-factly, not angrily, so it's more about expressing their truth rather than being disrespectful.\n\nI don't see anything in the post that suggests the author is being unreasonable. The stepfather's behavior doesn't indicate he's worthy of the title, and the author has a right to set boundaries regarding familial terms. The mother's reaction might be harsh, but the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to use the term \"Dad\" in this context. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
