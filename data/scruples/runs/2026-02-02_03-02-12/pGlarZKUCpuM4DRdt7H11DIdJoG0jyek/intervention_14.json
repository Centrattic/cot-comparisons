In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation is that the parents divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepfather isn't really close with the kid. They argue a lot, and the mom got upset when the kid said he's not their dad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The kid is living with their mom, but the stepfather isn't really making an effort to connect. The kid has had arguments with him and doesn't feel close. The mom used the term \"your father,\" which the kid corrected, saying he's not their dad. The mom got angry and hasn't spoken to the kid since.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I should think about whether calling someone \"Dad\" is a requirement. Legally, maybe the stepfather isn't a father, but socially, sometimes people adopt new family titles. However, it's a personal choice. The kid might feel uncomfortable using the term if there's no real fatherly relationship. The mom's reaction seems harsh because she might feel the kid is rejecting her new marriage or being ungrateful.\n\nBut the stepfather isn't trying to build a relationship, so the kid's resistance makes sense. The mom's anger could be because she wants the kid to accept him, but if the stepfather isn't acting like a father figure, the kid has valid reasons not to use the term. It's about mutual respect and the reality of their relationship. The kid isn't wrong for not wanting to use a title that doesn't feel accurate to them.\n"
