In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation is that after their parents' divorce and remarriage, the stepfather hasn't really connected with the author and they've had arguments. The mom called him \"your father,\" and the author responded that he's not their dad, which upset the mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider family dynamics. The author's mom is probably feeling that the stepfather is now part of the family, so using \"father\" is a way to legitimize him. But the author isn't comfortable because of the lack of relationship and conflicts. \n\nIs the author wrong for refusing? Well, the stepfather isn't their biological father, and if they don't have a good relationship, it's natural to not want to use that term. The mom might expect the author to accept the stepfather as a father figure, but if the stepfather hasn't earned that role through positive interaction, the author's stance is valid. \n\nAlso, the mom's reaction being angry and calling the author ungrateful seems a bit harsh. The author's response was factual, not hostile. The stepfather's behavior and the arguments might contribute to the author's resistance. \n\nIn many cases, family expectations can be stressful, but personal feelings are important. The author isn't obligated to use a title if they don't feel it's appropriate. So, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
