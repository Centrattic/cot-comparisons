In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation is that the parents got divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepfather isn't really trying to connect. They argue a lot, and when the mom refers to him as \"your father,\" the author says he's not their dad, which upset the mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The stepfather isn't a biological parent and hasn't built a strong relationship with the author. The author's resistance to calling him \"Dad\" seems based on their actual relationship. The mom is pushing for the title, maybe expecting the stepfather to take on a father role, but he hasn't really done so. The author's response was factual and not angry, but the mom took it as ungrateful. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, titles like \"Dad\" are personal and depend on the relationship. If the stepfather isn't acting like a father figure, the author isn't obligated to use that term. The mom's reaction might be unreasonable because she's imposing a title without considering the child's feelings or the stepfather's role. The key points are the lack of effort from the stepfather and the author's legitimate feelings. So, the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
