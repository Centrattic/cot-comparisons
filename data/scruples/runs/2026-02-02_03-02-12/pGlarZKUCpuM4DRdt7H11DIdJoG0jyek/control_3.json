In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation is that after a divorce and remarriage, the stepfather isn't very involved with the kid, they argue a lot, and the mom is pushing the kid to refer to him as \"father.\" The kid says \"he's not my dad,\" which upset the mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional dynamics here. The stepfather isn't really making an effort to connect, and there are arguments between him and the mom. The kid's resistance is understandable because they don't feel a close relationship. The mom's reaction seems harsh, labeling the kid as ungrateful. \n\nThe key points here are the stepfather's behavior and the kid's feelings. If the stepfather isn't trying to build a relationship, it's not the kid's fault for not feeling comfortable with the term \"Dad.\" The mom might be expecting more from the kid that the stepfather isn't actually providing. \n\nAlso, the kid's statement was a factual correction rather than an attack. The mom's anger might stem from her own expectations or pressure to maintain a certain family dynamic. But the kid isn't obligated to adopt a title if they don't feel it's appropriate. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people often have different boundaries regarding familial terms. The kid's right to set that boundary shouldn't be seen as disrespectful unless the stepfather has genuinely tried to be a father figure. Since the stepfather hasn't made an effort, the kid is justified in their stance. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
