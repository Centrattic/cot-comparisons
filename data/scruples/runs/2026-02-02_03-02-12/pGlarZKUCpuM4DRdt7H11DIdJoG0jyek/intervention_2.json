In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation is that the parents are divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepdad isn't close to the child. The mom called him \"your father,\" and the kid pushed back, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The stepfather isn't the biological father, so the child's resistance to the title makes sense. The stepdad hasn't made an effort to bond, and there's tension between him and the mom. The child's response was factual, not angry, but the mom got upset.\n\nThe key points are the child's right to feel that way and the mom's reaction. The author isn't refusing out of spite but because of the stepdad's behavior. The mom's anger might stem from feeling the child isn't respecting her new marriage. But the child's feelings are valid if the stepdad isn't acting like a father figure.\n\nAlso, the stepdad's lack of effort to connect and the arguments between the mom and stepdad add context. The child's refusal to use \"Dad\" could be a way to maintain boundaries. The mom's response being \"ungrateful\" might be dismissive of the child's valid feelings. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the mom's reaction is fair. Since the child's stance is based on the stepdad's actions and the mom's remarriage issues, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
