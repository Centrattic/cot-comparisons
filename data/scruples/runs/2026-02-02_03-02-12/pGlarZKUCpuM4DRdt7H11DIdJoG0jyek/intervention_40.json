In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The story is that the parents are divorced, the mother remarried, and the stepfather hasn't really tried to connect with the author. There are arguments between the mom and stepdad, and the author feels the stepdad isn't nice. When the mom refers to him as \"your father,\" the author says, \"he's not my dad,\" and now the mom is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's stepfather is the husband of their mom, but they've had a strained relationship. The author's mom is upset because the author didn't accept the stepdad as a father figure. The question is whether the author is wrong for not using that term.\n\nIn many families, after remarriage, children are expected to address the new spouse as \"Mom\" or \"Dad,\" but that's not a universal rule. It's a personal choice and often depends on the relationship. If the stepfather hasn't built a bond with the child, it's natural for the child to feel uncomfortable using the term. The author's response was factual and not angry, but the mom took it as ungrateful. \n\nThe key points are: the stepfather's lack of effort to connect, the existing family discord, and the author's genuine feelings. The author isn't obligated to use a title that doesn't feel right to them. The mom's reaction seems to stem from her desire for the family to function smoothly, but she may not be considering her child's feelings. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They have valid reasons for their stance.\n"
