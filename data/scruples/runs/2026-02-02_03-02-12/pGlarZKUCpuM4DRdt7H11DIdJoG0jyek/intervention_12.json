In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not calling their stepfather \"Dad.\" So the situation is that the parents are divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepdad isn't really close with the kid. The mom refers to him as \"your father,\" and the kid says he's not my dad. The mom got angry and hasn't spoken to the kid since. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The child has a real father, so the stepfather isn't the biological dad. The kid is living with the mom and stepdad, but the stepdad hasn't made an effort to connect and they argue a lot. The mom is pushing for the kid to call the stepdad \"Dad,\" but the kid is resistant. \n\nThe key point here is the child's right to choose how they address their stepfather. There's no legal requirement to use a title, and it's a personal choice. The mom is upset because the kid isn't accepting the stepdad as a father figure, but if the stepdad hasn't built that relationship, it's understandable the kid would be reluctant. The mom's reaction seems harsh, especially since the stepdad might not deserve the title in the kid's eyes. \n\nAlso, the stepdad's behavior\u2014arguing with the mom and not trying to get to know the kid\u2014could contribute to the kid's resistance. The kid isn't being disrespectful; they're stating a fact based on their relationship. The mother's anger might stem from her desire to legitimize the stepdad's role, but that doesn't override the child's feelings. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. They have a valid reason to not want to use the term \"Dad\" given the lack of a fatherly relationship. The mom's reaction is more about her own expectations than the child's feelings. So the answer should be B.\n"
