In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for refusing to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation involves a divorce, remarriage, and tension between the mother and stepfather. The stepfather isn't close with the author and they argue. The mom calls him \"your father,\" and the author corrects her, leading to a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The author isn't happy with the stepfather's behavior and their relationship is strained. The mom expects the author to accept the stepfather as a father figure, but the author feels it's insincere given the circumstances. The mom got angry and hasn't spoken to the author since.\n\nLegally, the stepfather isn't the biological father, so the author isn't obligated to call him \"Dad.\" Emotionally, titles like \"Dad\" carry significance. If the stepfather hasn't earned that respect through actions, the author's resistance makes sense. The mom's reaction is harsh, possibly because she wants to maintain family unity, but her anger over a title might be misplaced. The author's statement was factual and not hostile, so their response isn't unreasonable. The key points are the stepfather's lack of effort to connect and the mother's unrealistic expectations. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing their feelings over a title that doesn't feel earned. So the answer is B.\n"
