I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple living together where the boyfriend repeatedly borrows the girlfriend's car without paying for gas or maintenance. The girlfriend has warned him multiple times and finally revoked his permission to borrow the car, leading to an argument where he accuses her of being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ownership aspect. The car is the girlfriend's, and she's covering all costs including maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend refuses to contribute because it's not his car. That seems like a valid point from her side. He's using her resources without contributing, which is a common point of conflict in relationships. \n\nNext, the repeated instances of him borrowing the car and returning it empty, costing her $60 each time. She's given multiple warnings, but he continues, not even remembering to refill the tank. This shows a pattern of behavior that's disrespectful to her and her property. \n\nWhen she finally stops allowing him to borrow the car, he reacts negatively, calling her names and bringing up past issues. His reaction seems to be deflection and gaslighting, shifting blame onto her instead of taking responsibility for his actions. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, mutual respect and consideration are key. If one partner is consistently using the other's resources without contributing, that's a problem. The girlfriend's decision to stop allowing him to borrow the car is a reasonable step to protect her own interests. His reaction indicates a lack of respect for her boundaries and feelings. \n\nThere's no mention of any agreements or shared responsibilities in the situation. Since the car is hers and he's not contributing, her stance is justifiable. The boyfriend's behavior is inconsiderate, and her response is a logical consequence to enforce her boundaries.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author (the girlfriend) is not in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions and reactions are the main issues here. So the answer should be B.\n"
