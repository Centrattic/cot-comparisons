I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's boyfriend keeps borrowing her car to visit his grandmother, but he never refuels it, and he refuses to pay for gas or maintenance. The author is upset and has finally decided to stop letting him borrow the car, but he's angry and says she's being vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The boyfriend is using the car, which the author owns and pays for, without contributing to the costs. Even though the car isn't his, he's using it and not compensating her. The trips are long, so gas costs are significant. The author has warned him multiple times, and he keeps doing it, leading her to cut him off. The boyfriend responds with anger and accuses her of being unreasonable.\n\nThe key points here are about shared responsibilities in a relationship and respect for property. The author is paying for the car's maintenance, insurance, and now gas because he uses it. The boyfriend's refusal to contribute could be seen as unfair. The author setting a boundary is understandable. The boyfriend's reaction seems dismissive and not taking her concerns seriously. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. She's standing up for her own property and the financial burdens. The boyfriend is not respecting her boundaries or sharing the costs. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
