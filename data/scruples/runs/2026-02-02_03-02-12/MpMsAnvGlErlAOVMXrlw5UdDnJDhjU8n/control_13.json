I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. So, the main issue here is that the boyfriend is borrowing the car to visit his grandma, but he's using all the gas each time and not refilling it. The author is upset because they have to pay for the maintenance, insurance, and gas, while the boyfriend refuses to contribute since it's not his car.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of the situation. The boyfriend is using the car, which costs money in terms of gas. If he's not paying for the gas he uses, that's an issue because the author is shouldering all the costs. The boyfriend's argument is that he's sorry he forgot, but he doesn't take responsibility beyond that. The author has given multiple warnings, which the boyfriend ignored. \n\nThe key points here are responsibility and respect. The author is trying to enforce boundaries because they feel it's unfair. The boyfriend, on the other hand, isn't respecting those boundaries and is reacting negatively when confronted. When he gets upset, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive, that shows he's not taking her concerns seriously. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should be considerate of each other's resources and feelings. Since the car is the author's and she's covering all the costs, it's reasonable for her to expect that any usage by the boyfriend should be compensated. The boyfriend's refusal to pay for the gas he uses or to refill the tank is disrespectful. The author taking away the privilege of borrowing the car after repeated requests is a logical consequence for his behavior. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction suggests he's not maturely handling the situation. He's blaming her instead of taking responsibility for his actions. So, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and following through when they're violated. The boyfriend's actions and response are the main issues here, not the author's decision to stop letting him borrow the car.\n"
