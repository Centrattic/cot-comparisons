I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend not contributing to car costs and gas when he borrows the car to visit his grandma. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend and his partner live together. She has a car she just paid off, and he refuses to pay for maintenance or insurance because it's not his. He borrows the car multiple times, each time taking it with a full tank and returning it empty, costing her $60 each time. She warned him several times, but he didn't change his behavior. Now she's stopping him from borrowing the car, and he's upset, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. From what I understand, she's clearly communicated her boundaries about the car and gas. He's not respecting those boundaries by not paying for the gas and ignoring her warnings. She's taking away the privilege of borrowing the car as a consequence. That seems reasonable. He's not contributing to shared expenses because it's not his car, but he's using her car, which she's solely responsible for. He's being inconsiderate by not reimbursing her for the gas each time. Her response is to stop letting him borrow it, which is a valid reaction to someone not respecting her rules. His reaction of yelling and name-calling shows he's not taking her concerns seriously. \n\nI think she's not in the wrong here. He's the one not following through on his end. So the answer should be B.\n"
