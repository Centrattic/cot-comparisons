I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting her boyfriend visit his grandmother because he keeps borrowing her car without paying for gas. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend and author have been living together for three years. He sold his car when he went back to university two years ago. So now, the author has a small car she's paying for, including maintenance and insurance. The boyfriend refuses to contribute because it's not his car. \n\nEach time he borrows the car, he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty after a 3.5-hour trip. The cost of a tank is $60, and this has happened three times. She's been upset each time, and he just apologizes but doesn't change his behavior. She warned him multiple times that if he keeps doing this, she'll stop letting him borrow the car. Now, when he asked again, she said no, and he got angry, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. The boyfriend is using her car, which he's not contributing to. Even if the car can make the trip on one tank, the cost is still being borne by her. He's not paying for the gas, and he's not even refilling the tank when he takes it for other things. She's given warnings, and he hasn't changed. Then she revokes his ability to borrow the car, and he reacts negatively.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if someone is using your car, it's reasonable to expect them to cover the costs. Gas is a direct expense, and even if he's not paying for the car itself, the usage costs should be shared. The boyfriend's not paying for gas is causing her financial burden. She's tried to communicate her boundaries, which is important in any relationship, especially when it comes to shared resources. \n\nWhen she says no, he's upset and accuses her of being vindictive. That's a common tactic when someone doesn't want to accept responsibility for their actions. She's not being unreasonable; she's setting a boundary after repeated issues. He's the one who's not respecting her limits by not following through on paying for gas. \n\nFinancial responsibilities in a relationship can be tricky. If they live together, maybe they should split bills, but the car is hers. So she's within her rights to set conditions for its use. The boyfriend's refusal to pay for gas is the main issue here. She's trying to protect her own financial interests, which is valid. \n\nAlso, the fact that he took it for other things and never refilled the tank shows a pattern of behavior. She gave him clear warnings, and he didn't change. So her decision to stop letting him borrow the car is a logical consequence. His reaction seems to be about his own inconvenience rather than acknowledging her point.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's justified in her actions because she's communicated her needs, and he hasn't respected them. The boyfriend is the one who's not contributing, so the answer should be B.\n"
