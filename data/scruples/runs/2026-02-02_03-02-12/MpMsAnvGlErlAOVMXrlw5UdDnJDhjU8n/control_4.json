I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation (the author) is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author not allowing their boyfriend to visit his grandma because he keeps borrowing her car and not refilling the gas, which costs her money each time. The boyfriend has been warned multiple times but continues the behavior, and now he's upset when she revokes his privilege.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of the situation. The car is the author's, and she's paying for maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend isn't contributing financially, which could be a point of contention. He borrows the car and uses up the gas, which costs her money each time. He apologizes but doesn't fix the issue, so the author revokes his access. \n\nIs the author within her rights to do so? Since it's her car, she has the right to set the terms for borrowing it. The boyfriend's actions are costing her money repeatedly, and he's not compensating her. His argument that it's not his car is valid, but he's using her resources without contributing. The author's response is to stop lending the car, which is a reasonable action considering the repeated violations of her conditions.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to be about how he's being treated, calling her names like \"vindictive,\" which might indicate he's not taking responsibility. The author is trying to enforce a boundary to protect her financial interests. \n\nSo, from an ethical standpoint, the author isn't wrong. She's standing up for her property and financial boundaries. The boyfriend, on the other hand, is not respecting those boundaries and not taking accountability. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
