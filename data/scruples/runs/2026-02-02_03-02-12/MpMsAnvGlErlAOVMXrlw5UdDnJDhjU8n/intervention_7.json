I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their boyfriend borrow the car anymore. The boyfriend uses the car multiple times, each time taking it with a full tank and returning it empty. The author is upset because they have to pay for the gas and maintenance, and the boyfriend refuses to contribute. After several instances, the author decides to stop letting him borrow the car, leading to an argument where the boyfriend accuses her of being vindictive.\n\nFirst, the key points here are responsibility and fairness. The car is the author's property, and they're the one paying for it. The boyfriend is using it without contributing, which seems unfair. The author gave multiple warnings, but the boyfriend didn't change his behavior. The author's decision to stop lending the car is a reasonable response to protect their own resources. The boyfriend's reaction of being upset and making accusations doesn't justify his behavior. Since the car isn't his, he has no right to expect free use and should have taken responsibility for the gas. The author isn't in the wrong here; they're standing up for their rights and the financial responsibilities they've been shouldering alone."
