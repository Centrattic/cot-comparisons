I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the boyfriend not paying for gas when he borrows the car. The author is a girlfriend who owns the car, and they live together. The boyfriend uses the car without contributing to gas or maintenance, which is causing tension.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The boyfriend uses the car multiple times for trips, each time leaving it with an empty tank. The cost is $60 per tank, and it's happened three times. The author has warned him that if he keeps doing this, she won't let him borrow the car. When he asks again, she revokes the privilege, and he gets angry, calling her names.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The boyfriend is using a car he doesn't own or pay for, and not covering the associated costs. That seems unfair. The author has set boundaries and tried warning him multiple times, which is reasonable. When he doesn't comply, she removes the privilege. His reaction is to accuse her of being juvenile. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if someone uses a resource they don't pay for, the owner is justified in restricting access. The boyfriend's actions are inconsiderate, and the author is protecting her own property. There's no indication she's being unreasonable beyond the initial setup. The boyfriend's response is more about deflection than addressing the issue. \n\nSo the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong. The key here is that the boyfriend isn't covering the costs he's incurring, and the author is asserting her right to control her property. The boyfriend's anger seems misplaced here.\n"
