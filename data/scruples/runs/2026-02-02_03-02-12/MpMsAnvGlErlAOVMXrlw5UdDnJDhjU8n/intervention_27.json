I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's boyfriend keeps borrowing her car to visit his grandma, which is 3.5 hours away. Each time he takes the car, he uses up all the gas and comes back empty. The author is upset because she's covering the cost of the car, maintenance, insurance, and gas. She's given him warnings, told him he needs to pay for the gas or fill it up each time, but he doesn't. Now, when he wants to take the car again, she says no, and he's upset, calling her names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities here. The car is hers, so she owns it and is paying for it. He's not contributing to the maintenance, insurance, or gas. When he uses the car, he's using resources she's paying for. Using all the gas without refilling is a direct financial hit to her. She's trying to set a boundary by not letting him borrow the car anymore when he's not respecting the agreement. \n\nHe's supposed to return the car with a full tank. If he doesn't, he's responsible for the cost. The fact that he keeps forgetting or not doing it, despite being warned, is on him. The author is protecting her own financial interests by stopping the car borrowing. His reaction, calling her names, seems like a poor response. He's the one not following through on his responsibilities.\n\nThe key points are ownership, financial responsibility, and respect for agreed terms. Since the car is hers and he's not covering the costs, the author is within her rights to set boundaries. Her actions are a reasonable response to his repeated negligence. Therefore, she's not in the wrong here.\n"
