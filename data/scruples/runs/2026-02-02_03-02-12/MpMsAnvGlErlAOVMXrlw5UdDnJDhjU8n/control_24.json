I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the boyfriend borrowing the author's car to visit his grandmother, but each time he returns it with an empty tank, costing the author money. The author has warned him multiple times, but he keeps forgetting or ignoring the issue. Now, the author refuses to let him borrow the car again, leading to an argument where the boyfriend accuses her of being juvenile.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the responsibilities here. The car is the author's, so she's responsible for all expenses. The boyfriend is using it without contributing to the costs, which seems unfair. Even though he's her partner, she's the owner, and he's not helping with maintenance, insurance, or gas. The boyfriend's actions are inconsiderate, as he's not replenishing the gas each time. The author has given warnings, but he hasn't changed his behavior. \n\nWhen she finally stops allowing him to take the car, he reacts angrily, calling her names and bringing up old issues. That's a red flag. His response is disrespectful and dismissive of her feelings. The author's decision to revoke the privilege after repeated warnings is reasonable because he hasn't met his end of the bargain. \n\nThe key points are ownership, responsibility, and communication. The author isn't wrong for standing up for her own car and expenses. The boyfriend's behavior is the main issue here\u2014failing to respect her property and contribute fairly. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
