I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the boyfriend using the author's car to visit his grandmother three times, each time leaving it empty without refilling the gas. The author has repeatedly warned him, and after he ignores the warnings, she refuses to let him borrow the car again. He then gets upset and accuses her of being juvenile.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ownership of the car. It's the author's car, and she's the one paying for maintenance and insurance. The boyfriend isn't contributing financially, which is a point in her favor. The car isn't his, so he doesn't have an inherent right to use it. The fact that he borrowed it three times and left it empty without refilling shows a pattern of irresponsible behavior.\n\nThe author gave multiple warnings, which he ignored. That's a key point. She was giving him chances to correct his behavior, but he didn't follow through. Her response was to stop letting him borrow the car, which is a reasonable action since she owns it. The boyfriend's reaction of calling her names and accusing her of holding grudges seems unfair, especially since he was the one not respecting her boundaries.\n\nFinancial responsibility is a big factor here. The gas cost $60 each time, and he never offered to cover that. The author is justified in being upset about the expenses, as it's her money being spent. The boyfriend's refusal to contribute to the costs or even to refill the gas shows a lack of consideration for her financial situation.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author tried to communicate her concerns, and he dismissed them. Effective communication in relationships requires both parties to listen and respect each other's needs. The boyfriend's dismissive attitude (\"he forgot\") without genuine effort to fix the problem indicates a lack of respect. The author's decision to revoke the car privilege is a logical consequence of his continued neglect.\n\nThe boyfriend's outburst about her being juvenile is misplaced. She was acting in her own interest to protect her property and finances. His emotional reaction doesn't justify his previous actions. The key here is whether the author's actions were reasonable given the circumstances. Since the car is hers and he didn't follow agreed-upon terms, she's within her rights to stop allowing him to use it.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. She owned the car, communicated her expectations, and took appropriate action when those expectations weren't met. The boyfriend's behavior was the issue, not hers. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
