I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a couple where the boyfriend borrows the girl's car to visit his grandma, but every time he takes it, he empties the gas tank and doesn't fill it up or pay for the gas. The girl is upset because she's paying for the car's maintenance, insurance, and gas, and he's not contributing. She's told him multiple times that if he keeps doing this, she'll stop letting him borrow the car. When he asks again, she says no, and he gets angry, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ownership of the car. The car is hers, so she has the right to set the terms for borrowing it. The boyfriend isn't paying for the car or the gas, which he's been using. Each trip costs $60 for gas, and he's done this three times already. He's supposed to bring it back with a full tank but doesn't. She's given warnings, so she's made her expectations clear. He's not following through, so she revokes the privilege.\n\nIs the boyfriend in the wrong? He's using her car without contributing to the costs, which seems unfair. She's being reasonable by setting boundaries. When he asks again, she's enforcing her rules. His reaction of anger and accusing her of being vindictive might be his way of deflecting his own responsibility.\n\nFrom the girl's perspective, she's standing up for her own property and expenses. The boyfriend isn't respecting her terms. The key points here are ownership and agreed-upon terms. Since he's not following through, her response is justified. The boyfriend's frustration stems from her enforcing her boundaries, which is her right.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because she's protecting her property and financial interests. The boyfriend's actions have been the issue, and she's appropriately addressing them. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
