I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation (AITA) is in the wrong. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nThe boyfriend and girlfriend have been together three years and live together. The boyfriend sold his car when he went back to university two years ago. The girl has a small car she pays for, including maintenance and insurance. The boyfriend refuses to pay anything because \"it's not his car.\" His grandma is 3.5 hours away, and he's visited her a few times, each time borrowing the car. He takes it with a full tank and returns it empty, costing her $60 each time. He forgets to refill it each time, even after warnings. The girl has told him multiple times that if he keeps doing this, she won't let him borrow the car anymore. Now, he wants to take it again, and she says no. He gets angry, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive, bringing up old stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate who is at fault here. The key points are: ownership of the car, responsibility for costs, and communication.\n\nThe car is hers, so she has the right to set the terms for borrowing it. He's using it without contributing to the costs, which is fair to be upset about. Gas is a significant expense, and he's not covering it despite being asked. She's given clear warnings, but he hasn't complied. When she finally follows through on her threat, he reacts negatively, which seems like the bigger issue here.\n\nHe's using her car, which he doesn't pay for, and expecting to use it without contributing. That's a problem because he's not respecting her financial boundaries. She's not wrong to enforce her rules. His reaction is over the top; instead of addressing her concerns (like offering to pay for gas or a carpool plan), he accuses her of being vindictive. That's a classic deflection.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe he's in a tough spot financially and can't afford to contribute, but that's not mentioned here. The problem is his refusal to help despite her clear communication. Also, maybe he thought borrowing the car was a favor, but that's not how she sees it. The core issue is his lack of consideration for her financial burden.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, she's not wrong to set boundaries. He's not wrong in wanting to visit his grandma, but he needs to respect her terms. Since he hasn't, and she's had enough, she's justified in her decision. The boyfriend's anger and accusations are more telling of his poor handling of the situation. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
