I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The author and her boyfriend live together, and he borrowed her car multiple times to visit his grandma, which is 3.5 hours away. Each time, he takes it with a full tank and comes back empty, costing her $60 each time. She's been upset about this because he doesn't pay for the car's maintenance or insurance and now the gas too. She warned him he can't borrow the car anymore if he keeps doing this. When he tried to take it again, she said no, and he got angry, calling her names. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider ownership. The car is hers, so she has the right to set rules about its use. He's not contributing financially to the car, which is a point. She's covering all costs\u2014maintenance, insurance, gas. He's using it without contributing, which seems unfair. The three times he took the car and didn't refill the tank, even after warnings, shows a pattern of ignoring her concerns. She's tried to communicate and set boundaries, which is reasonable. When he broke the rules again, she took away his access, which is her right as the owner. His reaction seems excessive and dismissive of her valid concerns. \n\nBut maybe some would argue that he's in a relationship and should be more considerate, but the author is within her rights to enforce the rules. He's not respecting her property and her boundaries. The financial aspect is a big part here. She's shouldering all the costs, and his behavior is adding to her expenses without contributing. The fact that he's not paying for anything related to the car makes his use of it without reimbursement questionable. \n\nAlso, when he gets angry and accuses her of being vindictive, that's a red flag. Healthy relationships require mutual respect and consideration. She's trying to protect her resources, and he's not respecting that. So, I think the author is justified in her actions. He's the one who isn't respecting her property and boundaries, leading her to revoke his access. Therefore, the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
