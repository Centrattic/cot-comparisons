I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting her boyfriend borrow her car anymore. The boyfriend has borrowed the car multiple times, each time leaving it with an empty tank, costing the author around $60 each time. He's done this three times and hasn't offered to pay for the gas. The author has warned him multiple times, but he keeps doing it. Now, the boyfriend is upset, says she's being vindictive, and she's standing her ground.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of the situation. The car is hers, and she's the one paying for maintenance, insurance, and gas. When he borrows it, he uses her fuel, which is a direct cost. Even if the car can make the trip on a full tank, he's using all the gas and not replenishing it. That's a clear financial burden on her. She's given him multiple chances and warnings, but he hasn't followed through. \n\nNext, the boyfriend's reaction. He's calling her names and not taking responsibility. That's a red flag. If he's the one who's supposed to care about the gas, and he's not even filling it up after using it, he's not being considerate. His argument that it's not his car doesn't absolve him of responsibility when he's using her resources. \n\nLegally, the car is hers, so she has the right to set boundaries. She's not wrong for not allowing him to borrow it anymore after repeated violations of her rules. The boyfriend's behavior is inconsiderate and disrespectful, especially since he's been warned multiple times. \n\nEmotionally, the author is standing up for herself, which is healthy. Letting someone take advantage of you, especially in a relationship, can lead to bigger issues. The boyfriend's reaction suggests he's not maturely handling the situation, which might indicate deeper problems in the relationship. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe he didn't realize the cost? But he's been told multiple times. Or that he's contributing in other ways? The problem is about gas specifically, and he's not contributing to that. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is justified in her actions. She's protecting her own property and finances, and the boyfriend's behavior is the issue here. So the answer is B.\n"
