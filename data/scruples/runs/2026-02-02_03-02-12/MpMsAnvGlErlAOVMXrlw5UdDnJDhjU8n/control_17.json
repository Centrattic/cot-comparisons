I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The boyfriend has been borrowing the author's car to visit his grandma, but each time he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty, costing the author money. The author warned him multiple times, but he didn't change his behavior, so she decided to stop letting him borrow the car. He got angry, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are: the car is the author's, he's using it without contributing to costs, despite warnings. The author is standing up for her own property and expenses. The boyfriend's behavior is repeated and he's not taking responsibility. The author's actions are a result of his repeated neglect.\n\nThe boyfriend is using the car, which is her property, and not compensating her for the gas. Even if they live together, the car is hers. It's reasonable for her to expect him to cover the costs since he's the one using it. He's not just borrowing it once but multiple times, and each time he's not refilling the tank. That's a financial burden on her.\n\nHer response is to stop letting him borrow the car, which is a direct consequence of his actions. He's upset about being held accountable, but she's within her rights to set boundaries regarding her own property. The boyfriend's reaction seems immature and dismissive of her concerns. She's not being vindictive; she's protecting her expenses. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's property and financial boundaries. The author is asserting her right to her car and the associated costs. The boyfriend's refusal to pay and her subsequent action make her the reasonable party here. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The boyfriend is the one not respecting her property and finances.\n"
