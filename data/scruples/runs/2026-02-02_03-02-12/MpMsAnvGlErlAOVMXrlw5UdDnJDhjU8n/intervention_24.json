I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend who's been borrowing the author's car multiple times, each time using up the gas without refilling it. The car is the author's, and they're paying for maintenance and insurance. The boyfriend refuses to contribute anything, even though he uses the car. The author has warned him multiple times, and now the boyfriend is upset when the author stops allowing him to borrow the car.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of the situation. The car is the author's, so they have the right to set the terms for its use. The boyfriend is using the car without contributing to the costs, which the author finds unfair. The boyfriend's behavior of not refilling the gas is a recurring issue, and he's not taking the warnings seriously. The author decided to stop allowing him to use the car as a result of his continued disrespect. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is also a point to consider. He's upset and accuses the author of being juvenile and holding grudges. However, the author has given multiple warnings, so it's not like they didn't try to address the problem before taking action. The boyfriend's refusal to comply with the agreed-upon terms (returning the car with a full tank) is a breach of trust and responsibility. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author has the right to protect their property and set boundaries, especially when those boundaries are repeatedly violated. The boyfriend, on the other hand, is not respecting the author's property and financial responsibilities. The author's decision to revoke the car usage is a reasonable consequence for the boyfriend's actions. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they are standing up for their boundaries and protecting their own resources. The boyfriend's actions are the issue here, not the author's response.\n"
