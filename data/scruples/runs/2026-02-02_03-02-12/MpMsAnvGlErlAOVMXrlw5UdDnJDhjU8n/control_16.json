I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend and his girlfriend living together. The key points are about the car and gas.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend sold his own car when he went back to university, so now he relies on the girlfriend's car. She's paying for maintenance, insurance, and gas. Every time he borrows the car to visit his grandma, which is a 3.5-hour trip, he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty. Each trip costs $60 in gas. This has happened three times, and she's unhappy because she feels it's unfair that she's covering these costs. He apologizes but doesn't change his behavior, and she's warned him multiple times. Now, he wants to make another trip, and she refuses, leading to an argument where he accuses her of being vindictive.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author (the girlfriend) is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me break it down. The boyfriend is using the car, which isn't his, but he's not contributing financially. Even though he says he's sorry, he doesn't follow through. The girlfriend has asked him to stop, so when he asks again, she refuses. He gets upset and calls her names. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if someone is using another person's property and incurring costs, it's reasonable for the owner to expect some contribution. The boyfriend isn't paying, which could be seen as unfair. The girlfriend has set boundaries, and when he doesn't respect them, she removes the privilege. That seems justified. His reaction of calling her names might be immature, but the core issue is about the financial responsibility and respect for her property.\n\nIs there any reason to think the girlfriend is wrong? Maybe if she didn't make her expectations clear, but she mentions she gave multiple warnings. He knew the consequences but ignored them. So he's responsible for not adhering to her terms. Her decision to stop allowing him to use the car is a logical consequence. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
