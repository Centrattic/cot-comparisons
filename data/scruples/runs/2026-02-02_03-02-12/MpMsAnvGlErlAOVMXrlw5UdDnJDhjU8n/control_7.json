I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the boyfriend and the author live together. He sold his car when he went back to university two years ago. The author has her own car, which she's paying for entirely, including insurance and maintenance. The boyfriend keeps borrowing her car to visit his grandma, which is 3.5 hours away. Each time he takes it, he uses a full tank and brings it back empty. The tank costs $60, and this has happened three times. The author is upset because he's not contributing to the costs and never refills the gas. She warned him multiple times, and now she's decided to stop letting him borrow the car. He got angry, called her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about shared responsibilities in a relationship. The author clearly states that the car isn't his, and he refuses to pay anything for it. He uses the car for his purposes, which is visiting family, but doesn't cover the expenses. The author is paying for everything, which is fair if it's her car. The boyfriend is using it without contributing, which seems unfair. The author has given warnings, so she's tried to communicate. When he ignores the warnings and continues, she takes action by revoking the privilege. He reacts negatively, which might be his issue.\n\nIn a relationship where people live together, it's reasonable to expect that if one person is using the other's car, there should be some shared responsibility. The boyfriend's refusal to pay for gas or maintenance could be seen as inconsiderate. The author is within her rights to set boundaries, especially when she's made it clear. The boyfriend's anger and accusations might be his way of deflecting responsibility. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because she's standing up for her own property and being fair in her expectations. The boyfriend's actions are the ones that are unfair. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
