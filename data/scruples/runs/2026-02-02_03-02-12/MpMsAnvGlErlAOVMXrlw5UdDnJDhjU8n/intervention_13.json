I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting her boyfriend visit his grandma because he keeps draining her car's gas without refilling it.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend uses the car three times, each time leaving it empty. Each trip costs $60 for gas, which adds up to $180 total. The author mentions she's been upset about this and warned him multiple times. He keeps doing it and just apologizes without fixing the behavior. The car is hers, so she's responsible for maintenance and insurance, which is a valid point. When she finally says no to the trip, he gets angry, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if someone uses your resources (like a car) repeatedly without contributing to the cost, that's a problem. The boyfriend isn't taking responsibility for the gas he uses, which is part of the car's maintenance. The author is protecting her own property and finances. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be dismissing her legitimate concerns and not taking accountability for his actions. His behavior of using the car without considering the cost is the main issue here. The author's response is reasonable because she's setting boundaries after repeated warnings. So, the boyfriend is in the wrong for not respecting her property and her financial situation. The author isn't being unreasonable; she's standing up for herself after consistent disregard for her rules. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
