I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple who live together. The boyfriend has borrowed the author's car multiple times to visit his grandma, which is 3.5 hours away. Each time, he takes the car with a full tank and returns it empty, costing the author $60 each time. The author has warned him several times, but he keeps doing it and doesn't pay for the gas or maintenance. Now, the author refuses to let him borrow the car anymore, and the boyfriend is upset, accusing her of being vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities here. The car is the author's, and she's the one paying for insurance, maintenance, and gas. The boyfriend isn't contributing financially, and he's using her car for his own purposes, which is costing her money. Even though he's her boyfriend, he's an adult and should be responsible for his own expenses, especially for something like visiting family. It seems unfair that he's using her car without contributing to the costs.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior of not refilling the gas despite being asked is a repeated issue. The author gave him multiple warnings, but he didn't change his behavior. That shows he's not respecting her boundaries. When she finally takes away the car, he gets angry and calls her names, which suggests he's not taking her feelings into account.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author is trying to protect her own resources. She's made it clear that if he doesn't adhere to the rules, she can't let him use the car. His reaction is defensive and dismissive, which doesn't help the situation. The author's decision to stop allowing him to borrow the car is a reasonable step to enforce her boundaries after repeated violations.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend is the one who's not respecting her rules and financial contributions. The answer should be B.\n"
