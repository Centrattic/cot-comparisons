I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting her boyfriend borrow her car anymore. The boyfriend has been using her car to visit his grandma, which is a 3.5-hour drive. Each time he borrows the car, he takes it with a full tank and comes back empty, costing her $60 each time. He's done this multiple times and never pays for the gas or maintenance. The author has warned him, and now he's upset, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ownership of the car. It's the author's car, and she's responsible for all the costs. The boyfriend isn't contributing anything, which is a key point. When someone uses another person's property, especially one that incurs ongoing expenses, they should contribute to those costs. The boyfriend's refusal to pay for gas, even after being asked, seems unfair. \n\nThe author has given multiple warnings. He kept taking the car and not refilling the tank, showing a pattern of disrespect for her property and her financial situation. When she finally sets a boundary by not allowing him to borrow the car anymore, he reacts negatively, accusing her of being vindictive. That's a red flag because he's not taking responsibility for his actions but instead blaming her.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if he's using her car, which he's not even paying for, it's reasonable for her to expect some contribution. The fact that he's using it for personal visits to his grandma adds to the issue. She's making a stand to protect her resources, which is her right. His reactions seem immature and dismissive of her feelings and the financial burden she's shouldering.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. She's asserting her boundaries after repeated issues. The boyfriend is the one not respecting her car and her financial limits. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
