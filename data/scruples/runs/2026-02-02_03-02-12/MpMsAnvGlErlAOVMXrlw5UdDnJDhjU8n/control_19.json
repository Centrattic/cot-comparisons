I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after deciding not to let her boyfriend borrow her car anymore because he consistently doesn't refill the gas. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend borrows the car multiple times, each time taking it with a full tank and returning it empty. The gas for each trip costs $60, and he's done this three times. The author is paying for the maintenance, insurance, and now the gas. She's given warnings, but he keeps forgetting or refusing to pay. \n\nThe boyfriend's argument is that the car isn't his, so he doesn't pay for it. But he's using it without contributing anything. The author is trying to protect her investment. When she finally says no, he accuses her of being juvenile and holding grudges.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if someone is using a shared resource (the car) but not contributing to its costs, that's a problem. The boyfriend isn't meeting his part of the agreement. The author is within her rights to set boundaries, especially after multiple warnings. He's losing the privilege because he hasn't respected her terms. His reaction seems to be about her setting a boundary rather than any new issue. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's standing up for herself and enforcing the rules she's clearly communicated. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue, not hers. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
