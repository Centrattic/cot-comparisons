I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend borrowing a car and not refilling the gas each time, leading to the author deciding to stop letting him borrow the car.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The couple lives together. The boyfriend sold his car when he went back to university two years ago. The author has a car they pay for, including maintenance and insurance, and the boyfriend refuses to contribute because \"it's not his.\" He's borrowed the car multiple times, including three trips to see his grandma, each time taking it with a full tank and returning it empty. Each time, the author is upset because they have to pay for the gas. The boyfriend apologizes but doesn't change his behavior. The author warned him that if he continues, they won't let him borrow the car anymore. When he asked again, the author said no, and he got angry, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive. Now the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, from the start, the author is clearly paying for the car and the gas. The boyfriend is not contributing, even though they live together. That seems unfair. The boyfriend is using the car for his purposes (visiting grandma) but not covering any costs. The author set a boundary, and when crossed, they took action. The boyfriend's reaction was anger and accusations. \n\nI think the main issue here is who is at fault. The boyfriend isn't contributing to the shared car's costs, which is a problem when they live together. The author is trying to set a boundary to stop their own expenses from being used for his trips. The boyfriend's behavior is inconsistent\u2014he knows the rules but ignores them. The author's response is to stop allowing him to use the car, which is a reasonable consequence. The boyfriend's anger stems from his refusal to accept responsibility. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They set clear boundaries and followed through. The boyfriend is the one not respecting those boundaries and not taking responsibility. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
