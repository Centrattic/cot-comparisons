I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the boyfriend keeps borrowing the girlfriend's car to visit his grandma, using up all the gas and not paying for it. The girlfriend is upset and has finally said no, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend has borrowed the car three times for his grandma's visits, each time using up all the gas. The cost is $60 per tank, and he doesn't pay anything for the car's maintenance or insurance. The girlfriend has warned him multiple times, but he keeps doing it. Then she refuses to let him borrow the car anymore, and he gets angry, calling her names.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me think about ownership and responsibility here. The car is hers, so she's responsible for all expenses. The boyfriend isn't contributing financially, which is a point. When he borrows it, he's using her resources without helping cover the costs. That seems unfair.\n\nHe promised to remember to refill the gas but never does. She's given warnings, and he's not changed his behavior. When she finally takes away the privilege, he reacts angrily. Her action is a consequence for his repeated failures. Is that fair? Well, she's the owner, so she can set the rules. If he's not respecting her property and her financial burden, then she's justified in stopping him. His anger seems misplaced because he was the one not following through.\n\nPossible counter-arguments: Maybe he's not at fault because he thought it was okay to borrow the car. But he was aware of her expectations and didn't meet them. Also, the car is her responsibility, so he's overstepping by using it without contributing. The boyfriend's behavior is inconsiderate and disrespectful, leading her to revoke access. So she's not in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
