I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a couple living together. The boyfriend has borrowed the girlfriend's car multiple times to visit his grandma, who's 3.5 hours away. Each time, he takes the car with a full tank and returns it empty. The girlfriend is upset because she's paying for the car, maintenance, insurance, and now gas. She's told him several times that if he keeps doing this, he can't borrow the car anymore. When he tries to take it again, she refuses, and he gets angry, calling her names like vindictive.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author (the girlfriend) is in the wrong. The user thinks she's not, but wants confirmation. Let's analyze. \n\nFirst, does the boyfriend have a right to use the car without contributing? The car is hers, and he's not paying for it. Even if they live together, unless there's an agreement, he's not entitled to use it without contributing. The fact that he's using it for personal trips (visiting family) and not replenishing the gas is a problem. Gas is a recurring cost, and he's making her bear that expense repeatedly. Three times already, costing her $60 each time, which adds up. \n\nThe girlfriend has set clear boundaries: if he doesn't stop, she won't let him borrow the car. He's ignored those warnings, so she followed through. His reaction seems to be about the consequences of his actions. He's upset about losing the privilege, not about the fairness of the situation. He's calling her names, which is a red flag for how he handles conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the boyfriend feels that visiting his grandma is important and that he's entitled to use the car for family matters. But since the car isn't his, he should have either contributed to the costs or found another way. The girlfriend is within her rights to set boundaries regarding her property. She's not being vindictive; she's protecting her own expenses. \n\nIs there any nuance? Perhaps the boyfriend didn't realize the impact of his actions, but she did warn him multiple times. The fact that he keeps forgetting to refill the tank or not offering to pay suggests he's not taking responsibility. The girlfriend's decision to revoke the car use is a reasonable consequence after repeated failures to comply with her terms. \n\nSo, the boyfriend's behavior is the issue here. The author isn't in the wrong. She's standing up for her rights and financial responsibility. The answer should be B.\n"
