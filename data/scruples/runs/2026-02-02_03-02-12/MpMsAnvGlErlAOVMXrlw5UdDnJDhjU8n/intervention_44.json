I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend who borrows the girlfriend's car to visit his grandma, but consistently leaves it empty without refilling the tank, costing her money each time. The girlfriend finally refuses to let him borrow the car again, and he gets upset, calling her names. The user thinks the author (girlfriend) isn't in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The boyfriend uses the car multiple times, each time draining the gas without refilling. The cost is $60 per tank, and this happened three times. The girlfriend has warned him before, and he's ignored her. Now she's cutting off the privilege, leading to an argument where he accuses her of being vindictive.\n\nThe main issue is financial responsibility and respect for shared resources. Since the car is hers, she's paying for maintenance, insurance, and gas. He's using it without contributing, which is unfair. She's set boundaries multiple times, and he hasn't respected them. When she enforces the boundary, he reacts poorly. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, she's within her rights to set the rules for her car. He's not respecting her property or her financial contributions. His behavior is inconsiderate, and her response is a reasonable consequence after repeated issues. His reaction suggests he's not taking her concerns seriously, which makes her stance justified.\n\nSo the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
