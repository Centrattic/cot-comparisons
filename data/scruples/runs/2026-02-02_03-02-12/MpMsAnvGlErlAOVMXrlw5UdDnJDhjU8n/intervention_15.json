I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author, who's in a three-year relationship with her boyfriend and lives together, has a car that he borrows. He doesn't pay for maintenance, insurance, or gas, even though he uses it multiple times. Each time he takes it, he uses up all the gas and doesn't refill it, costing her $60 each time. The boyfriend has been told multiple times, but he keeps doing it and then gets angry when she stops him from borrowing the car.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the financial aspects. The car is the author's, so she's responsible for all expenses. The boyfriend isn't contributing financially, which seems unfair. Borrowing a car implies some responsibility, especially if it's a regular thing. If he's using it multiple times, expecting him to contribute to gas is reasonable. The fact that he's been warned but still doesn't follow through is a problem. \n\nThen there's the communication issue. The author gave warnings and eventually took a firm stance, which is her right. The boyfriend's reaction\u2014calling her names like juvenile and vindictive\u2014seems like a poor response. If he's mature, he would acknowledge the problem and maybe find a solution, like splitting gas costs or getting his own car. \n\nThe boyfriend's perspective might be that he's in a relationship and assumes shared responsibilities, but the author made it clear it's her car and he's not contributing. So he's not respecting her boundaries. The author is standing up for her financial interests and setting limits after repeated issues. \n\nPossible counterarguments could be that in a relationship, things are shared, but the author clarified that the car isn't his, and she's paying for it all. The boyfriend's refusal to contribute is the main issue here. The author's actions are a response to his repeated inconsiderate behavior. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's protecting her property and financial well-being after multiple warnings. The boyfriend's inconsiderate and disrespectful behavior is the root problem. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
