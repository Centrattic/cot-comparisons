I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the boyfriend borrows the author's car but never refuels it after using it, leading to conflicts.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend has borrowed the car multiple times, each time taking it with a full tank and returning it empty, costing the author $60 each trip. The author has warned him several times, but he keeps forgetting to refill the gas or pays no attention to it. The author then decides to stop letting him borrow the car, which upsets the boyfriend who accuses her of being vindictive.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. The boyfriend is using the car without contributing to its costs, which is a financial burden on the author. The car is the author's, and she's responsible for maintenance, insurance, and now fuel. The boyfriend's actions are causing repeated financial strain. The author has communicated her concerns and given warnings, yet he continues the behavior. \n\nLegally, if someone borrows your car, they're expected to cover fuel costs unless otherwise agreed. The boyfriend's refusal to pay for anything related to the car he's using is a problem. The author is within her rights to set boundaries regarding the use of her property. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be dismissing her valid concerns, which might indicate that his behavior is the issue here.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument that the car isn't his and that he can't be expected to pay could be a point, but he's using the car and benefiting from it. The fact that he keeps forgetting to refill the gas despite multiple warnings shows a lack of consideration. The author's decision to stop allowing him to borrow the car is a reasonable response to protect her own finances and property. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions are disrespectful and inconsiderate. The author has tried to communicate and set limits, which is the right approach. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
