I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple who live together. The girlfriend (the author) has a car that she owns and pays for, including maintenance and insurance. The boyfriend has borrowed the car multiple times, including to visit his grandma, which is 3.5 hours away. Each time, he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty, costing her $60 each time. She's told him repeatedly that if he continues this, she won't let him borrow the car anymore. When he tries to take it again, she denies him, and he gets upset, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ownership and responsibility. The car is hers, so she has the right to set the terms for its use. She's clearly stated her expectations\u2014that he should return the car with a full tank or compensate her. He's repeatedly failed to meet these conditions. She's given multiple warnings, which he ignored. Now, when she enforces her boundary, he's upset. \n\nFrom her perspective, she's paying all the costs of the car and expects him to respect that. It's reasonable for her to want him to either refill the gas or pay for it. Since he's using her car for long trips, the cost of gas is significant. Her decision to stop letting him borrow the car is a consequence for his repeated negligence. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that visiting his grandma is important and that she's being overly strict. But the key point here is that he agreed to her terms when he borrowed the car. If he couldn't meet those terms, he shouldn't have taken the car. By repeatedly breaking the agreement, he's not respecting her boundaries. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction\u2014calling her names and dismissing her feelings\u2014suggests he's not taking her concerns seriously. The author's response is a direct consequence for his actions. She's holding him accountable for his repeated failures to follow their agreement. \n\nIn terms of fairness, she's not at fault. She's clear about her expectations and followed through when he didn't meet them. The boyfriend's frustration is misplaced because he's the one who violated the agreed-upon conditions. The author's actions are a reasonable response to his irresponsibility.\n"
