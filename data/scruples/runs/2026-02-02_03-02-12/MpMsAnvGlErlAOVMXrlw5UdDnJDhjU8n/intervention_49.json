I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend who keeps borrowing the author's car to visit his grandma, and each time he leaves the car with an empty tank, costing the author money. The author has tried to communicate this and set boundaries, but the boyfriend didn't take it seriously. Now the author refuses to let him borrow the car again, and the boyfriend is upset, calling her names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ownership. The car is the author's, and she's paying for maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend isn't contributing financially because it's not his car. That seems fair from the author's perspective. If someone borrows your personal property, it's reasonable to expect them to cover any costs they incur, like gas. The boyfriend is using the car without contributing, which is a problem.\n\nNext, the boyfriend's actions: he borrows the car, uses all the gas, comes back, and doesn't refill it. He apologizes but doesn't follow through. The author has given multiple warnings, so she's made her expectations clear. When he ignores those warnings and then gets upset when she revokes the privilege, that seems like his fault. He's not respecting her boundaries and is reacting negatively when consequences come.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is also a red flag. He accuses her of being juvenile and holding grudges, which shifts blame. That's not taking responsibility. The author is maintaining her boundaries, which is healthy in a relationship. If someone keeps violating boundaries, it's reasonable to remove the privilege. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the boyfriend feels entitled to use the car since he's living with the author. But entitlement doesn't justify not covering costs. The author isn't in the wrong for setting limits. She's communicated her feelings, given chances, and now enforcing a rule. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here, not the author's decision.\n\nSo overall, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend is at fault for not respecting her terms and reacting poorly. The answer should be B.\n"
