I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple living together for three years. The boyfriend uses the girlfriend's car to visit his grandma, which is 3.5 hours away. Each time he borrows the car, he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty, costing the author $60 each time. This has happened three times. The author has warned him multiple times, but he keeps forgetting or not offering to refill the tank. Now, when the boyfriend wants to take the car again, the author refuses, leading him to accuse her of being juvenile and holding grudges.\n\nFirst, I need to assess who's at fault here. The boyfriend is using the author's car without contributing to the costs. The car is hers, she pays for maintenance, insurance, and gas. He's not paying anything, just borrowing it. The author is trying to set boundaries because he's not respecting her property and the associated expenses. He's not taking responsibility for the gas he uses, and despite warnings, he continues this behavior. When the author finally revokes his permission to use the car, he reacts angrily, calling her names instead of addressing the issue.\n\nThe key points are: ownership of the car, financial responsibility, repeated violations, and the response to the boundary. The boyfriend is using someone else's property without contributing, which is unfair. The author is justified in setting boundaries, especially after multiple failed warnings. The boyfriend's reaction is dismissive and accusatory, which is not constructive. In relationships, mutual respect and accountability are important. The author's actions are a reasonable response to protect her own interests. The boyfriend's behavior is inconsiderate and shows a lack of responsibility. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
