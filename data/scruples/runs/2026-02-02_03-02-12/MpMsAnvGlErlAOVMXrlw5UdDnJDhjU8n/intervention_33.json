I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not letting her boyfriend visit his grandma because he doesn't refill the gas after borrowing her car.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend uses the car multiple times, each time leaving it empty. The car is the author's, and she's responsible for maintenance, insurance, and gas. He refuses to pay anything towards it, even though they live together. She's given warnings, but he keeps forgetting or not caring to refill the tank.\n\nThe argument here is about fairness. The boyfriend is using the car, which the author owns, but not contributing to the costs. Each trip to his grandma's is a 3.5-hour drive, and the gas for a full tank is $60. He's done this three times, so that's $180 he's not contributing to. Plus other trips. The author is frustrated and finally decides to stop letting him borrow the car. He reacts negatively, calling her names.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the car is hers, so she has the right to decide who uses it. If he's using it without contributing, she's within her rights to set boundaries. The boyfriend isn't respecting her ownership and the costs involved. Even though they live together, he owns his own car, which he sold. The author's car is a personal asset, and she's being reasonable in expecting some responsibility from him. His behavior of not refilling the gas is inconsiderate, especially after repeated warnings. The author's decision to stop letting him borrow the car is a logical consequence after he's failed to comply with her requests. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be deflecting responsibility and not taking her feelings into account.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend is the one not respecting her property and her financial contributions. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
