I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend who uses the author's car to visit his grandmother, not refilling the gas each time, and not contributing to maintenance or insurance. The author has warned him multiple times, and now the boyfriend is upset when she refuses to let him borrow the car anymore.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend is using the author's car for his personal trips. Even though he used to own a car, he sold it, so he's relying on the author's vehicle. The author is covering all costs for the car\u2014maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend isn't contributing financially, which seems unfair. Each time he borrows the car, he uses up the gas and doesn't refill it. The author has given warnings, but he keeps doing it, saying he'll remember next time but doesn't. \n\nThe author's response is to stop letting him borrow the car, which leads to the boyfriend getting angry and accusing her of being petty. The key points here are about responsibility and fairness. The author is maintaining the car and paying for all expenses, while the boyfriend is using it without contributing. The boyfriend's actions are inconsiderate and disrespectful, as he repeatedly ignores the author's concerns. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction to the author's decision is also problematic. Instead of acknowledging her valid concerns, he blames her and accuses her of holding grudges. The author isn't being unreasonable; she's standing up for her rights as the car owner. The boyfriend's behavior is inconsiderate, and the author is justified in enforcing boundaries. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
