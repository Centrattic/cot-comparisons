I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves boyfriend and girlfriend living together. The boyfriend uses the girl's car to visit his grandma, which is 3.5 hours away. He borrows the car with a full tank each time and returns it empty, costing the author $60 each time. This has happened three times, and the author is upset because she's paying for the car, maintenance, insurance, and gas, while the boyfriend refuses to contribute. She tells him if he keeps doing this, she won't let him borrow the car anymore. When he asks again, she says no, and he gets angry, accusing her of being vindictive.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the boyfriend is using her car without contributing financially, despite multiple warnings. The author is trying to set a boundary because of the unfair cost burden. The boyfriend is upset and is calling her names, which suggests he's not taking her concerns seriously.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the author is covering all the expenses for the car, including gas for trips he wants to take. The boyfriend's refusal to pay anything is a problem. The author is trying to enforce a rule to protect her own financial interests, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's reaction is immature and dismissive, not addressing the actual issue. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. I don't think so. She's owning a car that he's using without contributing, and she's setting a boundary. His argument that he \"forgot\" repeatedly isn't a valid excuse, and his emotional response doesn't justify his behavior. So the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
