I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend who's been borrowing the author's car to visit his grandma, but he never refills the gas and doesn't pay for the car's costs. The author has warned him multiple times and finally revoked his permission when he didn't change his behavior. The boyfriend then reacted angrily, accusing her of being vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the fairness of the author's actions. The key points are:\n\n1. **Financial Burden**: The author owns the car and is responsible for all expenses, including maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend doesn't contribute, even though he benefits from using the car. This seems unfair because he's using her resources without helping cover the costs.\n\n2. **Gas Management**: The boyfriend takes the car with a full tank and returns it empty, costing the author $60 each time. He's aware this is a problem but continues to ignore it, despite repeated warnings. This is a recurring issue, not a one-time mistake.\n\n3. **Communication and Consequences**: The author gave multiple warnings and set a clear consequence (no more car use) if the behavior continued. The boyfriend didn't heed the warnings, so the author followed through. This is a reasonable step when someone doesn't respect boundaries.\n\n4. **Boyfriend's Reaction**: His anger and accusations (calling her juvenile, holding grudges) seem disproportionate. The author's actions are based on justified concerns about shared responsibilities and unmet agreements. His reaction might be more about defensiveness than recognizing his fault.\n\nNow, considering responsibility in relationships. In a healthy relationship, both parties should communicate needs and compromise. The boyfriend's refusal to pay for any part of the car or the gas, despite using it, shows a lack of consideration. The author is setting a boundary to protect her own resources and well-being, which is reasonable.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If she had given a final warning and he still didn't comply, revoking access is a logical step. There's no indication she's being petty or unreasonable. The boyfriend's behavior (gas costs, not contributing) is the root issue here. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
