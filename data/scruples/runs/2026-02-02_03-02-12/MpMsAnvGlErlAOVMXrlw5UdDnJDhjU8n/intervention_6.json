I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting her boyfriend borrow her car anymore. The boyfriend's grandma is 3.5 hours away, and he's borrowed the car multiple times, each time taking it with a full tank and returning it empty, costing the author $60 each time. She's warned him several times, but he still doesn't pay for the gas or maintenance. Now he wants to take the car again, and she refuses, leading him to accuse her of being vindictive.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend is using her car without contributing to the costs. Even though he doesn't own the car, sharing expenses when borrowing makes sense, especially when it's for his own trips. He's been given multiple warnings but hasn't changed his behavior. The author is within her rights to set boundaries, especially when the financial burden is on her. The boyfriend's reaction is also problematic because he's dismissing her concerns and calling her names instead of addressing the issue. The author's decision to revoke his permission is a reasonable response to his repeated disregard for her feelings and financial contributions. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
