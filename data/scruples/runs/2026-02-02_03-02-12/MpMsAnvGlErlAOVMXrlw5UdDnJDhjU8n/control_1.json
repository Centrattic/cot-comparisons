I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend and girlfriend living together for three years. The boyfriend uses the girl's car to visit his grandma, 3.5 hours away, three times, taking it with a full tank and returning it empty. Each time, the girl is upset because she's paying for the gas and maintenance. The boyfriend doesn't contribute and brushes it off, saying he'll remember but doesn't. The girl finally says no more borrowing the car, leading to an argument where he accuses her of being vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the girl is in the wrong. The key points are: the car is hers, he's using it without contributing, and she's set boundaries. The boyfriend's actions are causing financial strain and disrespect, according to her. He's not following through on his promises to refill the tank. The girl is taking away the privilege after multiple warnings. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if someone is using a shared resource (the car) but not contributing to its costs, that's an issue. The boyfriend's refusal to pay for gas and maintenance when using the car is a problem. The girl has the right to set boundaries, especially since it's her car. His reaction of calling her juvenile and vindictive seems dismissive of her concerns.\n\nPossible arguments against the girl: Maybe she should have communicated better or considered that he's using the car for family visits. But the boyfriend didn't respect her maintenance of the car and the financial burden. The girl gave multiple warnings, which he ignored. So her decision to take away the car is a reasonable response to his continued disrespect.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's standing up for her boundaries and financial responsibilities. The boyfriend is in the wrong for not respecting her car and not contributing.\n"
