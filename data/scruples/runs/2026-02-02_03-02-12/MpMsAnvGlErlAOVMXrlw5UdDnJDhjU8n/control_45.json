I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the boyfriend keeps borrowing the girlfriend's car to visit his grandmother, but he never refuels it after using it. The girlfriend is upset because she's paying for the gas and maintenance, and he refuses to contribute. She finally says she won't let him borrow the car anymore, and he gets upset, calling her names.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The boyfriend uses the car multiple times, each trip costing $60 in gas. He's been warned before and promised to fix it but hasn't. The author (girlfriend) is cutting off the car privilege because of this. The boyfriend reacts negatively, accusing her of being vindictive.\n\nSo, the main issue is fairness. The car is hers, so the responsibility for fuel and maintenance is hers. The boyfriend isn't contributing, even though he benefits from using the car. The girlfriend is trying to set boundaries. When someone uses another person's property, they should cover the associated costs. The boyfriend isn't doing that, which is the core problem.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems immature. He's dismissing her concerns and not taking accountability. The girlfriend's response is about enforcing a rule after repeated issues. She's standing up for herself, which is reasonable. There's no indication she's being unfair\u2014she's addressing a valid issue. The boyfriend's behavior is the main issue here, not hers.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the boyfriend didn't realize the cost, but he's been told multiple times. The fact that he keeps doing it despite warnings shows he doesn't respect her boundaries. The girlfriend's action is a logical consequence. So, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B, No.\n"
