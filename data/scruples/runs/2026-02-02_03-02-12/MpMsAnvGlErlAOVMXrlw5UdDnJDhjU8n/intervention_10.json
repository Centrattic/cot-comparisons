I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a boyfriend borrowing the author's car to visit his grandmother, but not refilling the gas each time, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend and author live together. The boyfriend sold his car when going to university, and the author has a car they pay for. The boyfriend borrows the car, uses all the gas, and doesn't refill it or pay for it. The author has warned him multiple times, and after three incidents, the author decided to stop letting him borrow the car. The boyfriend reacted negatively, calling the author names.\n\nNow, considering fairness. The author is the one paying for the car's maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend is using the car without contributing financially. Even though the car isn't his, he's using a resource the author owns and not covering the costs. The author set boundaries, and when the boyfriend didn't respect them, the author took action. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be dismissing the author's concerns, which could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nIs the author wrong for withholding the car? If someone is using my property and not contributing, it's reasonable to limit access. The boyfriend's behavior is inconsiderate, and the author has the right to set rules. The boyfriend's outburst might indicate he's not taking the author's feelings seriously. So, the author's actions seem justified. The answer should be B (No).\n"
