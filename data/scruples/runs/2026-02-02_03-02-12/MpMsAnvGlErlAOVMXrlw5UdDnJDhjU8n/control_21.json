I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the boyfriend repeatedly borrowing the author's car to visit his grandmother, but not refilling the gas, which costs $60 each time. The author has warned him multiple times, and after three instances, she decided to stop letting him borrow the car. He reacted angrily, accusing her of being juvenile.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ownership of the car. It's the author's car, so she has the right to set the terms of its use. She's paying for maintenance, insurance, and gas, which are all her expenses. The boyfriend isn't contributing financially, which could be a point of contention. The fact that he's using the car for personal trips without contributing to the costs might be seen as unfair.\n\nNext, the boyfriend's behavior: he borrows the car knowing it's not his, uses up the gas, and doesn't refill it despite being asked. He also brushes off the author's concerns and doesn't take responsibility. This pattern of behavior shows a lack of consideration for her financial burden. The author has given warnings, which is reasonable. When he ignores them, she decides to revoke the privilege, which is her right as the car owner.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is also important. Calling her names like juvenile and vindictive suggests he's not taking her concerns seriously. His refusal to pay for gas despite being asked multiple times shows a lack of accountability. The author's actions are a response to his repeated negligence and disrespect for her property and finances.\n\nOn the other hand, one might argue that the boyfriend isn't maliciously trying to take advantage but maybe forgets. However, he's been reminded multiple times and still doesn't comply. That makes the author's decision to stop lending the car justified. She's protecting her own interests, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's anger at her enforcing boundaries could indicate his own immaturity or entitlement.\n\nIn relationships, setting boundaries is important. The author is asserting her boundaries, which is healthy. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here, not her response. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
