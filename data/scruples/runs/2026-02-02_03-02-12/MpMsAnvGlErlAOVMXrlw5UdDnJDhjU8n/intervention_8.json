I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not letting her boyfriend visit his grandma after repeated issues with gas.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend borrowed the car multiple times, each time leaving it with an empty tank. Each trip was a 3.5-hour drive, and the tank could handle the round trip. So he's using a full tank and returning it empty, costing $60 each time. The author is upset because she's covering maintenance, insurance, and gas, which the boyfriend refuses to contribute to since it's not his car. She warned him several times, and after he continued, she decided to stop allowing him to borrow the car. He got angry, accusing her of being vindictive.\n\nFrom my perspective, the boyfriend isn't contributing to the costs he's incurring by using the car. Even though it's her car, he's using a resource she pays for without compensating her. The author had given warnings, which he ignored. She then took action by revoking his access, which seems reasonable given his repeated failures to comply. The boyfriend's reaction of calling her names and dismissing her concerns seems unfair. He should have either filled the tank or offered to pay for the gas. The author isn't being petty; she's standing up for her own financial boundaries. So the answer is B.\n"
