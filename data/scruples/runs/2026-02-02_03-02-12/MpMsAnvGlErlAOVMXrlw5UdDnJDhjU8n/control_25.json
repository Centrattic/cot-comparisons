I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting her boyfriend use her car anymore because he keeps draining the gas without refilling it or contributing to costs. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend and author live together and have been in a relationship for three years. He sold his car when he went to university, so he relies on her car. She pays for maintenance, insurance, and gas, but he refuses to contribute, saying it's not his car. He's taken the car to visit his grandma three times, starting with a full tank and returning it empty. Each time, she's upset, but he just apologizes without fixing the issue. She warned him multiple times that continued behavior would result in losing the privilege.\n\nNow, he wants to take the car again for a weekend trip, and she refuses. He gets angry, calling her names. The question is whether she's in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nSo, the key points here are responsibility and communication. The boyfriend is using a resource (the car and gas) that the author is paying for, but he's not contributing. Even though he's using it for a family visit, which is understandable, the fact that he's not covering the costs or the gas is a problem. The author has clearly communicated her expectations and boundaries, and he's repeatedly failed to meet them. \n\nIn a shared living situation, especially a long-term one, it's reasonable to expect that shared expenses should be split or that those using the resources should contribute. The boyfriend's refusal to pay for gas, despite using it three times, shows a lack of consideration for her financial burden. The author, by setting a boundary and following through when warned, is maintaining her limits. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to be about the principle of being denied access rather than the actual issue of the gas. He's not taking responsibility for his actions and is instead attacking her character, calling her juvenile and vindictive. That suggests poor communication and a lack of accountability on his part. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. She's stood up for her own needs and followed through on her warnings. The boyfriend is the one who's not respecting her boundaries and the financial arrangement. So the answer should be B.\n"
