I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's boyfriend borrows her car to visit his grandmother, but he always takes it with a full tank and returns it empty, costing her money each time. He doesn't pay for the gas or maintenance, even though they live together. The author has warned him multiple times, and now he's upset when she revokes his access to the car.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of the situation. The car is the author's, so she's responsible for the costs. If someone borrows your car and doesn't pay for the gas or maintenance, that's usually considered unfair. The boyfriend isn't contributing financially, which is a point against him. He's also been told multiple times not to do this, yet he keeps doing it. The author is trying to set boundaries, which is reasonable.\n\nThen there's the boyfriend's reaction. He's calling her names like juvenile and vindictive, which is not helpful. He's not taking responsibility for his actions. In relationships, communication is key. The author has given warnings, which she's documented through her words, and he's not responding appropriately. Revoking his access seems like a logical step after repeated infractions.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument that it's not his car might not hold weight because he's using it, so he should bear some of the costs. The fact that he can't even remember to refill the tank after three times shows a lack of consideration. The author is within her rights to decide who uses her property and under what conditions.\n\nSo, the boyfriend is at fault for not contributing and not respecting her boundaries. The author is justified in her actions. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
