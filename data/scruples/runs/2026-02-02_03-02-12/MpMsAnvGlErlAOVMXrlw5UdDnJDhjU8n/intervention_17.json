I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple living together where the boyfriend uses the girlfriend's car to visit his grandma, but doesn't pay for gas or maintenance. The girlfriend is upset about the recurring costs and finally stops allowing him to borrow the car. He reacts negatively, accusing her of being juvenile.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The boyfriend uses the car multiple times, each time draining the gas without replenishing it. The cost adds up (three times at $60 each is $180). The girlfriend has warned him before, but he didn't comply. She decided to stop letting him borrow the car, which he took as a personal attack.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the boyfriend isn't contributing to the car's expenses since he doesn't own it. The girlfriend is covering maintenance, insurance, and gas each time he uses it. It's reasonable for her to expect him to contribute to the gas cost or at least refill it. His repeated failure to do so is a breach of trust and responsibility.\n\nThe girlfriend's response\u2014stopping car access\u2014is a logical consequence given his ongoing behavior. He's upset about being held accountable, calling her names, which shows he's not considering her financial burden. The author's stance is that she's not in the wrong, and I agree. The boyfriend's actions are disrespectful and inconsiderate, making the girlfriend's decision justified.\n"
