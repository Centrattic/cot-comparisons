I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author here is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's boyfriend keeps borrowing her car to visit his grandma, which is 3.5 hours away. Each time he takes the car, he uses all the gas, costing $60 each time, and doesn't refill it. The author has tried to warn him multiple times that if he continues, she won't let him borrow the car anymore. When the boyfriend found out he wasn't allowed to take the car anymore, he got angry and accused her of being vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The car is the author's, she pays for maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend isn't contributing to any of these costs. The trips are long enough that he uses a full tank each trip. He's done this three times, each time leaving the tank empty. The author has given warnings, but he doesn't comply. Now, when she revokes the privilege, he gets upset.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author is the one bearing all the financial responsibility. If someone is using your car and not contributing to the costs, that's a problem. The boyfriend isn't offering to pay for gas, even though he benefits by using the car. The author has set boundaries, but he's not respecting them. The fact that he's using the car for his grandma visits, which is understandable, but the financial aspect isn't being handled properly. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to be dismissive and disrespectful. He's not taking her feelings into account. The author's stance is about fairness and accountability. She's within her rights to set rules about the use of her property. By not refilling the gas, he's not following through on the implicit agreement that if you use something, you maintain it. \n\nThe boyfriend's argument that it's not his car might be true in ownership, but in a relationship where they live together, there's an expectation of shared responsibilities. However, this is her car, and he's using it without contributing. The author's response is a reasonable consequence after repeated infractions. \n\nSo, looking at the situation, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend is failing to respect her property and the agreed-upon terms. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
