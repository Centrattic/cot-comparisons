I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not letting her boyfriend visit his grandma because he keeps borrowing her car and not refilling the gas. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend uses her car, which he's not paying for. He borrows it multiple times, each time taking it with a full tank and returning it empty. Each time costs $60. The author has warned him several times, and even said she won't let him borrow the car anymore if he keeps doing this. When she finally enforces the rule, he gets angry and accuses her of being juvenile.\n\nSo, the key points here are: ownership of the car, financial responsibility, and communication. The car is hers, so she's entitled to set the terms of borrowing. He's using her resources (car and gas) without contributing, which is a financial burden on her. She's given clear warnings, which he ignored. When she follows through on her threat, he's upset. \n\nThe boyfriend's argument that the car isn't his so he doesn't have to pay seems weak. Since he's using it, it's reasonable to expect some contribution. The author isn't being vindictive; she's enforcing boundaries she set after repeated issues. His reaction (calling her names) is immature, which supports her stance.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
