I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a boyfriend who borrowed his partner's car multiple times, never refilled the gas, and the partner finally decides to stop letting him borrow the car. The boyfriend got angry and accused her of being unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend has borrowed the car three times for visits to his grandmother, each time taking it with a full tank and returning it empty. Each tank costs $60. The partner is upset because she's paying for everything, and the boyfriend refuses to contribute, saying it's not his car. She warned him multiple times, but he didn't change his behavior. When she finally stops allowing him to borrow the car, he gets upset and calls her names.\n\nThe main issue here is about fairness and responsibility. The boyfriend is using the car for personal trips but not covering the associated costs. The partner is maintaining the car, paying for insurance, maintenance, and gas, which adds up. The boyfriend's refusal to contribute, even after warnings, seems like a lack of consideration for her financial burden. The partner's response\u2014stopping the car borrowing\u2014seems like a reasonable step to enforce accountability.\n\nHe argues that it's not his car, so he shouldn't have to pay, but he is using a resource that she owns and maintaining it at her expense. His behavior of not refilling the gas despite knowing the cost adds up is inconsiderate. The partner's frustration is justified because she's not getting the respect or fairness she deserves in sharing the car. The boyfriend's reaction of calling her names and dismissing her concerns as grudges shows a lack of empathy and understanding.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the boyfriend is clearly in the wrong for not contributing and for his response. The partner acted to protect her own interests and set boundaries, which is reasonable. So the answer should be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong.\n"
