I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend who borrows the author's car to visit his grandma, but each time he returns it with an empty tank, costing the author money. The author has warned him multiple times, but he keeps doing it. Now, the author refuses to let him use the car anymore, leading to an argument where the boyfriend accuses her of being vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The car is the author's, she pays for everything, and the boyfriend isn't contributing. He uses it but doesn't refill the gas, despite being asked. The author set boundaries after repeated issues, and now he's upset. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The boyfriend is using a car he doesn't own or pay for. The author is within her rights to set rules for borrowing it. If he repeatedly breaks those rules, she's justified in revoking the privilege. The boyfriend's actions are inconsiderate and disrespectful, not paying for gas despite warnings. The author's response is a reasonable consequence. The boyfriend's reaction is about how he feels wronged, but the responsibility lies with him for not following the agreed terms. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the boyfriend isn't aware of the cost, but the author has explained it multiple times. He's been given chances to correct his behavior but hasn't. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
