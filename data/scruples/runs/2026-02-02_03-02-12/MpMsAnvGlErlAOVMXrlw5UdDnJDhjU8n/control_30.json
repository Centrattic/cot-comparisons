I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The main issue is about the boyfriend borrowing the car without refilling the gas or contributing to the costs.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend has used the car multiple times for visits to his grandma, each time draining the gas tank. The cost for a full tank is $60. The user has warned him several times, but he keeps forgetting to refill it and doesn't offer to pay. The user then decides to stop letting him borrow the car, which leads to the boyfriend getting angry and calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nSo, the key points are: the user owns the car, pays for maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend isn't contributing financially, despite the user's warnings. The user took away the privilege because he didn't respect her boundaries. The boyfriend's reaction is seen as disrespectful.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the user is within her rights to set boundaries on her property. The boyfriend is using her resources without contributing, which is a valid reason to restrict access. His anger and name-calling suggest he's not taking her concerns seriously. The user's actions were a direct response to his repeated breaches of agreed-upon terms. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong here.\n"
