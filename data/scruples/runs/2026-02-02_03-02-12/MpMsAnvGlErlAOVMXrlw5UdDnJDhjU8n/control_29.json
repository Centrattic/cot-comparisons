I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation (the author) is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author not allowing her boyfriend to visit his grandmother because he keeps borrowing her car without refilling the gas and not contributing to the costs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The boyfriend lives with her, they've been together three years. He sold his car when he went to university, so he's been using hers. The car is hers, and she's paying for maintenance and insurance. He doesn't contribute because he says \"it's not his car.\" He's been borrowing it to visit his grandma, each time taking it with a full tank and returning it empty. This has happened three times, costing her $60 each time. She's tried to warn him, but he forgets and doesn't offer to pay. Now he wants to take it again, and she's said no. He got upset, called her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's wrong for not letting him take the car anymore. Let's think about responsibilities here. The car is hers, so she's entitled to set the terms for its use. He's using her resources (car and gas) without contributing. Even if he's family, he's an adult and should be responsible for his actions. If he agreed to pay for the gas each time he borrows the car, he should. But he's not doing that. She's given warnings and he's ignored them. Her response is to revoke the privilege, which seems reasonable because he hasn't changed his behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe some might argue that visiting family is important, and he's trying to maintain a relationship with his grandmother. But that's a different perspective. However, the boyfriend's actions are causing financial strain on the author. She's the one bearing all costs, and he's not respecting her boundaries by not following through on refilling gas or paying. His reaction (calling her names) is also important. His response to being denied access is hostile, which is part of the issue.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is trying to hold him accountable. She's given him chances to correct his behavior but he hasn't. Therefore, withholding the car is a logical consequence. The boyfriend is not respecting her property and her financial boundaries. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
