I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation with the boyfriend and the car. The author and her boyfriend live together, and she owns a car that he uses but refuses to pay for. He borrows the car, uses up the gas, and never refills it or contributes to the costs. She's set boundaries and now he's mad when she won't let him use the car anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The car is hers, so she's the one responsible for maintenance, insurance, and gas. Her boyfriend is using it without contributing, which is a financial burden on her. She's given multiple warnings, and he hasn't changed his behavior. The final straw was when he asked to borrow the car again, and she said no, leading to his outburst.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if someone uses a shared resource (like a car in a relationship), it's reasonable to expect shared costs. The boyfriend's refusal to pay for gas and maintenance, despite being asked, is a point against him. The author is setting a boundary to protect her own financial interests, which seems reasonable.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction, calling her juvenile and vindictive, suggests he's not taking responsibility for his actions and is instead blaming her. That's a red flag for poor communication and accountability. The author isn't doing anything wrong by enforcing her boundaries after repeated issues. She's not trying to hold a grudge but is protecting her car and finances.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the boyfriend isn't using the car too much, but three times for his grandma and other trips could add up. Also, since they live together, maybe there's an unspoken agreement for shared use, but it's still clear that he's not contributing. The author is within her rights to stop allowing him to use the car if he's not willing to meet her conditions.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. Her actions are a result of the boyfriend's repeated irresponsibility and her attempts to set reasonable boundaries.\n"
