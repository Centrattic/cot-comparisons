I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend not contributing to car expenses and repeatedly draining the gas without replacing it. The author has warned him multiple times and finally decided to stop letting him borrow the car, leading to an argument where the boyfriend accuses her of being unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The boyfriend is using the car he doesn't own, which he sold when he went to university. The author is paying for maintenance, insurance, and gas. He borrows the car, uses it for trips, and doesn't refill the gas. The author has given warnings, but he keeps doing it. Now, she stops him, and he's upset, calling her names.\n\nThe key points here are responsibility and fairness. The boyfriend is using a resource (the car) that isn't his and isn't contributing financially. The author is covering all costs, which might be unfair to her. The boyfriend's behavior of not refilling the gas is inconsiderate and disrespectful. He's not taking responsibility for his actions despite being warned. The author's decision to stop letting him use the car is a reasonable response to protect her own interests. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be an overreaction, blaming her instead of acknowledging his own faults.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong because she's standing up for her boundaries and financial responsibilities. The boyfriend's actions are the main issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
