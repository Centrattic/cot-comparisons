I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the boyfriend keeps borrowing the girlfriend's car without paying for gas or maintenance, and after repeated warnings, the girlfriend stops allowing him to borrow the car. The boyfriend reacts negatively, and now the author is seeking validation.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The girlfriend has a car she owns and pays for, while the boyfriend is responsible for his own expenses but refuses to contribute since the car isn't his. He borrows the car multiple times, each time leaving it with an empty tank, costing her $60 each time. She's warned him before, and he's ignored it. Now, when he wants to go see his grandma again, she says no, leading to his anger where he calls her names and accuses her of being vindictive.\n\nThe question is whether the author (the girlfriend) is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, when someone borrows something, it's reasonable to expect them to cover the costs incurred. The boyfriend is using the car but not contributing to the fuel, which is a direct expense. The girlfriend is covering the cost, and after repeated issues, she's setting a boundary. The boyfriend's reaction of calling her names and accusing her of holding grudges seems unfair, especially since he's the one who hasn't followed through on his promises to pay for gas.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior shows a lack of consideration for her finances. Even though they live together, the car is hers, and he's not contributing to it. The girlfriend's response is a reasonable consequence after he's failed to meet her expectations despite warnings. His loss of privilege is a direct result of his own actions. The boyfriend's anger seems misplaced because he's the one not fulfilling his part of the agreement.\n\nThere's no indication that the girlfriend is being unreasonable beyond the agreed-upon terms. The boyfriend isn't respecting her property and financial boundaries. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
