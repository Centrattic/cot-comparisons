I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend and the author live together. He sold his car when he went back to university two years ago. She has a car she's paying for, including maintenance and insurance. He refuses to contribute because it's not his car. \n\nHe visits his grandma 3.5 hours away, borrows her car, takes it with a full tank, and returns it empty. Each trip uses a full tank, costing $60. This has happened three times. She's upset because she's paying for the car and gas. He apologizes but doesn't fix the behavior. She warned him multiple times that if it continues, she won't let him borrow the car anymore. Now, he wants to take it again, and she refuses. He gets angry, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nSo, the question is: Is she in the wrong? Answer A or B.\n\nLet me think about the key points. Ownership of the car is hers, so she's responsible for the costs. He's using her car without contributing, which is a valid issue. He's not taking responsibility for the gas, even though he's the one using it. She's setting boundaries, which is reasonable. When he ignores her warnings and then gets upset when she enforces the rules, that's on him. \n\nHe's the one who's not respecting her property and her financial contributions. She's trying to communicate clearly and set limits, which is her right. His reaction seems unfair because he's the one not following through. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. She's standing up for her own resources and setting boundaries after repeated issues. He's the one who's being irresponsible by not maintaining the gas level and refusing to pay. Her response is justified. So the answer should be B.\n"
