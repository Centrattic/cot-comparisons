I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a boyfriend who uses the author's car to visit his grandma, but never refuels it after borrowing it. The author is upset about the cost and the lack of accountability. The boyfriend got angry when the author stopped allowing him to use the car.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The car is the author's, and she's paying for maintenance and insurance. The boyfriend borrows it without contributing to the costs. Each time, he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty, which costs $60 each time. He's done this three times and ignored warnings. The author then revokes the privilege, leading to an argument where the boyfriend accuses her of being juvenile.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author overstepped by stopping the car use. The boyfriend's actions seem inconsiderate. Using someone else's car without contributing to the expenses isn't fair. The author gave multiple warnings, which he ignored. Therefore, her decision to stop lending the car seems justified. The boyfriend's reaction is defensive and dismissive, which isn't helpful. \n\nThe question is about fairness and responsibility. The author is maintaining her property and setting boundaries. The boyfriend isn't respecting those boundaries. There's no indication that the author is unreasonable in her expectations. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
