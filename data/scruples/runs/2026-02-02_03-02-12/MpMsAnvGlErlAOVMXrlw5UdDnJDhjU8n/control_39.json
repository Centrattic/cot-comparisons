I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend who repeatedly borrows the author's car without contributing to gas or maintenance, and now the author is refusing to let him borrow it after multiple warnings.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend has borrowed the car three times to visit his grandma, each time leaving it empty. Each time, the author is upset, but the boyfriend just says sorry and forgets again. The author has warned him multiple times that this behavior would lead to losing the privilege. Finally, when the boyfriend asks again, the author says no, and he gets angry, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nNow, considering fairness. The author owns the car, pays for maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend isn't contributing financially, which seems unfair. The boyfriend's actions are causing the author financial burden each time he uses the car. The author's response is to revoke the access after repeated warnings, which seems reasonable.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is aggressive and dismissive. He's not taking responsibility, just making excuses. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for her own property and financial boundaries. The boyfriend isn't respecting her ownership and the costs involved. So the author's decision to stop allowing him to borrow the car is justified. The boyfriend's anger is misplaced here; he should have considered the costs and contributed or found another solution.\n\nI think the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong. She's protecting her own property and financial interests after repeated issues. The boyfriend's behavior is the problem, not hers.\n"
