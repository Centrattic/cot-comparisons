I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The boyfriend has borrowed the car multiple times, each time using all the gas and not refilling it, costing $60 each time. The author has warned him several times, and now the boyfriend is upset when the author revokes his privilege.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ownership of the car. The car belongs to the author, so they have the right to set the terms for borrowing it. The boyfriend isn't contributing to the maintenance or insurance, which could be seen as unfair since he benefits from using the car without contributing to its costs. The repeated use of gas without reimbursement adds up to a significant expense for the author.\n\nThe boyfriend's response seems dismissive. He brushes off the author's concerns, saying he's sorry but forgetting again. This pattern of behavior shows a lack of consideration. When the author finally takes action, the boyfriend accuses her of being vindictive, which shifts blame onto her. That's not a mature response.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author is protecting their own financial interests. The boyfriend's actions are exploitative, using the car without contributing. The author's decision to stop lending the car is a reasonable consequence after multiple warnings. The boyfriend's reaction suggests he's not taking responsibility for his actions.\n\nI don't see any fault with the author's actions. The boyfriend is the one not respecting boundaries and not contributing his share. The author is justified in enforcing the rules to protect their asset and financial well-being. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
