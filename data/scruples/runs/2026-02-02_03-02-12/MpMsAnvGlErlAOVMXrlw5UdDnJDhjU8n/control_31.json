I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's boyfriend borrowing her car multiple times, not refilling the gas, and not contributing to the costs. The author has tried to address this by saying that if he continues, she won't let him borrow the car anymore. He then got upset, calling her names.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author's actions are justified. The car is hers, she's paying for maintenance and insurance, and he's using it without contributing. Each time he uses it, he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty, costing her $60 each time. He's done this three times and other instances too. She warned him, and he didn't change his behavior. So she stops allowing him to borrow the car. He reacts negatively.\n\nThe key points here are ownership and responsibility. Since the car is hers, she has the right to set the terms for its use. If he's using her resources (gas, maintenance) without contributing, that's unfair. She's within her rights to set boundaries. His reaction seems to be dismissing her concerns and being disrespectful. \n\nThe boyfriend's argument that he's sorry and will remember next time but doesn't follow through shows a pattern of not taking her feelings seriously. The author is trying to enforce her limits, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's outburst and accusations (calling her juvenile, vindictive) indicate he's not respecting her decisions. \n\nIn relationships, both parties should respect each other's property and contribute when necessary. Since the car isn't his, he's not obligated to pay, but using it without consideration is wrong. The author is protecting her own interests, which is valid. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's standing up for herself after repeated issues, and her boyfriend's behavior is the problem here.\n"
