I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in a situation where they're refusing to let their boyfriend use their car anymore because he keeps borrowing it and not refueling it. The boyfriend is upset and called them names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together three years and live together. The boyfriend sold his car when he went to university. The author has their own car that they paid for, including maintenance and insurance. The boyfriend refuses to pay anything for the car because it's not his. \n\nThe grandmother lives 3.5 hours away, and each time he uses the car, he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty. The cost is $60 per tank each time, and this has happened three times. The author is upset because they pay for the gas. The boyfriend apologizes each time but doesn't fix the behavior. The author warned him multiple times that if it continues, they won't let him borrow the car anymore. Now he wants to take it for another trip, and the author says no. He's angry and accused her of being vindictive.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author is justified in refusing him access to the car after repeated instances of not refueling. The boyfriend is not contributing to the car costs, which the author is clearly responsible for. The author has given warnings, and the boyfriend didn't comply. The author's decision to stop allowing him to use the car seems like a logical consequence to prevent further financial burden.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is also a point. He's called the author names, which is a red flag in any relationship. The fact that he's dismissing her concerns and blaming her for holding a grudge suggests he's not taking her feelings seriously. The author is trying to set a boundary, and the boyfriend is reacting negatively to that.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is not at fault here. The boyfriend is using a resource (the car) that the author owns and pays for, without contributing. The author's response is a reasonable step to protect their own interests. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014repeatedly not refueling and not paying\u2014shows a lack of responsibility. The author's action is about enforcing a boundary she's already communicated, so she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend is the one who's not respecting her property and financial contributions.\n"
