I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not letting her boyfriend borrow her car anymore. The boyfriend has a history of borrowing the car, using up the gas without refilling it, and not contributing to the costs. The author has warned him multiple times, but he keeps doing it. Now, when he wants to take the car again, she refuses, and he's upset, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The author is covering all the car's maintenance, insurance, and gas costs. The boyfriend isn't contributing financially, which is a valid point. Using the car without refilling the gas each time adds up to $60 per trip, and this has happened three times. The boyfriend's excuse is that he'll remember next time, but he doesn't. The author has set boundaries, but he's not respecting them, leading her to revoke his access to the car.\n\nThe key points here are responsibility and respect. The boyfriend isn't taking responsibility for his actions, despite multiple warnings. The author is standing her ground, which is reasonable given the financial burden and lack of accountability. The boyfriend's reaction of anger and accusations of being vindictive might indicate that he doesn't see the issue as valid. However, his actions (using the car without contributing and not refilling gas) are the root cause of the conflict.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is justified in protecting her own resources. She has a right to set boundaries, especially when someone else isn't respecting the agreed-upon terms. The boyfriend's failure to follow through on his commitments and his dismissive attitude when confronted likely contribute to the author's decision to stop lending the car. His emotional reaction doesn't negate the fact that he's been warned multiple times and hasn't changed his behavior.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's taking a stand after repeated violations of trust and financial responsibility. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here, not the author's response to it. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
