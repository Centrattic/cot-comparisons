I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not letting her boyfriend visit his grandma because he keeps draining her car's gas without refilling or contributing to costs.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend uses the car multiple times for trips, each time leaving it empty. The car is the author's, and she's responsible for all costs. He refuses to pay anything because it's \"not his car.\" She's given warnings and now revoked his privilege. He gets angry, calling her names. The question is if she's in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider fairness in shared responsibilities. Even though they're a couple, the car is hers. He's using it without contributing, which is unfair. The cost adds up (three times at $60 each is $180). She's given him chances to correct his behavior but he didn't. Her response is to stop letting him use the car, which is a reasonable consequence given he's not respecting her property. His reaction (calling her names) is inappropriate. \n\nThe key points are ownership, contribution, and previous warnings. Since he's not contributing and she's followed up with action, she's justified. The answer is B.\n"
