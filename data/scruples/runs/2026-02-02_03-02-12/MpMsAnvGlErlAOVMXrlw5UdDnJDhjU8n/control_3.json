I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a boyfriend not contributing to car expenses or gas, and the author not allowing him to borrow the car anymore after multiple times of him not refilling the tank.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The couple lives together, they've been together three years. The boyfriend sold his car when he went to university. The car they use now belongs to the author, who pays for maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend borrows the car to visit his grandma, 3.5 hours away, and each time he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty. The tank cost is $60, and this has happened three times. The author has warned him multiple times, but he keeps doing it. Now, when he asks to take the car again for a day trip, the author refuses, leading to an argument where he accuses her of being juvenile.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about fairness. The author is responsible for all the car's costs, and the boyfriend isn't contributing. Each time he uses the car, he's using up gas but not paying for it. The author is trying to set boundaries after repeated failures from the boyfriend to comply. The boyfriend's response is defensive and dismissive, not taking responsibility, and even accusing the author of being in the wrong.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if someone is using a shared resource (the car) but not contributing to its costs, the person who owns it is justified in setting boundaries. The boyfriend's refusal to pay for the gas he uses is a key point here. The author has given multiple warnings, but the boyfriend ignores them, leading her to stop allowing him to use the car. That seems like a reasonable consequence for not respecting previous agreements.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of calling her juvenile and holding grudges is misplaced, as the author is acting in her own interest to protect her property and expenses. There's no indication that the author is being unreasonable beyond the boyfriend's repeated failures to meet his responsibilities. Therefore, the author's actions are justified, and the boyfriend is the one not respecting her property and financial contributions.\n"
