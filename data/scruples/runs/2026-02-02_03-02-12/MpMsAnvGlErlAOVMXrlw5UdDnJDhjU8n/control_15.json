I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the situation) is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend who borrows the author's car to visit his grandma, but each time he returns it with the gas tank empty. The author has asked him multiple times to refill the gas or pay for it, but he's not doing it. The boyfriend ends up getting angry when the author revokes his permission to borrow the car again.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the fairness of the situation. The author is paying for the car's maintenance, insurance, and gas, which are significant expenses. The boyfriend isn't contributing financially, which is a point of contention. The boyfriend's actions of not refilling the gas tank after borrowing the car for trips, despite being asked, show a lack of consideration for the shared expenses. \n\nThe boyfriend's response when confronted is to accuse the author of being juvenile and holding grudges, which seems dismissive of the actual issue. The author's decision to stop allowing car usage is a consequence for ongoing irresponsible behavior. The boyfriend's anger might stem from not wanting to face the consequence, but the author's stance is about fairness in shared responsibilities.\n\nConsidering all this, the boyfriend isn't taking responsibility for his part in the expenses and is not respecting the author's boundaries. The author's response is a reasonable attempt to enforce accountability. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
