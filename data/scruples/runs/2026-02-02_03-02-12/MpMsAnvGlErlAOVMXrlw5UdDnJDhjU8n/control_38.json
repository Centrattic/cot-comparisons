I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girlfriend not letting her boyfriend use her car because he hasn't paid for gas or maintenance. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend uses her car three times to visit his grandma, each time draining the gas and not refilling it. The cost adds up, and she's upset because he's not contributing. He dismisses her concerns, apologizes but doesn't change his behavior. She threatens to stop letting him use the car, which he takes as a big deal, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive. Now she's cutting off access to the car, and he's upset.\n\nSo the question is, is she wrong for doing that? Let's break down the key points. The car is hers, she pays for everything. He's using it without contributing, even after being warned. She has a right to set boundaries on her own property. He's not respecting her rules and not taking her concerns seriously. He's also making derogatory comments about her, which shows poor communication. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, if he uses her car, he should help with the costs, especially since it's necessary for his trips. She's given multiple chances and he's failed to comply. Her decision to stop letting him use the car is a consequence he's been warned about. His reaction is over the top and dismissive of her feelings. \n\nLegally and ethically, she owns the car, so she can set the terms. He's violating those terms repeatedly. Her actions are a reasonable response to his ongoing negligence. He's the one not respecting her property and financial contributions. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong). She's standing up for her rights and enforcing the rules she's set. His behavior is the issue here.\n"
