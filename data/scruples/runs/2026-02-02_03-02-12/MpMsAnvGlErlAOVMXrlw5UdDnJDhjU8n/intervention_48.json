I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple living together where the boyfriend borrows the author's car to visit his grandma, but never refuels it, costing the author money each time. The author has warned him multiple times and eventually stopped letting him borrow the car, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend is using the author's car, which the author owns and maintains. Even though they live together, the car is clearly the author's responsibility financially. The boyfriend isn't contributing to the costs, which is a key point. The fact that he takes the car for trips that require gas, and doesn't refill it, is a repeated issue. The author gave warnings, which the boyfriend ignored, leading to the author's decision to stop allowing the car's use. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is another factor. He accuses the author of being juvenile and vindictive, but the author's actions are based on the boyfriend's irresponsible behavior. The boyfriend not only didn't follow through on promises to refill the gas but also didn't offer to compensate the author for the costs. This seems like a lack of consideration and accountability. \n\nThe author's decision to stop letting him use the car is a reasonable response to prevent ongoing financial burden and to set boundaries. The boyfriend's frustration in the argument doesn't negate the author's right to enforce those boundaries. There's no indication that the author is being unfair or petty; rather, they're standing up for their own property and financial responsibilities. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is justified in their actions and not in the wrong.\n"
