I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend using the author's car to visit his grandma, but consistently not refilling the gas. The car is the author's, they pay for everything, and the boyfriend refuses to contribute. The author has given warnings and finally revoked the car borrowing privilege, leading to an argument where the boyfriend accuses her of being vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ownership of the car. The car is the author's, so she has the right to set rules about its use. The boyfriend is using it without contributing to costs, which seems unfair. Gas is expensive, and he's not replacing the full tank each time. The author has tried to communicate her concerns and set boundaries, but he keeps ignoring them. When she finally takes away the privilege, he reacts negatively, calling her names and not taking her feelings into account.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior seems inconsiderate. He's not respecting her property or her financial situation. The author is within her rights to stop him from using the car if he's not following the agreed terms. The boyfriend's response\u2014calling her juvenile and holding grudges\u2014doesn't address the actual issue but instead deflects blame. That suggests he's not taking her concerns seriously, which is a red flag in a relationship. \n\nThe key points here are ownership, financial responsibility, and communication. The author isn't at fault for standing up for her rights. The boyfriend is the one who's not respecting those boundaries. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
