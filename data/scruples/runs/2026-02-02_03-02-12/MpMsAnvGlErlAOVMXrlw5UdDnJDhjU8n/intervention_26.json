I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend who's been borrowing the author's car repeatedly without contributing to gas or maintenance, and the author finally decides to stop letting him borrow the car after multiple warnings.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend uses the car three times to visit his grandmother, each time taking it with a full tank and returning it empty. Each trip costs $60 in gas. The author has warned him multiple times that if this continues, the car is no longer available. The boyfriend then plans another trip, and the author revokes the permission, leading to an argument where the boyfriend accuses the author of being unfair.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is justified in revoking the car use. The boyfriend hasn't paid for anything related to the car, which is the author's personal property. The author is responsible for maintenance, insurance, and gas costs. The boyfriend's behavior is consistent\u2014each time he uses the car, he doesn't replenish the gas, despite being asked. The author has made it clear that if this continues, they won't allow it anymore. When the boyfriend tries to do it again, the author follows through on the warning.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the author is standing up for their own property and financial responsibilities. The boyfriend is using a resource he doesn't own without contributing. The author's response seems reasonable given the repeated breaches of trust. The boyfriend's reaction is angry and dismissive, which might indicate he's not taking the author's concerns seriously. The author isn't being vindictive; they've given multiple chances and finally took action when the rules weren't respected.\n\nPossible counterarguments could be that the boyfriend might not have the means to contribute, but there's no mention of that in the background. The author has provided him with a means to visit family, which is a valid need, but at a cost the author is bearing. The boyfriend's refusal to pay for gas after being asked is a clear boundary violation. The author's decision to stop lending the car is a logical consequence after repeated offenses.\n\nThe boyfriend's accusations of being juvenile or vindictive seem unfounded because the author is enforcing previously communicated boundaries. The boyfriend is in the wrong for not respecting the author's property and financial responsibilities. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong here.\n"
