I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author (the person asking) is in the wrong for not letting their boyfriend visit his grandma because he keeps draining the gas and not paying for it.\n\nFirst, the background: They live together, have been in a relationship for three years. The boyfriend sold his car when he went back to university two years ago. The author has a car they pay for, including maintenance and insurance. The boyfriend refuses to contribute because it's not his car. He borrows the car, uses all the gas, and doesn't refill it. This has happened three times, costing $60 each time. The author has warned him multiple times that if this continues, they'll stop letting him borrow the car. Then, when he asks again, she says no, and he gets angry, calling her names. Now, the question is if she's at fault.\n\nHmm. So, the boyfriend is using someone else's car without contributing to the expenses. The car is the author's responsibility. Each trip uses a full tank, and he doesn't refill it, leading to repeated costs. The author has tried to warn him, but he ignores the warnings. Then, when she enforces the rule, he reacts badly. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, using someone else's car and not covering the gas costs seems unfair. If you borrow a car, it's reasonable to expect the borrower to cover the fuel they use. The boyfriend's refusal to pay or refill the tank is a problem. The author is trying to set a boundary to protect her own expenses. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is also a red flag. He's being defensive, not taking responsibility, and reacting with anger instead of understanding. The author's actions are about setting a boundary after repeated issues. She gave multiple warnings, which he didn't heed, so her final decision to stop allowing him to borrow the car is a logical consequence. \n\nSo, she's not in the wrong for enforcing her own rules after he's been careless with her property and expenses. Her stance is reasonable. The boyfriend's behavior is the main issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
