I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The main issue is about the boyfriend borrowing the car and not refilling the gas. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend lives with the author and uses her car, which she owns. He's been borrowing it multiple times, leaving it empty each time. The cost adds up, especially with the 60$ per tank for a 3.5-hour trip. The author has warned him multiple times, but he doesn't follow through. When she finally takes away the privilege, he gets upset and accuses her of being vindictive.\n\nSo, the key points here are responsibility and fairness. The car is the author's, so she should have the right to set boundaries. The boyfriend is not contributing to the costs (gas, insurance, maintenance) and is ignoring her warnings. The author is trying to enforce her rules, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be about his own feelings rather than addressing the actual issue. \n\nHe's been given multiple chances to change his behavior, but he hasn't. The author's decision to stop allowing the car is a logical consequence. The boyfriend's accusations of being juvenile or vindictive don't hold water because he's the one not respecting her property and financial contributions. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. She's standing up for her rights and the financial aspects she's responsible for. The boyfriend's behavior is the problem here.\n"
