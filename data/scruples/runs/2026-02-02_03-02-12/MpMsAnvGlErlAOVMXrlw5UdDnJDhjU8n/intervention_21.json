I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not allowing her boyfriend to borrow her car anymore. The boyfriend has borrowed the car multiple times, each time taking it with a full tank and returning it empty. The author is upset about the gas costs, which add up to $60 each time. She's asked him to pay for maintenance and insurance, but he refuses because \"it's not his car.\" After several instances, she's decided to stop letting him borrow the car, which led to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness here. The boyfriend is using the author's car and gas, which he's not contributing to. Even though he's family, using someone's resources without contributing financially could be seen as unfair. The author has given multiple warnings, which he ignored. She's within her rights to set boundaries, especially with her own property.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that he's entitled to visit his grandmother, but that doesn't absolve him of responsibility for the costs. The author's main issue is the repeated failure to refill the gas and the refusal to pay for maintenance. The boyfriend's reaction of calling her juvenile and vindictive seems out of proportion if he's aware of the prior warnings. \n\nThe key points are the repeated use without contribution and the lack of respect for her boundaries. The author's decision to revoke the car use is a logical consequence after multiple breaches. So, she's not in the wrong for enforcing her rules.\n"
