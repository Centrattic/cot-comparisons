I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend who borrows the author's car to visit his grandmother, but each time he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty, costing the author money. The author has warned him multiple times that if this continues, she'll stop letting him borrow the car. When he asks to borrow the car again, she says no, and he gets angry, accusing her of being juvenile and holding grudges.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author owns the car, pays for maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend uses the car without contributing financially. The author has given clear warnings and followed through on her decision when the behavior continues. The boyfriend's response is anger and accusations.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author is justified in expecting some responsibility from her partner, especially since they live together. The boyfriend's refusal to contribute to the car's costs and his repeated failure to refill the gas are problematic. The author's decision to stop lending the car is a reasonable consequence after multiple warnings. His reaction seems dismissive and disrespectful, which complicates the situation.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument that it's \"not his car\" might not hold weight since they live together and share expenses. The author has every right to set boundaries regarding her property. The boyfriend's behavior appears inconsiderate, and the author's response is proportionate. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong here.\n"
