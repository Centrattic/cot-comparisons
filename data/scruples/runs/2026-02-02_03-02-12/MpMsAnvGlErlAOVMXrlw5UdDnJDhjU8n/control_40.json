I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting her boyfriend borrow her car anymore. The boyfriend has borrowed the car multiple times, each time leaving it with an empty tank, costing $60 each time. The author has warned him several times, but he keeps forgetting to refill it or pay for it. Now she's decided to stop letting him borrow the car, and he's upset, calling her names.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend is using the author's car without contributing to the costs. Even though he's a partner, he's not paying for maintenance or insurance. That itself might be a point of contention. When he borrows the car, he's using the gas, which is a direct expense the author is covering without his contribution. She's given multiple warnings, which he's ignored, leading her to revoke the privilege. \n\nIs the author wrong for doing that? Well, she owns the car and has the right to set boundaries. The boyfriend's behavior is inconsiderate and financially burdensome. By not replenishing the gas, he's adding a cost to her. Even if it's a relationship, she's within her rights to decide who can use her property and under what conditions. His reaction, where he accuses her of being vindictive, seems unfair. He's the one not respecting her rules. \n\nBut maybe there's a nuance. Could there be a miscommunication? The boyfriend might feel entitled to use the car since they live together. However, the author clearly set boundaries which he repeatedly broke. She's acting within her rights to enforce those. The boyfriend's response is more about deflection than addressing the issue. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's protecting her financial interests and enforcing her rules. The boyfriend's actions are the problematic part here. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
