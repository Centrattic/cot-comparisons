I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend who uses the author's car to visit his grandmother and other things, but never refuels it after borrowing it. The car was sold by the boyfriend when he went to university, and the author is the one paying for maintenance and insurance. The boyfriend has taken the car three times to see his grandma, each time using up a full tank of gas (costing $60 each time) and not replacing it. The author has warned him multiple times, and now he wants to take the car again on the weekend when she's at work, but she refuses. He gets angry, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author is wrong for not allowing her boyfriend to use her car anymore. Let's break it down. The boyfriend is using her car without contributing to the costs. Even though he says it's not his car, he's benefitting from its use. The author is clearly the owner, so it's her responsibility to maintain the car, including gas. The boyfriend's actions are causing financial burden on her. She's given multiple warnings and he hasn't changed his behavior. Therefore, when he asks again, she's cutting him off, which seems fair because he hasn't respected her boundaries. His reaction is also poor\u2014he's angry and blaming her instead of taking responsibility.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument might be that he's using the car for family visits, which are important. However, he's responsible for the gas cost each time he uses it. The author isn't stopping him from visiting his grandma; she's stopping him from using her car without contributing. It's about fairness and responsibility. The boyfriend's refusal to pay or refuel is the root of the problem. The author is within her rights to revoke the privilege since he's not respecting her terms. His anger is misplaced; it's the author's car and her rules. There's no indication that she's being unreasonable beyond the agreed-upon terms. The boyfriend should have taken responsibility by either paying for the gas or not using the car. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong here.\n"
