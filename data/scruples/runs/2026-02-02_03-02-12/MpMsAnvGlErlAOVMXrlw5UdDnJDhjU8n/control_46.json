I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the boyfriend and his girlfriend live together, have been for three years. The boyfriend sold his car when he went back to university two years ago, and now uses the girlfriend's car. She's the one paying for maintenance, insurance, and gas. He refuses to pay anything because it's not his car. The issue is that he borrows the car to visit his grandma 3.5 hours away, and each time he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty. It costs her $60 per trip. She's been upset, warned him multiple times, and after three incidents, she decided to stop letting him borrow the car. He got angry, called her names, said she was holding grudges.\n\nSo, first, the boyfriend is using her car without contributing to the costs. That's a point. He's using the car for trips that are significant in distance, leading to higher gas consumption. Since the car is hers, he's not paying for gas or maintenance. The fact that the car can make the trip on a full tank but he still returns it empty suggests he's not even trying to manage the gas properly. She's given multiple warnings, and he keeps doing it. Then when she enforces the rule, he's upset and blames her.\n\nNow, from a fairness perspective, if someone is using a shared resource (the car), they should share the costs. Even though he doesn't own the car, using it for his personal trips should involve some contribution. But he's not doing that. The fact that he's not even putting gas back is another issue. The girlfriend is covering all expenses, which might be unfair if the usage is significant.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is also a problem. After being warned, he's still not changing his behavior. When she takes action, he accuses her of being vindictive. That's a red flag in communication. She's trying to set boundaries, and he's reacting with anger and blame, which isn't healthy.\n\nSo, the author's decision to stop letting him borrow the car is a reasonable response after repeated infractions. He's not respecting her property and her financial contributions. The boyfriend is in the wrong for not contributing and for his reaction. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
