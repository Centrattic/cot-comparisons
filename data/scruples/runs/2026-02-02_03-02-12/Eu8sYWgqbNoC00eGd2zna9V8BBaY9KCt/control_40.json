I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is about a Domme (a dominant in a BDSM context) and a sub who didn't pay after the session because the Domme ignored his safe word.\n\nFirst, the user set up a session where he paid a $50 deposit for a $350 session. He communicated his limits as medium power ballbusting max. The safe word system was using a ball in his hand; if he dropped it, she was supposed to stop. But during the session, the Domme went beyond his agreed limits, kept hitting even after he dropped the ball (the safe word), causing severe pain and injury. He didn't pay the remaining $300, and the Domme is threatening to tell the community he didn't pay.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. In BDSM, consent and safety are paramount. Safe words are supposed to be respected always. The Domme here didn't respect the safe word, went beyond the agreed limits, and caused harm. That's a serious breach of trust and safety. The user was injured and went to the hospital. The friend who's a Domme says he should have paid despite the issues, but that seems to ignore the safety violation.\n\nLegally, maybe there's an argument about services rendered, but ethically, the Domme failed her duty to follow the agreed terms. The user had the right to withhold payment when his safety was compromised, especially since the Domme didn't adhere to the safe word protocol. Also, the broken restraints were her responsibility because they were part of the session setup. So the user isn't in the wrong for not paying under these circumstances.\n"
