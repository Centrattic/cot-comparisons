I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a Domme session where the author didn't pay after the Domme ignored their safe word. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the details. The author set up a session for $350, paid a $50 deposit upfront. The Domme didn't ask for the full payment before the session. They agreed on the safe word being dropping a ball, which the author did, but the Domme continued the activity, leading to injury. The author then refused to pay the remaining $300, and the Domme is threatening to inform the community.\n\nNow, the key points here are the safe word and the contract. The safe word is crucial in BDSM to stop the activity immediately. If the Domme ignored the safe word, that's a serious breach of agreed-upon safety. The author's actions (not paying) might be seen as a result of the Domme not following the rules. \n\nBut then, the author's friend, who's also a Domme, says the author is in the wrong because they should pay regardless. The friend argues that pushing limits is part of the role, and breaking equipment is the client's fault. However, in a consensual power exchange, the Domme is supposed to respect the safeword. If the Domme didn't honor it, that's a failure in their role. \n\nAlso, the author didn't pay the full amount upfront, which is common in such services. The Domme might not have a claim to the money since the service wasn't completed properly. The injury adds another layer; the client suffered because the Domme didn't stop when the safe word was triggered. Legally and ethically, the Domme is at fault here. \n\nSo, the author's refusal to pay is justified because the Domme violated the agreed safety protocols, leading to injury. The author's actions are a response to the Domme's negligence. The friend's argument that the author should pay might be based on the expectation that the client must always pay, but in reality, if the service was not performed as agreed (i.e., ignoring the safeword), the client isn't obligated to pay the rest. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
