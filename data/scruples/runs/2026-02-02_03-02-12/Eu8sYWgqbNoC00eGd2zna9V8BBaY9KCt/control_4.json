I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. So, the situation is about a Domme (dominant in a BDSM context) who the author hired for a session. The author agreed on a safe word protocol, which involved holding a ball and dropping it if they needed to stop. The Domme, however, ignored the safe word after the author dropped the ball, continued with more intense actions beyond what was agreed, leading to the author going to the hospital. Now, the Domme is upset about not being paid in full and the broken restraints, and the author is considering not paying her.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the principles of consensual adult activities, especially in contexts like BDSM where safety and consent are paramount. The key points here are the use of a safe word and the consequences of ignoring it. Safe words are supposed to be respected by all parties involved to ensure that the sub can stop the activity at any time without fear. If the Domme ignored the safe word, that violates the agreed-upon boundaries and could be considered a breach of trust and safety.\n\nThe author dropped the ball as per their agreed safe word, and the Domme didn't stop. Then the author broke the restraints to protect themselves. The Domme is now claiming that the author is in the wrong because the author didn't pay for the session and broke her equipment. But the author argues that the Domme endangered their health and ignored the safe word, so they don't owe the remaining money.\n\nIn consensual activities, especially paid ones, both parties must honor the agreed terms. If the Domme didn't follow the safe word protocol, the author could have a valid reason for withholding payment. However, the author did agree to the session and the payment terms, so not paying might complicate things. But the main issue is the safe word being ignored, which is a serious matter. If the author was genuinely in distress and the Domme didn't stop, that's a problem. The author's actions to protect themselves (breaking the restraints) might be understandable given the pain.\n\nAlso, the friend's opinion that the author is an asshole for not paying is another angle. But the friend might not be considering the safety violation aspect. The Domme's claim about losing money due to the broken restraints might be valid, but if she didn't follow the safe word, the responsibility could be on her for causing the damage. The author was in a vulnerable position and had to take action to avoid further harm, which might justify not paying the full amount, especially if the session wasn't completed as agreed or posed a risk to health.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for not paying because the Domme violated the agreed-upon safety protocol. The safe word should have been respected, and the author's priority was to stop the activity for their safety, which is the main reason such protocols exist. The non-payment is a result of the Domme's failure to adhere to the terms, so the author isn't at fault. Answer B.\n"
