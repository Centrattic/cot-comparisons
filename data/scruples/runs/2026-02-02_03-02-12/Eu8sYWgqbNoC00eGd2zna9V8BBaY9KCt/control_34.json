I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not paying a domme after she ignored their safe word during a session. The situation involves a consensual power exchange, but there's a problem here. \n\nFirst, the author set up a safe word system where dropping the ball would signal the domme to stop immediately. But when the author dropped the ball, the domme didn't stop. That's a big deal because safe words are supposed to be non-negotiable in such scenarios. The domme's failure to honor the safe word could be seen as negligence or even assault, depending on the circumstances.\n\nThe author had agreed to a medium level of intensity, but the domme went beyond that, causing severe pain. The fact that the domme continued after the safe word was triggered is a breach of trust and safety. The author was in a vulnerable position and couldn't stop the session themselves, so relying on the domme to stop was right.\n\nThe domme then accused the author of breaking her equipment and demanded payment. But since the domme didn't follow the agreed-upon safety measures, the author has a valid reason to not pay. The friend's opinion that the author is an asshole might be from a domme's perspective, but the key issue here is the violation of the safe word. \n\nIn consensual activities, the bottom's safety and comfort are paramount. The domme's responsibility is to ensure that the session stays within the agreed limits. By ignoring the safe word, she didn't fulfill her duty, and the author isn't obligated to pay for a session that was conducted unsafely. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They had a legitimate reason to not pay and to seek medical attention. The domme's actions were negligent, and the author's refusal to pay stems from her failure to adhere to the safety protocols they both agreed upon.\n"
