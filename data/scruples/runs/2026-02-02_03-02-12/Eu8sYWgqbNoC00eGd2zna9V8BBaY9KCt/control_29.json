I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a Domme who didn't stop when the safe word was triggered during a ballbusting session, leading to the author not paying for the session afterward.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a safe word is. I think in contexts like this, a safe word is a pre-agreed signal that allows someone to stop or pause the activity if they feel unsafe or in pain. The author mentioned that the safe word was dropping a ball, and when he did that, the Domme didn't stop. That seems like a serious breach of trust and safety protocols. \n\nThe author paid a deposit and agreed on the intensity, but the Domme exceeded the agreed-upon limits, which caused significant pain and led to an injury. The Domme then refused to refund the remaining money and even threatened to report him to the community for non-payment. The author's friend, another domme, is suggesting he should have paid anyway, but that seems contradictory to the principles of consent and safety in such activities.\n\nIn consensual power exchange dynamics, respecting the sub's safe word and limits is paramount. If the Domme didn't adhere to that, she's violating the established boundaries. The author's decision to not pay could be justified because the service wasn't provided as agreed. Also, the fact that the Domme continued after the safe word was triggered is a major issue. \n\nHowever, there's a part where the author broke the restraints, which might be considered an accident under extreme stress. The Domme's response to that by yelling and demanding payment despite her own failure to follow safety protocols could be seen as unfair. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, while the contract was verbal, the failure to adhere to the agreed terms (especially the safe word) might void the obligation to pay. The author's health was compromised, which adds weight to his side. The Domme's threats of community backlash could be considered harassment or intimidation. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because the Domme failed to uphold the agreed-upon safety measures, leading to harm and justified refusal to pay. The answer should be B.\n"
