I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author paid a deposit of $50 for a $350 session with a domme. They discussed limits, specifically medium power max for ballbusting. The domme used restraints and a ball gag. The safe word was dropping a ball, which the author did after 20 minutes, but the domme didn't stop. She continued with more force, leading to the author almost passing out and breaking the restraint. The domme then yelled at him for breaking her equipment and demanded the remaining $300. The author refused to pay, went to the hospital, and later got a friend's opinion, who said the author was an asshole for not paying.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the agreement made before the session. They discussed limits, and the author specified medium power max. The domme didn't adhere to that, escalating beyond agreed terms. The safe word system was clearly in place, but when the author used it (by dropping the ball), the domme didn't stop. This is a fundamental issue in any consensual power exchange scenario. Ignoring the safe word and exceeding agreed limits is a serious breach of trust and safety protocols.\n\nThe author then suffered significant pain and injury, which led to a medical check-up. The domme's actions resulted in harm, so the author's refusal to pay could be justified on the grounds that the service was not as agreed and caused injury. However, the domme might argue that the session was ongoing and the author didn't use a specific verbal safe word. But in this case, the safe word was a physical action (dropping the ball), which the author did. If that's part of the pre-agreed communication method, then the domme's failure to recognize it is on her.\n\nThe domme also mentions that the author broke her equipment, which might be a point of contention. But if the equipment was broken because she didn't follow the agreed limits and caused the author to thrash in pain, then the domme is at fault for the damage. The author's friend, being a domme, suggested the author was in the wrong, which is a bit confusing. Maybe her perspective is that once the session starts, you pay regardless, but that's not considering the harm caused and the breach of the agreed terms.\n\nIn consensual kink, the dominant is supposed to prioritize the sub's limits and safety. Ignoring the safe word and causing injury violates that principle. The author's decision to not pay after the harm is a response to the domme's negligence. Legally, if the author was injured due to the domme's failure to follow agreed terms, there might be some liability issues. But in terms of right or wrong, the domme's actions definitely crossed the line. The author had the right to stop the session when he was in pain and not pay for a service that was harmful and not as agreed. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
