I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not paying the Domme after she ignored his safe word. So, the scenario is about a consensual power exchange scenario where the Domme didn't respect the safe word, leading to injury.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a safe word is. A safe word is a pre-agreed word or signal that allows a person to stop the activity immediately. If the Domme ignored the safe word, that's a breach of the agreed terms. The author used a physical safe word (holding a ball) and dropped it, which was supposed to make her stop. But she continued, causing harm. \n\nThe Domme charged for the session but didn't receive payment. The author argues that because the safe word was ignored, he's not paying. His friend, another domme, says he's an asshole for not paying. But the key here is whether the service was performed as agreed. If the Domme didn't follow the agreed terms (safe word), then the service wasn't delivered properly. The author isn't obligated to pay for a service that was not provided as agreed. \n\nAlso, the Domme damaged his equipment, which he didn't pay for. The author might even have a case for damaged property if he's suing, but that's separate. The main issue is the agreement. The Domme didn't fulfill her part (respecting the safe word), so the author isn't in the wrong for not paying. \n\nAnother angle: in consensual kink, safety is paramount. The Domme's actions were negligent. The author prioritized his health, which is the right choice. The friend's perspective is more about payment regardless, but that's missing the point of the broken agreement. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He set boundaries that were violated, leading to injury. Not paying is justified as the service was not properly delivered.\n"
