I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person in this scenario is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe person set up a session with a dominatrix, paid a deposit, and agreed on a safeword. The dominatrix didn't stop when the safeword was triggered, leading to the person being injured. They didn't pay the remaining fee and the domme is upset, even threatening to report them. The friend, who's also a domme, says the author is at fault for not paying and breaking the equipment.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the safeword not being respected. In any consensual power exchange, especially in kink activities, safewords are crucial for safety. The domme ignored the safeword, which is a breach of trust and safety. The person was hurt and went to the hospital, which shows the severity. \n\nThe deposit was $50 for a $350 session. They didn't pay the remaining $300 because the domme didn't follow the agreed-upon terms. The friend's argument is that the domme pushed limits, which is part of the role, but that's a risky justification if it leads to harm. The person's main issue is that their safeword was ignored, leading to injury. \n\nSo, in terms of ethics, the person isn't at fault for not paying because the service was not delivered as agreed, especially with a critical safety violation. The domme's actions were negligent. The person's choice to prioritize their health over paying the fee is understandable. The threat from the domme also adds to the justification, as it's a form of coercion. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
