I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a Domme session where the client didn't pay after the Domme ignored his safe word.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The client paid a deposit, set a safe word (holding a ball), and agreed on medium power. The Domme went beyond the agreed intensity, ignored the safe word when he dropped the ball, caused him significant pain, and then demanded payment. He refused to pay the remaining amount and was threatened with reputation damage in the community.\n\nThe Domme's defense from a friend is that she pushed his limits, which is part of the role. But the client felt endangered and injured. The main issue here is whether the Domme violated the agreed terms by ignoring the safe word, leading to harm, and if the client is wrong for not paying under those circumstances.\n\nIn consensual power exchange scenarios, safety words are crucial. If the Domme ignored the safe word, which was a clear signal to stop, that's a breach of trust and safety. The client's refusal to pay could be justified because the service was not provided as agreed, and he was harmed. The Domme's actions went beyond the agreed limits, making her responsible for the harm caused. The client's decision not to pay might be seen as a response to the negligence. However, some might argue that payment is still required as per the original agreement regardless of the incident. But given that the Domme violated the safe word and caused injury, the client is likely not at fault for not paying. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
