I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a Domme and a submissive, paying for a session, and a safeword issue.\n\nFirst, the author agreed to a session and paid a $50 deposit. The Domme didn't ask for the full payment upfront, which is unusual but not necessarily a problem. The author set limits on the intensity of ballbusting, saying medium max. The Domme agreed but then exceeded that by using restraints and a ball gag, and continued with powerful kicks even after the safe word was triggered (dropping the ball). The author got seriously injured, went to the hospital, and refused to pay the remaining $300. The Domme is threatening to report the author to the community for non-payment and equipment damage.\n\nKey points to consider: Safeword protocols are crucial in these activities. The safe word is supposed to stop everything immediately, but the Domme ignored it. The author was in excruciating pain, leading to a possible injury. The Domme continued after the safe word, which is a major breach of trust and safety. The author's refusal to pay could be seen as a response to non-compliance with agreed-upon boundaries. The friend who is a Domme says the author is an asshole for not paying, but that's from her perspective, possibly not considering the safety violation.\n\nLegally and ethically, if the Domme didn't follow the agreed safe word, the author might have a valid reason to withhold payment. However, the author had already paid a deposit. But the main issue is the safety violation. The Domme's actions could lead to legal consequences if she didn't stop upon the safe word. The author's decision not to pay the remaining amount might be justified if the service was not provided as agreed and caused harm. The friend's opinion that the author is wrong might be biased, as she's part of the Domme community and could prioritize payment over safety.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), because the Domme violated the agreed safe word, leading to injury, which is the Domme's fault. The author is justified in not paying the rest of the fee due to the breach of safety protocols, even if they had a deposit.\n"
