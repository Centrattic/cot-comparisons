I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this step by step. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a consensual power exchange scenario where the domme (dominant) ignored the sub's safe word, leading to injury.\n\nFirst, the key points here are consent and safety. The user set up a session with clear boundaries, including a safe word (the ball) that he drops when the pain becomes too much. The domme, however, continued past that safe word, causing significant harm. The user refused to pay because the domme violated the agreed-upon terms, leading to a conflict where the domme threatens to report him to the community for non-payment.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether the user is at fault for not paying. The domme's actions were a breach of the agreed-upon safety measures. In any consensual arrangement, especially in activities where safety is paramount, the agreed-upriority and communication are crucial. The domme's failure to respect the safe word and pushing beyond the user's stated limits (medium power max) when he clearly indicated he was in pain and dropped the ball (safe word) shows a lack of adherence to the negotiated terms. This is a serious issue because it endangered the user's well-being.\n\nThe user's response was to not pay, which is a direct consequence of the domme's violation of the agreed-upon terms. The user's friend, another domme, is critical and says he should have paid, but that seems to miss the point. The domme's actions were negligent and violated the trust and safety protocols, which are fundamental in such arrangements. The user's priority was to seek medical attention, which is a reasonable response given the injury.\n\nThe domme's retaliation by threatening to report the user for non-payment seems vindictive, especially since she was the one who failed to uphold the agreed-upon safety measures. Her claim about losing money from broken equipment is secondary to the primary issue of her negligence causing harm. In any service agreement, the provider is responsible for not causing harm through negligence. The user's decision to not pay is justified because the service was not provided as agreed, and it resulted in injury.\n\nTherefore, the user is not in the wrong for not paying. The domme was at fault for ignoring the safe word and causing harm. The user's actions were a necessary response to protect himself and ensure his safety. The friend's criticism doesn't hold up because the domme's actions were in violation of the terms, making the user's non-payment a legitimate stand.\n"
