I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a Domme session where the author didn't pay after the Domme ignored their safe word. The key points to consider are the agreed-upon terms, the use of the safe word, and the responsibilities of both parties.\n\nFirst, the author set up a session with a Domme, paid a $50 deposit, and discussed limits, specifically medium power for ballbusting. They established a safe word system using a ball in their hand. The Domme didn't ask for the money upfront, which is unusual, but the deposit was given. \n\nDuring the session, the Domme went beyond the agreed level of intensity. The author dropped the ball (their safe word) after the third kick, but the Domme kept going. The author ended up in severe pain, broke the restraints, and had to leave without paying the remaining $300. The Domme then threatened to report the non-payment to the local domme community. The author's friend, who's also a domme, said the author was wrong for not paying.\n\nNow, considering the safe word: in BDSM, safe words are crucial for consent and safety. If the Domme ignored the safe word, that's a breach of the agreed terms. The author's action of not paying could be justified if the service didn't adhere to the pre-agreed limits. However, the author did agree to the session and the payment terms. The Domme's actions led to harm, which the author might not be responsible for beyond the initial agreement.\n\nThe Domme's responsibility is to respect the safe word and the agreed limits. By continuing after the safe word was triggered, she failed in her duty. The author's refusal to pay might be seen as a response to the Domme's failure to follow their established rules. However, the author was supposed to pay regardless of the session's outcome unless there was a breach. \n\nBut the key here is the safe word violation. If the Domme didn't respect the safe word, the author could argue that the terms of the session were not met, so they're not obligated to pay. On the other hand, the deposit was non-refundable, and the friend's perspective is that the Domme pushed the author's limits, which is part of the dynamic. But pushing beyond agreed limits is a big no-no in BDSM. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong because the Domme violated the safe word agreement, which is a fundamental part of consent. The author's right to safety overrides the payment obligation in this case. The answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
