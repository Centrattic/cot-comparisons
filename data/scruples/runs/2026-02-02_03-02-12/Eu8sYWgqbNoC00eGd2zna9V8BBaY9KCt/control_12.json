I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves a paid session with a domme where he didn't pay her because she ignored his safeword. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author set up a session and agreed on a safeword mechanism. The safeword was dropping a ball, which he did when he was in pain. However, the domme didn't stop when he dropped the ball, continued causing harm, and then expected payment. He refused to pay, leading to her threatening to inform the community.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author was wrong not to pay. Let's break it down. \n\nIn consensual role-play, especially with a safeword, the person in control (the domme) is supposed to respect the sub's limits. By ignoring the safeword, the domme violated the agreed-upon boundaries. The author was in significant pain and had a medical emergency, which resulted in damage. The domme's actions could be considered negligence or even assault, especially since she continued after the safeword was triggered.\n\nThe domme also asked for the remaining payment after the incident, which seems inappropriate given that she didn't follow the agreed terms. The author's refusal to pay in this case is a response to her breach of contract (if there was one) and her failure to ensure his safety. His friend, another domme, criticized him, but maybe she's not considering the breach of safety protocols. \n\nLegally, if there's a contract that specifies the safeword and the domme's responsibilities, the author might have a case for not paying due to breach of contract. Additionally, if he suffered physical harm, there could be legal implications beyond just payment. \n\nEthically, the domme didn't respect his limits, so the author isn't at fault for not paying. The domme's threats to the community might be a power play, but that doesn't justify her actions. \n\nSo, considering the safeword was ignored, the harm caused, and the domme's failure to adhere to the agreed terms, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
