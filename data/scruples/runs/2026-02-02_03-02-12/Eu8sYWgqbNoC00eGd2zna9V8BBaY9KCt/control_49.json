I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a paid session with a domme (Dominatrix) where the sub (the author) didn't pay after the domme ignored his safe word.\n\nFirst, the key points here are consent and safety protocols. The author and the domme set up a session with specific limits, including a safe word (dropping a ball) that would stop the session immediately. The domme went beyond the agreed-upon medium power, leading to the author dropping the ball, but she continued, causing severe pain. The author then refused to pay, leading to the domme's anger and threats.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics of BDSM play. In consensual power exchange, the domme is supposed to prioritize the sub's safety and consent. The safe word is a critical part of that. By ignoring the safe word, the domme breached the agreed terms, which could be considered a violation of trust and safety. The author's refusal to pay might be justified if the service wasn't delivered as agreed, especially since it led to injury and hospitalization.\n\nBut the domme's side is that she's a professional and expects payment regardless. However, if she violated the agreed-upon limits and safety protocols, the contract might be considered breached on her part. The author's friend, also a domme, is in her camp, but that might be a conflict of interest since they are part of the same community.\n\nLegally, if the domme didn't follow the agreed terms, the author might not be obligated to pay. Ethically, the domme's actions were negligent. The author had a right to stop the session and seek medical help. The domme's threats to report him for non-payment are problematic, as she was the one who didn't honor the agreed-upon safety measures.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The domme's actions were the issue here, not the author's refusal to pay after the violation of the safe word and the resulting harm.\n"
