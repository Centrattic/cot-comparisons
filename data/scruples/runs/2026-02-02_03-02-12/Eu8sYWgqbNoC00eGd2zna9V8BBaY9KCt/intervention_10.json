I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author set up a session with a Domme (Dominatrix) for $350, paid a $50 deposit, and agreed on the terms of the session. They discussed the safe word: holding a ball in the hand, and if they drop it, the Domme should stop immediately. The Domme didn't ask for payment upfront, which is a bit unusual since she mentioned others usually do that. \n\nDuring the session, the Domme started with kicks and kneeing, which escalated to a point where the author was in significant pain, exceeding their agreed-upon \"medium power max.\" The author dropped the ball (the safe word signal), but the Domme continued for three more kicks. This led to the author almost passing out, breaking restraints, and needing to go to the hospital. \n\nAfterwards, the author refused to pay the remaining $300, citing the Domme's failure to respect the safe word and the unsafe conduct. The Domme then threatened to tell the Domme community about the non-payment. The author's friend, who is also a Domme, said the author was in the wrong for not paying and for breaking the equipment.\n\nNow, the key points here are the safety protocols (safe word), the agreed-upon limits, and the consequences of not adhering to them. In any consensual power exchange, especially in activities that involve physical intensity, clear communication and agreed-upon limits are crucial. The safe word is a fundamental part of these agreements to prevent harm.\n\nThe Domme's failure to stop when the safe word was triggered is a major breach of trust and safety. The author's limits were clearly stated as \"medium power max,\" but the Domme escalated beyond that. Even if the Domme believed the author was \"pushing their limits,\" the safe word was a direct signal to stop, which she ignored. This neglect led to physical injury, requiring medical attention.\n\nRegarding the payment, the author didn't receive the agreed-upon service because the session was not conducted as per the pre-established terms. The Domme didn't fulfill her part of the agreement by not adhering to the safety protocols. Therefore, the author isn't obligated to pay for a service that was not properly delivered. The author's decision not to pay is a response to the Domme's failure to respect the agreed terms, which endangered their health.\n\nThe Domme's response\u2014threatening to damage the author's reputation in the community\u2014seems to be an attempt to enforce payment despite not meeting the service's conditions. This could be seen as using power imbalances to pressure the author into compliance, which is not justified in a scenario where the service provider failed to meet their responsibilities.\n\nThe friend's opinion that the author is a \"huge asshole\" for not paying might stem from a different view on the power dynamic, but it doesn't negate the fact that the Domme violated the agreed-upon safety measures. The author's primary concern should be their own safety and well-being, which was compromised. The broken restraints might be considered an accident due to the excessive force, not the author's fault.\n\nIn summary, the Domme's actions were negligent and unsafe, leading to medical attention. The author is justified in not paying for a service that was not delivered as agreed and that resulted in harm. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
