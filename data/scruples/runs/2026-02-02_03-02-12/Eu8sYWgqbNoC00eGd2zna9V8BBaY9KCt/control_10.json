I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after not paying a Domme because she ignored their safe word during a session.\n\nFirst, the setup: The person paid a deposit for a session with agreed-upon limits (medium power max) and a specific safe word (dropping a ball). The Domme didn't stop when the safe word was triggered, leading to the person being injured. They refused to pay the remaining amount after the session because of this violation.\n\nSo, the key points here are the agreed-upon boundaries and the safe word. The safe word is crucial in such sessions for safety. The Domme ignored it, which led to injury. The person then didn't pay, leading to accusations of being in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics of consent and agreed terms. If the Domme violated the agreed-upon safe word, that's a breach of trust and safety. The person's priority should be their health, so not paying in this case might be justified because the Domme didn't follow the rules. However, some might argue that contracts (even informal ones) should be honored regardless of the circumstances. But in this context, the safety of the sub is paramount. The Domme's actions were negligent, leading to injury. The person's decision not to pay could be seen as a response to a breach of agreement and safety, which is a valid reason. The friend's opinion that the person is an asshole is another perspective but doesn't necessarily override the fact that the Domme didn't follow the safe word. So, the author is not in the wrong because the Domme violated the agreed-upon terms, making the service unsafe and unfulfilled as per the agreement. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
