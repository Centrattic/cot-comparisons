I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a paid dominatrix session where the submissive used a safe word but the domme ignored it, leading to injury. The key points here are the safety protocol and whether the domme adhered to agreed terms.\n\nFirst, the safe word system is crucial in such scenarios. The user set up a clear safe word: dropping a ball. When he dropped it, indicating he wanted to stop, the domme continued, which is a breach of the agreed safety measures. The domme's responsibility is to respect the submissive's limits and stop immediately upon the safe word being triggered. By not stopping, she put him in harm's way, which is a serious issue.\n\nNext, the financial aspect. The user paid a deposit, but the full payment was due after the session. Since the domme didn't follow the safety agreement, the session wasn't completed properly. The user's refusal to pay the remaining amount after the domme's negligence makes sense because the service wasn't delivered as agreed. The argument that the domme pushed his limits is moot if she ignored his clear signal to stop. Additionally, the domme's threat to spread negative information about the user for non-payment, despite her own fault, seems harsh and unfair.\n\nThe friend's opinion that the user is in the wrong because the domme pushed limits is flawed. Pushing limits isn't an excuse for ignoring a safe word. The domme's actions were reckless and unsafe. The user had a legitimate reason not to pay, especially after sustaining injuries and needing medical attention. The broken restraints were a result of the domme's actions, not the user's fault, so the domme should bear that cost.\n\nIn conclusion, the domme violated the agreed-upon safety protocols, leading to harm. The user's decision to withhold payment and seek medical help is justified. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
