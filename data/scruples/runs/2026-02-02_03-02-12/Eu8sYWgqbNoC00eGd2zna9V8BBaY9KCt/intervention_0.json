I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not paying the Domme after the situation described. \n\nFirst, the context: The author paid a deposit, set up a session with clear limits and a safe word. The Domme didn't ask for the full payment upfront but took $50 as a deposit. During the session, the Domme significantly exceeded the agreed \"medium\" level, leading the author to drop the safe word (a ball) which the Domme ignored, causing injury. The author then had to stop the session themselves, broke a restraint, and left without paying the remaining $300. The Domme is threatening to spread negative information.\n\nNow, legal and ethical considerations. Contracts and services: The author agreed to pay $350 for the session. However, the service was not completed as per the agreement because the Domme failed to adhere to the established boundaries, leading to harm. The safe word system is a crucial part of such agreements, and the Domme's failure to respect it could be seen as a breach of terms. \n\nFrom a service perspective, if the service was not properly delivered or was dangerous, the client might not be obligated to pay the full amount. However, the initial payment was a deposit, which might be non-refundable depending on the terms. The author could be in a gray area here. If the session was supposed to be within \"medium\" limits and the Domme went beyond that, she may have not provided the agreed service, thus the author might not owe the full payment.\n\nEthically, the Domme's actions were negligent. Ignoring the safe word caused harm, so the author's decision not to pay could be justified as self-protection. Additionally, the threat of retaliation (telling the community) is a form of coercion, which is unethical.\n\nThe friend's perspective is that the author should pay because the Domme pushed limits. However, pushing beyond agreed limits is dangerous and violates the terms. The broken restraint could be due to the Domme's excessive force, not the author's fault.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong because the Domme breached the agreed terms and caused harm. The author's priority should be health and safety, and they aren't obligated to pay for a service that was not properly executed and resulted in injury.\n"
