I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not paying the Domme after she ignored his safe word. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author set up a session with a Domme, paid a $50 deposit, agreed on a medium power level for ballbusting. They had a safe word system: holding a ball, and if he dropped it, she'd stop. During the session, she started with kicks that got progressively harder, even though he said medium was the max. At 20 minutes, she kicked him so hard he dropped the ball (triggering the safe word), but she didn't stop. Instead, she kept kicking three more times, causing severe pain. He ended up breaking a restraint to protect himself, and she then yelled at him for damaging her equipment. She demanded the remaining $300, and he refused, saying she violated the safe word. She threatened to tell the Domme community he wouldn't pay, and he went to the hospital, where they found swelling but no damage.\n\nNow, the friend, who is a Domme, is telling him he's an asshole for not paying. The user is wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: agreed terms (medium power, safe word), the Domme exceeded the agreed intensity, ignored the safe word, caused harm, then sought payment. The author refused to pay because she breached the agreed-upon safety and caused injury. The Domme claims she was just pushing limits and that he should pay.\n\nIn this scenario, the Domme clearly didn't follow the agreed-upon rules. The safe word was supposed to stop the session immediately, but she ignored it. That's a major violation. She also went beyond the agreed intensity, leading to harm. The author was harmed and refused to pay because she didn't honor the terms. The Domme is now threatening to spread that he didn't pay, but the author's refusal is because of her breach of contract (if you will). \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. The Domme was the one who violated the agreed terms, and he's not obligated to pay for a service that was delivered in a dangerous, non-consensual manner. The fact that he went to the hospital shows the harm, and the Domme's reaction was to blame him, which is inappropriate. So the answer should be B.\n"
