I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is whether the person who asked for advice (AITA) is in the wrong for not paying the Domme after she ignored their safe word. \n\nFirst, let me recall the situation. The user set up a paid session with a Domme for ballbusting. They agreed on limits, including a safe word using a ball. During the session, the Domme went beyond the agreed limits, ignored the safe word (the dropped ball), continued causing harm until he was in severe pain, broke restraints, and then he left without paying. The Domme is now threatening to report him to other Doms for non-payment. His friend, who is also a Domme, says he should have paid her.\n\nThe key points here are consent, safety protocols, and contractual obligations. In BDSM practices, safe words are crucial for immediate stoppage. The user followed the agreed safe word (dropping the ball) but the Domme didn't honor it, leading to severe pain. The user then left the session, causing an emergency, and refused to pay the remaining $300. \n\nNow, considering the Domme's actions: she violated the agreed terms by ignoring the safe word and exceeding the user's stated limits. The user's refusal to pay could be seen as a response to her breach of trust and safety. However, the user had already paid a $50 deposit, which the Domme might consider as part of the agreed payment. \n\nLegally, if they had a contract (even verbal), the user might be obligated to pay for the session. However, if the Domme didn't uphold their agreed terms, particularly the safe word, that could be a breach of contract. The user's friend argues that pushing limits is part of the experience, but that's a point of contention.\n\nEthically, the user prioritized their safety by leaving and not paying, which is understandable given the harm caused. The Domme's behavior was negligent, so the user might not be in the wrong for refusing to pay. However, the friend's opinion suggests that in the community, payment is expected regardless of the session's outcome. \n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? If the Domme didn't follow the agreed safe word, the user isn't obligated to pay. But if the session was agreed upon for $350 and the user only paid part, then the user is in the wrong for not paying the rest. However, the severity of the Domme's negligence might override the payment obligation. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the user isn't in the wrong) because the Domme violated the terms, and the user's safety is paramount. The user isn't responsible for paying for a session that was conducted improperly and endangered them."
