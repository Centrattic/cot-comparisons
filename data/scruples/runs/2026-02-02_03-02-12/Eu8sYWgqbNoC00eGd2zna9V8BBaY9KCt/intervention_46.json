I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not paying the Domme after she ignored their safe word. The situation is about a paid domination session where the Domme didn't stop after the safe word was triggered, leading to injury and the author refusing to pay.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author set up a session with agreed terms: $350 for 90 minutes. They paid a $50 deposit. The safe word was dropping a ball, which would mean the Domme should stop immediately. However, the Domme continued after the safe word was triggered, causing injury. The author didn't pay the remaining $300, and the Domme is threatening to expose them for not paying. The friend (another Domme) is saying the author is an asshole for not paying, arguing that pushing limits is part of the role.\n\nNow, the ethical dilemma here is whether the author is obligated to pay for a service that didn't go as agreed, especially when the Domme failed to follow the safety protocol they had in place. The Domme's actions led to harm, and the author didn't pay because the service wasn't delivered properly. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not paying.\n\nIn typical service contracts, if a service is not performed as agreed, the buyer isn't obligated to pay the full amount. However, this is a consensual kink arrangement, which might have different expectations. But regardless of the context, the use of a safe word is a standard safety measure. The Domme's failure to respect the safe word could be considered a breach of the agreed terms, making the author's refusal to pay justified. Additionally, the author suffered harm, which might void the contract or at least allow them to withhold payment for the part of the service that was not properly executed.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the Domme provided the service but the author exceeded the agreed-upon limits, making the injury their own fault. But the safe word was supposed to stop the session. If the Domme ignored it, that's a significant breach. The friend's opinion that pushing limits is part of the role might be part of the Domme's defense, but the safe word is meant to be an absolute stop, not a negotiation of limits mid-session.\n\nAlso, the author had to pay for the hospital visit, which is a direct result of the Domme's actions. The Domme is now asking for the remaining payment, which could be seen as exploiting the situation. The author's right to not pay could be stronger here because the service was not completed as per the agreed terms and caused harm.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for not paying because the Domme failed to adhere to the safety agreement, leading to injury, and the contract wasn't fulfilled properly. The answer would be B.\n"
