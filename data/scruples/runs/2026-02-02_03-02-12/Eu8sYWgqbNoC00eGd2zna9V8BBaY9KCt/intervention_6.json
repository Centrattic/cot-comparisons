I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a domme (dominant in a BDSM context) who didn't stop after the sub (the writer) used their safe word, leading to injury. The writer didn't pay the domme afterward, and now the domme is threatening repercussions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the agreement they had. The writer paid a $50 deposit and agreed to a $350 payment for a 90-minute session. The domme didn't ask for upfront payment, which is a bit unusual but not unheard of. The key issue here is the safe word. The writer used their safe word (dropping the ball) when they were in significant pain, but the domme continued the punishment. That's a serious breach of safety protocols in BDSM. Safe words are supposed to be respected immediately, so the domme's failure to stop when the safe word was given is a major problem. \n\nThe writer then left the session without paying the remaining $300, claiming they were injured. Their friend, another domme, said they should have paid regardless. But in BDSM, the sub's well-being and safety should be the top priority. If a domme doesn't respect the safe word, that's a violation of the agreed-upon boundaries. The writer was in distress and needed medical attention, so their decision to prioritize their health over the payment is understandable. \n\nThe domme is now threatening to expose the writer in the community, which is a form of harassment. The writer's actions in not paying could be seen as justified given the domme's negligence. The broken restraints might be a result of the writer's reaction to the pain, which is a consequence of the domme's failure to stop. \n\nLegally, if there was a contract or explicit agreement, not paying could be an issue, but in this case, the domme didn't enforce payment upfront and the session was terminated due to her negligence. Ethically, the domme violated the safety agreement, so the writer isn't in the wrong for not paying. The friend's opinion might be biased since she's a domme and might prioritize payment over safety, but the community standards in BDSM emphasize consent and safety. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the writer isn't in the wrong because the domme failed to follow the agreed-upon safe word protocol, leading to injury. The decision to not pay and seek medical help was the right choice given the circumstances.\n"
