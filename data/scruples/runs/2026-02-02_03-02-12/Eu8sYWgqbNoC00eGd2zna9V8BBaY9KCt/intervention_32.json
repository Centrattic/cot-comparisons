I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully. \n\nThe author, a young man into ballbusting, arranged a session with a Domme (dominatrix) for $350. They met up, and the Domme didn't ask for the money upfront but took a $50 deposit. The author explained his limits to her, saying he's into light to medium max power. The Domme agreed to restrain and ball gag him, and they set a safe word where he holds a ball; if he drops it, she stops and checks on him. \n\nAfter 10 minutes, the Domme starts kicking hard. At 20 minutes, she's kneeing really hard, and then boots him full force even after he told her to stick to medium power. He drops the ball, but she continues for three more kicks. He's in so much pain he almost passes out, can't breathe, breaks a restraint while thrashing, and she yells at him for breaking the equipment. Then she says he owes the remaining $300. He refuses to pay and goes to the hospital, where his testicles doubled in size but no damage. The next day, his friend Domme says he's an asshole for not paying, claiming the Domme pushed his limits and he broke her straps, costing her money.\n\nSo the main question is: Should the author pay the Domme after she ignored his safe word? Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the safe word system is crucial in BDSM for safety. The author clearly communicated his safe word and the agreed-upon action (drop the ball to signal stopping). When he dropped the ball, the Domme didn't stop, which is a violation of the agreed safety protocol. This is a serious issue because not honoring the safe word can lead to physical and psychological harm. The author's primary concern here is his safety and the injury sustained. \n\nThe Domme then continued the activity despite the safe word, causing severe pain. He ended up having to break free to stop her, which damaged her equipment. The Domme is now expecting payment, but he argues he shouldn't have to pay because she didn't follow the safe word agreement and was dangerous. \n\nThe friend Domme's perspective is that the Domme pushed his limits, which is part of the role, and that the author is responsible for the damage because he broke the straps. But pushing limits usually requires consent and communication. The author had already set a limit (medium power max) and the safe word, which the Domme ignored. \n\nIn terms of contract and payment, typically, in such services, the agreed terms are binding. However, when safety protocols are violated, especially leading to injury, the responsibility shifts. The Domme's failure to stop upon the safe word being triggered is a breach of trust and safety, which could be considered a fundamental part of the agreement. If she didn't honor the safe word, the session wasn't conducted properly, so the author might not be obligated to pay the remaining amount. \n\nOn the other hand, the Domme might argue that she's providing a service and the author is at fault for breaking the equipment. But the equipment was broken as a result of her not stopping, leading to his thrashing. It's her negligence in following the safe word that caused the damage, so she might be responsible for the broken restraints. \n\nThe author's actions\u2014refusing to pay and seeking medical attention\u2014seem to be in response to a safety violation. Legally, if the service wasn't delivered as agreed (due to the Domme not adhering to the safe word), he might have a case for not paying. Ethically, the Domme's actions were reckless, and the author is protecting himself by not paying. \n\nThe friend Domme's comment that he's an asshole might be from the perspective of the Domme community valuing payment regardless, but that doesn't justify violating the safe word. Safety should always come first. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because the Domme failed to follow the agreed-upon safe word, leading to injury. The damage to the restraints was a direct result of her not stopping, so she's responsible for that. The author prioritized his health, which is the right choice. Therefore, he doesn't have to pay.\n"
