I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author set up a session with a domme for $350, paid a $50 deposit, and had a safe word arrangement. The safe word was dropping a ball, which would make her stop immediately. The domme went beyond the agreed \"medium power max\" and kept going even after the safe word was triggered. The author ended up needing to go to the hospital and refused to pay the remaining $300. The domme is now threatening to inform the community, and the author's friend (also a domme) is telling them they're an asshole for not paying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue is whether the author is obligated to pay despite the domme's misconduct. In consensual activities, especially in kink or fetish play, communication and respecting boundaries are crucial. The safe word is a fundamental part of negotiations in such scenarios. The domme here ignored the safe word, which is a major violation.\n\nLegally, if the service was not delivered as per the agreed terms (especially with disregard for the client's safety and consent), the client might not be obligated to pay the full amount. However, there could be arguments about the initial agreement and payment terms. But the author did pay a deposit, which might be a point of contention. However, the main issue is the safety and the violation of the agreed-upon safe word. \n\nEthically, the domme failed in her duty to respect the client's limits, which is a core part of any consensual power exchange. The client's health and safety are paramount. The friend's opinion that the author is in the wrong seems to be based on the idea that the domme challenged the limits, but pushing beyond agreed-upon limits is not acceptable in any ethical kink scenario. \n\nThe breaking of the restraints might be a factor, but if the domme exceeded the agreed intensity without consent, leading to the client breaking free, it's the domme's fault for not respecting the boundaries. The author's priority was to stop the activity due to pain and potential injury, which is reasonable. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because the domme violated the agreed terms, ignored the safe word, and endangered the client's well-being. The author's decision to seek medical attention and not pay the remaining fee is justified. The friend's judgment seems to be misinformed, as the domme's actions were unethical and unsafe.\n"
