I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a Domme (dominant) and a sub (submissive) in a BDSM session. The user paid a deposit, set up a session with a safe word, but the Domme ignored the safe word, leading to injury. The user then didn't pay the remaining balance and the Domme is upset.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points. The user agreed on a safe word system: holding a ball, dropping it means stop. However, during the session, the Domme went beyond the agreed limits, ignored the dropped ball (safe word), caused injury, and then expected payment. The user didn't pay and went to the hospital. The user's friend, who is also a Domme, says they're in the wrong for not paying.\n\nNow, thinking about BDSM ethics. Consent and communication are crucial. Safe words are supposed to be respected to ensure the sub's safety. If the Domme ignored the safe word, she violated the agreed-upon boundaries. The user was harmed, which is a serious issue. Even if the Domme argues that she was pushing limits, which is common in some play, the safe word is supposed to override anything. Ignoring it is a breach of trust and safety.\n\nThe user's refusal to pay could be justified because the service was not provided as agreed. The Domme didn't follow the agreed terms, leading to harm. Also, the user suffered injuries and sought medical attention, which the Domme contributed to. In such cases, the person who caused harm is not entitled to payment, especially if they breached the agreement.\n\nThe friend's argument that the user is a \"huge asshole\" for not paying might be from the perspective of Domme community standards, but if the Domme didn't uphold her end of the agreement, the user isn't obligated to pay. Additionally, the user's safety was compromised, which is a major red flag. The Domme should have prioritized the user's well-being over payment.\n\nAnother angle: in some jurisdictions, services involving physical harm might have legal implications, but this is more about ethical responsibility. The user didn't get the service they paid for, and the Domme's actions were negligent. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong for not paying after such a violation.\n"
