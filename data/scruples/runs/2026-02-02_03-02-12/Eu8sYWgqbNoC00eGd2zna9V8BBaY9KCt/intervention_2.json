I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong for not paying a Domme after she ignored their safe word. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person arranged a session with a Domme, paid a deposit, and they agreed on a safe word using a ball. The Domme went beyond the agreed intensity, ignored the safe word, and caused significant pain, leading to an injury. The person didn't pay the remaining fee and the Domme is threatening to report them.\n\nThe key points here are the agreed-upon limits and the safe word system. In any consensual power dynamics, especially in BDSM, communication and respecting boundaries are crucial. The safe word is supposed to be a way to stop the action immediately if the sub is in too much pain or distress. The Domme ignored the safe word, continued beyond the agreed intensity, and caused harm. That's a breach of trust and the agreed terms.\n\nThe Domme's actions led to the person needing medical attention, which is serious. The friend, who's also a Domme, is telling the person they should have paid despite the Domme's failure to follow the safe word. However, that advice seems to prioritize the Domme's financial loss over the well-being of the sub. \n\nIn consensual activities, the sub's safety and comfort are paramount. If the Domme didn't adhere to the agreed terms and caused harm, the sub isn't obligated to pay for services not rendered properly. The person had a right to prioritize their health and safety over the payment. \n\nAdditionally, the Domme is now threatening the person's reputation in the community for not paying, which is a form of coercion. The person's decision not to pay is justified given the Domme's negligence. The friend's judgment might be influenced by the community's norms, but the primary responsibility lies with the Domme to follow the agreed-upon limits and safe words.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
