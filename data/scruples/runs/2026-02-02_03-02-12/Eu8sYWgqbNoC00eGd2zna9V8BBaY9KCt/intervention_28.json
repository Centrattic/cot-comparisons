I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a Domme (a dominant in a BDSM context) who didn't stop when the sub (the submissive) used their safe word. The sub ended up in a lot of pain, went to the hospital, and refused to pay the Domme, who then threatened to ruin their reputation for not paying.\n\nSo, the main points here are consent and safety protocols. The sub had set a safe word (dropping a ball) which the Domme ignored, leading to injury. In BDSM, safe words are critical for the safety and consent of the participants. The Domme's responsibility is to ensure the sub's safety and follow agreed-upon limits. By continuing after the safe word was triggered, the Domme breached the basic trust and safety required for such activities. \n\nNow, the Domme is asking for payment despite causing harm and breaking equipment. The sub refuses to pay because the Domme didn't follow the agreed safety measures. The friend also says the sub is in the wrong, but that's conflicting with the actual scenario. The sub's actions were in self-preservation, going to the hospital, which is necessary after potential injury. \n\nFinancial responsibility: If the Domme caused harm by not respecting the safe word, the sub isn't obligated to pay for services that were not rendered properly. The Domme is at fault for not adhering to the agreed-upon terms. The broken restraints were a result of the sub trying to protect themselves, not negligence on their part. \n\nEthically and legally, the sub isn't in the wrong here. The Domme failed her duty to follow the safe word protocol, leading to harm. The sub's refusal to pay is justified as the service was not provided safely. The threats from the Domme about reputational damage are inappropriate and bullying. \n\nSo, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
