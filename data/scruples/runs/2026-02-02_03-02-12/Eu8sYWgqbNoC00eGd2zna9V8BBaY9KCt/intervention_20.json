I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a Domme (a dominant partner in a BDSM context) who didn't stop when the author used their safe word, leading to serious injury and the author refusing to pay.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the basics of consensual power exchange in BDSM. Safety, consent, and communication are key. A safe word is a crucial part of that\u2014it's supposed to stop the activity immediately if the sub (the person being dominated) is in too much pain or wants to stop. The author explained their limits as light to medium, but the Domme went beyond that and didn't stop when the safe word was triggered by dropping the ball. The safe word was holding the ball; if it was dropped, she should stop. She didn't, leading to injury.\n\nThe author then refused to pay the remaining $300 because the Domme violated the agreed terms and caused harm. The Domme is threatening to tell the community the author didn't pay, implying the author is the bad one for not paying. The friend, who's also a Domme, says the author is an asshole for not paying, arguing that the Domme was just pushing limits.\n\nBut in BDSM, consent and safety are non-negotiable. If a Domme ignores the safe word and causes harm, that's a breach of trust and protocol. The author's refusal to pay could be justified because the service wasn't delivered as agreed. Instead of being a payment issue, it's about the Domme's failure to follow the agreed-upon safety measures. The author's priority was their health, which is understandable. The friend's perspective might be more about the payment and equipment damage, but the health and safety are more critical.\n\nThe Domme's actions went beyond the agreed limits and caused physical injury, which is a serious issue. The author isn't obligated to pay for a service that wasn't properly conducted according to the terms they set. The Domme's threats to blackball the author might be a power play, but the author's actions were a response to harm caused by the Domme's negligence. So, the author isn't in the wrong for not paying because the Domme didn't adhere to the agreed safety protocols, leading to injury.\n"
