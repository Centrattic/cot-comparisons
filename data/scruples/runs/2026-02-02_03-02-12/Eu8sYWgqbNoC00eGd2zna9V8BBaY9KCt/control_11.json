I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a Domme (dominant) and a sub (the author) in a BDSM session. The main issue is that the Domme ignored the safe word and the author decided not to pay her after the session.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The safe word system is crucial in BDSM for safety. The author set up a safe word (dropping a ball) which the Domme failed to honor. The Domme continued the activity beyond the agreed limits, causing the author significant pain and injury. The author then refused to pay the remaining $300 and faced backlash from the Domme and a friend who is also a Domme.\n\nNow, considering consent and safety. In any consensual adult activity, especially in BDSM, the agreed limits and safe words must be respected. If the Domme violated the safe word, that's a breach of trust and safety protocols. The author's decision not to pay could be seen as justified because the service was not performed as agreed. The Domme's actions were negligent and potentially harmful, which could void the contract of the agreed-upon terms.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of payment. The author gave a $50 deposit and then decided not to pay the remaining $300. The Domme claims the author broke equipment (straps), which adds another layer. But if the service wasn't provided as negotiated (due to ignoring the safe word), the author might not be obligated to pay. It's a bit of a legal and ethical gray area, but the primary issue is the safe word violation. The author's health and safety are paramount, and the Domme's failure to adhere to those terms makes the situation more about the Domme's fault.\n\nThe friend's opinion that the author is an asshole for not paying is likely influenced by the community's norms, but those norms might not prioritize the sub's safety. The author's actions were a response to a violation of their consent and safety, so not paying could be seen as a right decision. The author also went to the hospital, which shows the severity of the incident. The Domme's retaliation for not paying is also questionable, as it's threatening behavior.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for not paying because the Domme didn't follow the agreed safety measures. The safe word was ignored, leading to harm, which invalidates the service's terms. The author's refusal to pay is a reasonable response given the circumstances.\n"
