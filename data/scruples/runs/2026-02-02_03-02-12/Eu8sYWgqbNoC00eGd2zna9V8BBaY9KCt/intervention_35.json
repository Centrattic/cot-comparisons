I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not paying the Domme after she ignored their safe word.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person paid a deposit, set up a session with clear limits, and established a safe word (holding a ball). The Domme, however, went beyond the agreed limits, ignored the safe word, and caused significant harm. The person then didn't pay the remaining fee because of the Domme's failure to follow safety protocols and the resulting injury.\n\nThe main points here are consent and safety. The Domme broke the established boundaries, which is a big deal in any consensual activity, especially in activities that involve physical pain. The safe word system is crucial to ensure that the sub can stop the session if it becomes too much. By ignoring the safe word and continuing, the Domme acted recklessly, which led to injury. \n\nThe Domme then expected payment even though she didn't adhere to the agreed terms and caused damage. The person not paying could be seen as a refusal to pay for a service that was not performed as agreed and may have even been harmful. \n\nThe friend, who is also a Domme, argues that pushing limits is part of the role, but that's not an excuse for ignoring a safe word. The key here is that the Domme didn't follow the safety agreements, which is a breach of trust and responsibility. \n\nIn terms of legal or ethical responsibility, the person isn't obligated to pay for a service that was not provided as negotiated and that caused harm. The Domme's actions could even be considered negligence or assault, depending on the circumstances. \n\nSo, the person not paying is justifiable because the Domme failed to uphold the agreed terms and caused harm. The person's health and safety are more important than the payment, and they have a right to refuse paying for a service that was not properly provided and was potentially dangerous.\n"
