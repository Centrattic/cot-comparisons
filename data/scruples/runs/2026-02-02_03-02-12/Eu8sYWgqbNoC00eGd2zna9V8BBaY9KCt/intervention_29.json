I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a paid session with a dominatrix (Domme) where the author didn't pay after the Domme ignored their safe word.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the key points. The author set up a session, paid a deposit, and agreed on limits. The Domme didn't ask for money upfront, which is unusual. They used a safe word system involving a ball. During the session, the Domme went beyond the agreed medium power, leading to the author dropping the ball (their safe word) but she continued. The author ended up in pain, broke restraints, and went to the hospital. They refused to pay the remaining amount, leading to the Domme threatening to report them.\n\nThe Domme's side, as per the friend's opinion, is that the Domme pushed limits appropriately. But the author felt violated. The main issue is whether the Domme breached the agreed terms by ignoring the safe word, leading to harm. \n\nIn such scenarios, the safe word is a critical agreement for consent and safety. If the Domme ignored it, that's a serious violation. The author not paying could be justified if the service didn't meet the agreed terms and caused harm. However, the Domme might argue that the service was provided, hence payment is due. But since the service was harmful and breached the agreed boundaries, the author isn't necessarily at fault for not paying. \n\nAlso, the author suffered medical consequences, which adds weight to their side. The friend's opinion that the author is in the wrong might be based on the idea that once the session starts, payment is expected regardless, but that's not considering the violation of the safe word, which is a fundamental part of the agreement.\n\nSo, the answer would lean towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because the Domme failed to adhere to the agreed safe words and caused harm, which invalidates the service provided. The author's refusal to pay is a response to a breach of contract and safety, not just a personal change of mind.\n"
