I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not paying a Domme after she ignored their safe word during a ballbusting session.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author set up a session with a Domme, specifying their limits as light to medium. They agreed on a safe word system where dropping a ball would signal to stop. However, the Domme went beyond the agreed intensity, causing severe pain. The author dropped the ball, but she didn't stop. He ended up in the hospital, and now she's demanding payment and threatening to report him. His friend, another Domme, says he's an asshole for not paying because the Domme pushed his limits as part of the role.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is obligated to pay despite the Domme violating safety agreements. The safe word system is crucial in BDSM for consent and safety. If the Domme ignored the safe word, that's a serious breach of trust and safety. The author's physical harm and the need to go to the hospital indicates that the session was dangerous and the Domme didn't follow the established rules. \n\nThe friend's argument that pushing limits is part of the Domme's role might be common in some circles, but consent should always be respected. Even if the Domme intended to challenge the author's limits, the agreed safe word must be honored to stop the session immediately. The author's refusal to pay is a response to the Domme's negligence in ensuring his safety. \n\nLegally, if there's a service agreement and the Domme didn't provide the agreed-upon service (i.e., within the specified limits), the author might not be obligated to pay. Ethically, the Domme's actions were harmful and disregarded the safety protocol, which is a fundamental aspect of consensual BDSM play. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong because the Domme failed to adhere to the agreed terms, leading to medical attention and potential harm. The key is that the safe word was ignored, making the situation unsafe. The author's decision to not pay due to this breach seems justified.\n"
