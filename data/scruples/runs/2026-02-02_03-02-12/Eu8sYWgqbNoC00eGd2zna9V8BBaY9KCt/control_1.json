I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a Domme (dominant in a BDSM context) and a sub (the author) who set up a session with a safe word. The safe word was a ball in the hand; dropping it would signal to stop. The Domme supposedly ignored the safe word and continued after the author dropped the ball, causing injury. The author didn't pay the remaining $300, and the Domme is threatening to spread negative info about them. The friend, who's also a domme, thinks the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the key elements here are consent, safety, and the violation of agreed-upon boundaries. In BDSM, it's crucial that all parties consent to the activities and that safe words are respected. The safe word is a non-negotiable part of these interactions to ensure safety. The author's safe word was clearly communicated: holding a ball, dropping it means stop. When the Domme continued after the safe word was triggered, that's a serious breach of trust and safety protocols.\n\nThe Domme's actions went beyond the agreed intensity level (\"medium power max\") and caused the author physical harm. The fact that the Domme didn't stop after the safe word was triggered is a major issue. The author's decision not to pay the remaining amount would typically be a business matter, but considering the violation of safety and the resulting injury, it's more about protecting themselves from someone who didn't follow agreed-upon rules.\n\nThe friend's opinion that the author is a \"huge asshole\" for not paying might stem from a different perspective on the value of the session, but if the session was conducted unsafely and caused harm, the author isn't obligated to pay. The Domme's threat to spread negative info about the author is also problematic and could be considered harassment or defamation.\n\nIn terms of legal aspects, the use of a safe word is part of the contract between the parties. The Domme's failure to adhere to this could be considered negligence or even assault, depending on jurisdiction. The author's decision to seek medical attention was prudent, and the physical evidence of injury supports their claim of harm.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't in the wrong for not paying because the Domme violated the agreed-upon safe word and caused harm. The author's actions were a response to a breach of safety protocols and potential negligence. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
