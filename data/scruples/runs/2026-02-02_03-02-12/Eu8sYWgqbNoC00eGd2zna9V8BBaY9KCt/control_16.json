I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author arranged a session with a Domme, paid a $50 deposit out of $350 total. They discussed limits, with the safe word being dropping a ball. The Domme restrained and gagged the author, then proceeded to kick and knee them harder than agreed. When the author dropped the ball (the safe word signal), the Domme didn't stop and kept hitting them. The author ended up in the hospital but was fine. They refused to pay the remaining $300, leading the Domme to threaten the community. The author's friend, a Domme, says they're an asshole for not paying.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the agreed safe word was ignored, the Domme went beyond the agreed limits, caused harm, and then the author didn't pay. The author is being called a jerk for not paying, but maybe they have a valid point because the Domme broke the agreed terms and caused injury.\n\nIn BDSM, safe words are crucial for consent and safety. Ignoring the safe word is a serious breach of trust and safety protocols. The Domme's actions led to the author being injured, which is a legal and ethical issue. The author's refusal to pay could be justified as the service was not provided as agreed, and the Domme didn't adhere to the safety limits. Additionally, the author was harmed, so they have a right to seek medical attention and not pay for a session that was dangerous and non-consensual beyond their initial agreement.\n\nThe friend's perspective that the Domme pushed limits normally might be a misunderstanding. If the Domme exceeded the agreed limits despite the safe word, that's not acceptable. The author's actions in not paying are a response to the Domme's failure to follow the established rules, which makes them not at fault. The Domme's threat to involve the community is also a manipulation tactic, which is unethical.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. They followed the safe word protocol, were harmed due to the Domme's negligence, and refused to pay for a service that was not properly conducted. The answer should be B.\n"
