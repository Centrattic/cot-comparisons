I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a Domme (dominant in a BDSM context) who ignored the sub's safe word during a session, leading to injury and the author not paying the fee.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author set clear limits: medium power max for ballbusting. The Domme agreed and set up a safe word (dropping a ball). During the session, the Domme went beyond the agreed limits, ignored the safe word, caused the author to drop the ball (triggering the safe word), continued for three more kicks, leading to injury. The Domme then demanded payment and threatened the author. The author refused to pay and went to the hospital. A friend (also a domme) is judging the author, saying they should have paid despite the incident.\n\nNow, in BDSM communities, there's a concept of \"safe, sane, and consensual\" play. Safe words are crucial for communication and safety. If a Domme ignores the safe word and causes harm, that violates the trust and safety protocols. The author's main argument is that the Domme failed to adhere to agreed-upon terms, resulting in injury. Therefore, the author isn't obligated to pay for a service that was not provided safely or as negotiated.\n\nThe friend's perspective is that the Domme pushed the author's limits, which is part of the role, but that's a bit disingenuous if the limits were clearly stated and exceeded. The author's refusal to pay is justified because the service was not delivered properly, and the Domme's actions were negligent. Additionally, the author suffered physical harm, which is a serious issue.\n\nIn legal terms, if someone provides a service negligently causing injury, the injured party isn't required to pay for the service. Moreover, the Domme's actions could be considered a breach of contract or negligence. The author's right to withhold payment is supported by the failure to meet the agreed terms and the resulting harm.\n\nThe key factors here are the breach of agreed-upon boundaries, failure to respect the safe word, and resulting injury. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their health and safety over payment for a faulty service. The Domme's threats and the friend's judgment don't negate the author's valid claim.\n"
