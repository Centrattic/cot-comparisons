I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not paying the Domme after she ignored his safe word during a session. \n\nFirst, the setup: The author agreed on a session with specific limits (medium power max for ballbusting). They had a safe word system where dropping a ball would signal her to stop. However, during the session, the Domme went beyond the agreed intensity, ignored the safe word, and caused significant injury. The author didn't pay the remaining $300 and faced backlash from the Domme and a friend who is also a Domme.\n\nKey points to consider:\n1. **Consent and Boundaries**: The session should be based on mutual consent and agreed-upon limits. The Domme violated the safe word protocol, which is a fundamental aspect of consensual power exchange. This is a serious breach of trust and safety.\n2. **Injury and Health**: The author ended up in the hospital. Physical harm resulting from not respecting boundaries is a major issue. The Domme's actions led to a medical emergency, which is a red flag for safety.\n3. **Financial Responsibility**: The Domme asked for payment despite her negligence. Normally, if someone fails to provide the agreed service (in this case, respecting the safe word and providing a safe session), they shouldn't expect full payment. The author's refusal to pay can be seen as justified because the service wasn't delivered as promised.\n4. **Equipment Damage**: The author broke a restraint, which the Domme is upset about. However, if the Domme's actions caused the injury, the responsibility for equipment damage might be hers, especially if she didn't maintain control or check the restraints' safety beforehand.\n5. **Community Reactions**: The friend's criticism that the author is an \"asshole\" for not paying seems to ignore the Domme's responsibility. In ethical B/D practices, the Domme is supposed to prioritize the sub's well-being. The friend's stance might be influenced by the power dynamics and community norms rather than actual ethics.\n\nPotential counterarguments: The Domme might argue that she was following through on the agreed session, but the author's limits were exceeded. However, safe words are non-negotiable in such scenarios. The fact that the safe word was ignored is a clear violation of the agreed terms. The payment issue is secondary to the safety breach. The author's priority was health, which is the correct approach.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because the Domme failed to uphold the agreed safety protocols, caused harm, and the author's refusal to pay is a direct result of the service not being provided as contracted, especially with the added risk to his health. The Domme's threat to report him for non-payment is inappropriate given the circumstances.\n"
