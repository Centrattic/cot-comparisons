I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong (AITA) for not paying a Domme after she ignored their safe word. The situation involves a Domme who, despite being told the sub's limits for ballbusting, continued beyond those limits, causing significant pain. The sub used the safe word (dropping the ball) but the Domme didn't stop, leading to injury and the sub going to the hospital. They didn't pay the remaining $300 and the Domme is threatening to report them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of a D/s (Dominant/submissive) relationship. Safety protocols are crucial here, especially the use of safe words. Typically, a safe word is an agreement that when said or signaled, the activity stops immediately. In this case, the safe word was dropping the ball, which the sub did. The Domme didn't stop, which is a major violation of consent and the agreed-upon boundaries. \n\nThe user mentioned that they agreed to medium power max, but the Domme escalated to full force. That's a breach of the initial agreement. Even if the Domme is experienced, she should have checked in with the sub as the session progressed to ensure they're within their limits. The sub's health and safety should be the top priority. The fact that the Domme didn't stop after the safe word was triggered is the key issue here. \n\nThe friend, who is also a domme, says the sub is an asshole for not paying. But from a consent and safety perspective, the Domme is the one who violated the agreement. The sub's non-payment could be seen as a refusal to support someone who didn't respect their boundaries. However, the friend's argument might be from a community standpoint where contracts are honored regardless of the circumstances, but that's conflicting with the safety aspect. \n\nLegally and ethically, consent to a certain level of activity doesn't mean consent to go beyond it. If the Domme ignored the safe word, she's the one at fault. The sub's decision to seek medical attention is justified. The non-payment could be a result of them not receiving the agreed service properly, as the Domme didn't adhere to the safeword protocol. \n\nBut there's a nuance here. In some kink communities, there's an expectation that even if the session goes bad, you pay because it's a professional service. However, if the Domme didn't follow the agreed safe words, which are critical in such activities, then the service wasn't performed as per the sub's consent. So the sub has a valid reason to not pay, especially since they were harmed and had to go to the hospital. \n\nThe Domme's actions led to a dangerous situation, so the sub's refusal to pay might be justified as a form of holding the Domme accountable. The threats from the Domme about reporting the sub are also problematic because it sounds like retaliation for not paying when she was the one at fault. \n\nIn summary, the Domme violated the safe word, causing harm. The sub had the right to refuse payment and seek medical help. The friend's opinion doesn't align with the safety breach, so the community might side with the sub. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
