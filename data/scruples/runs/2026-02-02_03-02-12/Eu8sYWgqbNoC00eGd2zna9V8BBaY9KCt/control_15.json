I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not paying the domme after she ignored their safe word. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author set up a paid session with a domme. They agreed on limits, including a safe word (dropping a ball) which she was supposed to stop immediately if triggered. During the session, the domme went beyond the agreed limits, causing the author severe pain. The author dropped the ball (safe word), but the domme continued, leading to injury. The author then refused to pay the remaining fee and was threatened by the domme.\n\nSo, the main points here are the violation of agreed-upon limits and the safe word being ignored. In any consensual power exchange, especially in kink or fetish play, communication and adherence to safety protocols are paramount. The safe word is there to stop the activity if the sub becomes uncomfortable or in pain beyond their limits. The domme's responsibility is to respect that.\n\nThe domme didn't stop when the safe word was triggered, which is a serious breach of the agreement. By continuing, she put the author's health at risk. The author's priority should be their safety and well-being. Refusing to pay in this case is understandable because the service was not provided as agreed and caused harm. \n\nThe friend (who's also a domme) saying the author is wrong might be from a different perspective, perhaps thinking that the domme was just pushing limits. But pushing beyond the stated limits without consent is not acceptable. The author's breaking of the restraints was a reaction to being harmed, not a breach of the agreement.\n\nLegally, if it's a private contract, the author might have obligations, but ethically and in terms of safety, the domme's actions were negligent. The author has the right to refuse payment when the service provider didn't honor the agreed terms and caused harm. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the domme violated the agreed-upon safe word and caused injury, making the service incomplete and unsafe.\n"
