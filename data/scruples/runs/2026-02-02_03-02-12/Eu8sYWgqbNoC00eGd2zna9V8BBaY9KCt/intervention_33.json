I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author paid a $50 deposit for a 90-minute session with a domme, agreeing to a medium power level for ballbusting. They set up a safe word system using a ball in their hand, where dropping it would signal the domme to stop. However, during the session, the domme started doing harder kicks than agreed, the author dropped the ball (safeword), but the domme didn't stop and continued for three more kicks. The author ended up in severe pain, had to break the restraints, and was told the session was over and to pay the remaining $300. The author refused, citing the domme's failure to respect the safe word and their injury, and went to the hospital. The domme then threatened to inform the local community about non-payment, but the author's friend, also a domme, said the author is an asshole for not paying, arguing the domme just pushed limits and the author broke her equipment.\n\nFirst, the safe word is a crucial part of any consensual power exchange or kink activity. It's meant to be honored immediately. The author clearly communicated the safe word and the agreed intensity. The domme not stopping after the safe word was triggered is a serious breach of agreement. The author's safety and consent are paramount here. Even if the domme felt the author was being passive or not responding, the safe word must be respected. \n\nThe author's actions to protect themselves by breaking the restraints were necessary due to the ongoing pain and potential injury. The domme's reaction to the broken equipment seems to blame the author, but the root cause is her ignoring the safe word. The author's decision not to pay is justified because the domme violated the agreed terms. The remaining $300 is still owed for the session time used, but the author's right to self-defense and safety is more critical. \n\nThe friend's opinion that the author is in the wrong might be based on the idea that the domme could push limits as part of the role, but that's not acceptable when the safe word is ignored. The domme is responsible for ensuring the client's well-being and adhering to safety protocols. The author's choice to prioritize their health and withdraw from the session is reasonable. The domme's threat to harm the author's reputation is also problematic, as it's an attempt to coerce payment without addressing the main issue of safety violation.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author isn't in the wrong. The domme breached the agreement by not stopping when the safe word was triggered, leading to the author's injury. The author's refusal to pay is a direct result of that breach, and their actions were necessary for their safety. Answer B.\n"
