I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the story is in the wrong for not paying the Domme after the session. \n\nFirst, the setup: The Domme didn't ask for payment upfront, only a $50 deposit. The user agreed to a session with specific limits\u2014medium power maximum. The safe word was dropping a ball, which would signal the Domme to stop. During the session, the Domme went beyond the agreed limits, causing severe pain. The user dropped the ball (the safe word) but the Domme continued, leading to injury. The user then left without paying the remaining $300, got medical attention, and the Domme threatened to report him for non-payment.\n\nThe key points here are the agreed-upon terms. The user set limits, communicated them, and used the safe word. The Domme ignored the safe word and exceeded the agreed intensity, which caused harm. The user ended up needing medical attention. The Domme then demands payment despite violating the agreed terms and causing injury. \n\nThe user's friend, who is a Domme, says the user is in the wrong. However, the user's argument is that the Domme didn't adhere to the agreed terms, thus making the service invalid. The user isn't paying for a service that was not provided as agreed and resulted in harm. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the Domme failed to follow the safe word protocol and went beyond the user's limits. The user had a right to use the safe word and expect it to be respected. The injury caused by the Domme's actions could also be a factor in whether the user is liable for payment. \n\nIn many service agreements, if the service provider doesn't honor the agreed terms and causes harm, the client isn't obligated to pay. Additionally, the user's decision to seek medical attention is responsible, and withholding payment in this case might be justified as the service was not delivered properly. \n\nThe Domme's threat to report the user for non-payment seems like a breach of ethical conduct, especially in a community that should prioritize consent and safety. The user isn't at fault for holding the Domme accountable for her actions. \n\nSo, considering all this, the user isn't in the wrong for not paying after the Domme ignored the safe word and caused harm. The answer should be B.\n"
