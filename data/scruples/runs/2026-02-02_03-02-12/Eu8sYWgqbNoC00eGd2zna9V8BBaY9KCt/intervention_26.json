I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a paid session with a domme where the safe word was ignored, leading to injury and non-payment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author set up a session with agreed terms, including a safe word (holding a ball) which was supposed to stop the activity. The domme continued despite the safe word being triggered, causing significant pain and injury. The author left without paying the remaining amount and faced backlash from the domme and a friend who's also a domme.\n\nLegally, contracts usually require payment unless there's a breach. But here, the domme didn't fulfill the agreed terms by ignoring the safe word, which is a critical part of their agreement. The safe word is essential for safety, and violating that could be considered a breach of contract or even negligence. The author's non-payment could be justified if the service wasn't delivered as agreed. Additionally, the domme's actions led to injury, which might make the author not liable for payment, especially if the service was unsafe or illegal.\n\nEthically, the domme's disregard for the safe word is a major issue. The author's priority was safety, which was compromised. The domme might argue that the author broke the equipment, but the primary issue here is the violation of the agreed-upon safety measures. The author's decision to seek medical help and not pay could be seen as reasonable given the circumstances.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because the domme didn't adhere to the safety agreement, leading to harm. The non-payment is justified due to the breach of contract and the domme's negligence.\n"
