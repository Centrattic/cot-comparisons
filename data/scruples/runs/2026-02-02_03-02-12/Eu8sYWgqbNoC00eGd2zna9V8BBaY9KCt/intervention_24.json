I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a paid session with a Domme where the safeword wasn't respected, leading to injury and the refusal to pay.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author paid a deposit, set up a session with clear limits (medium power max for ballbusting), agreed on a safe word using a ball. The Domme ignored the safe word after the ball was dropped, continued causing pain, and then the author didn't pay the remaining amount. The Domme is threatening to report him for non-payment and equipment damage. The author's friend, another Domme, says he's an asshole for not paying.\n\nSo, the main issues here are: 1) Did the Domme violate the agreed terms by ignoring the safe word? 2) Is the author obligated to pay despite that violation? 3) Is the author in the wrong for not paying?\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if there's a contract or agreed terms (like the safe word system), and one party breaches that contract, the other might not be obligated to fulfill their part. Here, the Domme didn't follow the agreed safe word, which is a key part of the session's safety. The author's non-payment could be seen as a breach of contract too, but if the service wasn't delivered as agreed, maybe the author isn't at fault.\n\nEthically, the safe word is crucial in such arrangements. Ignoring it could be considered negligence or assault. The author's refusal to pay might be justified because the Domme didn't adhere to the safety protocols they both agreed on. The friend's argument that the Domme just pushed his limits might not hold if she ignored the explicit safe word. Also, the equipment was broken during the session, which could be the Domme's responsibility if her actions caused it.\n\nHowever, the author did agree to the session and paid a deposit. There's a potential argument that the non-payment could be seen as breaking the agreement, but if the service was not provided properly, then it's the Domme's fault. The author's main issue is the safety violation, which could override the payment obligation.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of mutual consent and trust. If the Domme didn't respect the agreed boundaries, the author isn't at fault for not upholding their part. The threat of the Domme to report him for non-payment might be empty if she breached the agreement first.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because the Domme violated their agreed terms, and the author's non-payment is a response to that violation. The Domme's actions were unsafe, leading to harm, which justifies the author's decision not to pay.\n"
