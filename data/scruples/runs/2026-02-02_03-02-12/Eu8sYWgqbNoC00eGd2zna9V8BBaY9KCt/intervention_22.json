I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a paid session with a Domme (a dominant in a BDSM context) where the author didn't pay the remaining fee after an incident where he felt his safe word was ignored.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author agreed to a safe word system where dropping a ball would signal her to stop. During the session, the Domme allegedly ignored this signal and continued causing pain beyond his stated limits. The author then left without paying the rest of the fee and went to the hospital. The friend, who is also a Domme, said the author was wrong for not paying and breaking the restraints.\n\nNow, considering the context. In consensual non-consensual activities, there are often agreed-upon boundaries and safewords. The Domme's responsibility is to respect those boundaries. If the safe word was ignored, that's a violation of the agreed terms, which could be considered a breach of trust and safety. The author's refusal to pay might be justified because the service did not meet the agreed-upon standards, especially when it led to harm requiring medical attention. Additionally, the restraints breaking could be due to the excessive force, not the author's fault.\n\nHowever, some might argue that contracts were agreed upon, and not paying could be seen as unethical, especially if the terms were clear. But given that the author was harmed and the safe word was ignored, which is a critical safety measure, the author's actions seem to prioritize his well-being over the payment. The friend's criticism might stem from a different perspective on how to handle such situations, but the primary issue is the Domme's failure to adhere to safety protocols.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because the Domme didn't follow the agreed safety measures, leading to harm, and the author was justified in protecting himself.\n"
