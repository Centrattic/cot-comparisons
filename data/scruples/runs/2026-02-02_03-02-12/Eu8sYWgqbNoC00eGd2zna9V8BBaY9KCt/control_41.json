I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not paying the Domme after she ignored his safe word. \n\nFirst, the setup: The author paid a deposit, agreed on limits (medium power max), and set up a safe word system using a ball. The Domme, however, went beyond the agreed limits, continued after the safe word was triggered, causing significant pain and injury. The author then refused to pay the remaining amount, leading to the Domme threatening to report him in the community.\n\nKey points to consider:\n1. **Consent and Agreed Limits**: The author clearly communicated his limits (medium max) and the safe word. The Domme ignored these, which is a breach of trust and safety protocols.\n2. **Safe Word Protocol**: The safe word wasn't just a verbal signal but a physical one (dropping the ball). The Domme's failure to respond to this indicates negligence.\n3. **Physical Harm**: The author suffered physical injury (swelling, pain) due to the Domme's actions. This could be a legal issue if there's negligence or assault.\n4. **Obligation to Pay**: Typically, in service transactions, payment is expected for the service rendered. However, if the service was unsafe or harmful, the obligation might be waived. The author's refusal could be justified if the Domme didn't provide the agreed service safely.\n5. **Friend's Perspective**: Another Domme's opinion that the author is an asshole for not paying might be based on the idea that limits were tested, but that doesn't negate the breach of agreed terms and safety.\n\nLegal and ethical considerations: The Domme's actions could be considered assault if she intentionally caused harm. The author's refusal to pay could be seen as a response to a failure to provide a safe service. However, in a court, the author would need to prove that the service was unsafe and not as agreed.\n\nBut the question is about being \"in the wrong\" morally or ethically. Since the Domme violated the agreed terms and caused harm, the author's refusal to pay is justified. The Domme's threats might be retaliatory, but the author's safety comes first. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the Domme failed to adhere to the agreed terms and caused harm, making the payment obligation null."
