I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author went to a Domme for a ballbusting session. They agreed on a safe word system where if he dropped the ball, she would stop. But during the session, she kept going even after he dropped the ball, causing him a lot of pain and injury. He then decided not to pay the remaining $300 because she violated his safe word. The Domme is threatening to tell the community he didn't pay and he might not get other sessions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the agreed-upon terms. The safe word system is crucial in such activities because it's meant to ensure safety. If the Domme ignored the safe word after he dropped the ball, that's a breach of agreement. She was supposed to stop immediately, but she didn't. That's a serious issue because it led to physical harm. The author ended up in the hospital, which shows the consequences were severe.\n\nThe Domme's friend (another Domme) is saying he should have paid despite the violation. But that seems problematic. If a professional ignores the agreed safety measures, they're at fault. The author has the right to expect that the safe word is respected. By not paying, he's holding her accountable for not following the rules they set together. The Domme is asking for payment for a service that was not delivered properly and caused harm. Also, the author didn't pay upfront, only a deposit, which complicates the payment issue. \n\nBreaking the restraints might be an accident due to the pain, not on purpose. The Domme is blaming him for that, but if she was the one causing the pain, that's her fault. She should be responsible for the damaged equipment if her actions led to it. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He set boundaries with the safe word, which she violated, leading to injury. He's not obligated to pay for a service that was not performed as agreed. The Domme's threat to spread that he didn't pay is an attempt to intimidate him, but it's her who acted unethically. The author's friend is wrong to support the Domme. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
