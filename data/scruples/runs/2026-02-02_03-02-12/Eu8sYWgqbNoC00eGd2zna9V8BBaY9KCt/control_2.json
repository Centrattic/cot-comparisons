I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a paid session with a Domme where the author didn't pay because the Domme ignored their safe word, leading to injury and a hospital visit.\n\nFirst, the safe word is a critical part of any consensual power exchange. The safe word was the ball in the hand, and when it dropped, the Domme should have stopped immediately. She didn't, which led to the person being injured. That's a serious breach of agreed-upon boundaries. \n\nThe Domme's actions went beyond the agreed intensity (medium max) and disregarded the safeword. Safety is paramount in these situations. If she didn't follow the agreed terms, she's at fault. The author not paying is a direct response to this violation. \n\nThe author's friend, who's a Domme, says they're an asshole for not paying. But in consensual activities, both parties must adhere to the agreed-upon terms. If the Domme didn't follow the terms, the author isn't obligated to pay. Also, breaking her equipment was a result of her actions, so she can't charge for that. \n\nThe author prioritized their health, went to the hospital, which shows they were in real danger. The Domme's threat to report them for not paying seems retaliatory when she was the one who violated the agreement. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (author not in the wrong) because the Domme failed to follow the safe word and terms, making her responsible for the incident. The author's refusal to pay is justified given the violation of safety protocols.\n"
