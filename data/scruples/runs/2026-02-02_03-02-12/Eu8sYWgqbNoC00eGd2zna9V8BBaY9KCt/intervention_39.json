I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario involves a paid session with a domme where the safe word was ignored, leading to injury and the refusal to pay.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The user paid a deposit, set clear limits for the session, and established a safe word. The domme ignored the safe word after the user dropped the ball (the agreed-upon signal to stop), leading to continued pain and injury. The user then didn't pay the remaining amount and faced backlash from the domme.\n\nSo, considering consent and safety in any activity, especially one involving physical domination, the primary issue here is the violation of agreed-upon boundaries. The safe word was meant to stop the action immediately. By ignoring it, the domme acted against the user's explicit consent, which is a fundamental aspect of any consensual activity. Even in kink or fetish play, consent can be withdrawn at any time, and the safe word is a clear signal for that.\n\nThe user's friend, another domme, argues that pushing limits is part of the role, but that's a misinterpretation. Pushing limits should still respect the set boundaries and the safe word is a non-negotiable part of the agreement. The user's injury due to the domme not respecting the safe word is a serious breach of trust and safety. \n\nThe financial aspect also matters. The user paid part of the fee upfront, but the remaining payment should be contingent on the service being provided as agreed. Since the service was not delivered properly and caused harm, withholding the remaining payment is reasonable. Additionally, the user's medical expenses and the trauma experienced should be considered. \n\nThe domme's reaction\u2014threatening to inform the community and holding the user accountable for the broken equipment\u2014seems like an attempt to shift responsibility. The user's priority was their health, which is valid. \n\nIn conclusion, the user is not in the wrong because the domme violated the agreed terms, caused harm, and the user's refusal to pay is justified under those circumstances. The safety and well-being of the participant take precedence over financial obligations when those boundaries are crossed.\n"
