I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a Domme who ignored the safe word during a session, leading to the author ending up in the hospital and refusing to pay. The author's friend, another Domme, says they're an asshole for not paying.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the key points. The author set up a session with agreed limits and a safe word system. The Domme exceeded the agreed power level, ignored the safe word (the dropped ball), continued causing harm, and then expected payment. The author refused to pay due to the violation and the resulting injury. The friend is upset because the author broke equipment and didn't pay.\n\nNow, considering the rules of such sessions, safe words are crucial for consent and safety. If the Domme ignored the safe word, that's a major breach of trust and safety. The author had the right to stop the session and seek medical help. Refusing to pay because the Domme violated the agreed terms seems justified. The Domme's actions were negligent, leading to injury, so the author isn't obligated to pay for a session that was conducted improperly. The friend's argument that the author should pay regardless doesn't hold because the Domme didn't follow the agreed-upon safety protocols. Breaking equipment might be an issue, but the main problem here is the violation of the safe word. The author's priority was their health, which is valid. So, the author isn't in the wrong; the Domme is.\n"
