I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a paid session with a Domme where the author didn't pay the remaining balance after the Domme allegedly ignored their safe word.\n\nFirst, the key points here are consent and safety protocols. The author set up a session with clear terms: they agreed to a safe word system using a ball. When the pain exceeded the agreed medium level, the author dropped the ball (the safe word signal), but the Domme continued. This is a major red flag. In any consensual power exchange, especially in activities that involve physical intensity, respecting the safe word is paramount. The Domme's failure to stop upon the safe word being triggered is a serious breach of trust and safety.\n\nNext, the financial aspect. The author paid a deposit and agreed to pay the remaining $300. However, they didn't pay because the Domme didn't follow the agreed safety protocols, which led to injury. The Domme, on the other hand, is threatening to report the author for non-payment and damaging her equipment.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if there's a contract (even verbal or implied by deposit), the author might be obligated to pay. But from an ethical perspective, the Domme violated the safety agreement, which caused harm. The author's refusal to pay could be seen as justified because the service wasn't performed as agreed. However, some might argue that the author should still pay unless there was a clear clause in the agreement about non-payment in case of safety violations. Since the story doesn't mention such a clause, the author might be in a tricky spot legally but ethically in the right for prioritizing their safety.\n\nThe friend's opinion that the author is an asshole for not paying might stem from the idea that the Domme is still entitled to payment despite the incident. But if the Domme breached the agreed terms, the author isn't at fault for not fulfilling their payment obligation once those terms were broken. The author also sought medical attention, which shows they took the incident seriously.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's a contractual obligation argument, the Domme's actions were the primary breach. The author isn't in the wrong for not paying because the service was not provided as agreed, and their health was compromised. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
