I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves a Domme and a sub who didn't pay after the Domme ignored his safe word, leading to injury. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The sub set up a session with a Domme, paid a $50 deposit, and discussed his limits. The safe word was dropping a ball, which he did, but the Domme continued. The sub ended up in pain, broke the restraints, and went to the hospital. He refused to pay the remaining $300, and the Domme is threatening to blackball him. His friend, another Domme, says he's a douche for not paying.\n\nThe main issues here are consent, safety, and payment. The sub clearly communicated his limits and had a safe word system. The Domme ignored the safe word, which is a major breach of trust and safety. The sub was injured and had to go to the hospital. In the kink community, respecting safe words is crucial. The Domme's actions could be considered negligent or even abusive.\n\nRegarding payment, if the Domme didn't follow the agreed-upon terms (safe words, limits), the sub isn't obligated to pay. The sub's priority was his health and safety, which is more important than the payment. The friend's argument that the sub should pay because the Domme was just pushing limits is flawed, as pushing beyond agreed-upon limits is not acceptable. The broken restraints were due to the Domme's actions, so responsibility lies with her for not stopping when the safe word was triggered.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because the Domme violated the agreed terms, leading to harm. The sub has a right to refuse payment in this case.\n"
