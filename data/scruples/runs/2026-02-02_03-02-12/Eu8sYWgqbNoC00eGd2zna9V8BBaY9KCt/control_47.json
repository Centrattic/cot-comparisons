I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a Domme (dominant in a BDSM context) who didn't stop when the person dropped their safe word, leading to an injury. The person then chose not to pay and got into an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The individual paid a deposit and agreed to a session with a safe word system in place. The safe word was holding a ball, and if it was dropped, the Domme should stop immediately. However, the Domme continued after the safe word was triggered, causing significant pain and possible injury. The person then didn't pay the remaining amount and went to the hospital.\n\nNow, considering consent and boundaries in BDSM. Safe words are crucial in these activities to ensure that the sub (the person submitting) can communicate their limits. If the Domme ignored the safe word, that's a serious violation of agreed-upon boundaries. The individual's health and safety should be the top priority. Even though they might have agreed to certain levels of play, the Domme exceeded those limits, leading to harm. \n\nThe other Domme friend said they should have paid, arguing that the Domme pushed their limits. But pushing beyond agreed-upon limits without respecting the safe word is a breach of trust and safety. The person wasn't wrong for not paying because the service didn't adhere to the agreed terms, and they were injured. The broken restraints might be a result of the injury, not the cause. Also, the Domme's reaction\u2014threatening to expose them for non-payment\u2014seems like she's trying to shift blame instead of taking responsibility for her actions.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, if the safe word was part of the explicit agreement and the Domme ignored it, leading to harm, the responsibility lies with the Domme. The individual's right to their body and safety is paramount. So not paying in this case could be justified as the service provided was hazardous and violated the terms they agreed upon.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They prioritized their safety and health, which is essential in any consensual activity. The Domme failed to uphold her part of the agreement by ignoring the safe word, making her the one at fault here.\n"
