I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong for not paying the Domme after she ignored their safe word. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe person is into ballbusting and set up a session with a Domme. They agreed on a safe word system where if the ball is dropped, the Domme stops. During the session, the pain becomes too much, the ball is dropped, but the Domme continues, leading to injury. The person then doesn't pay and the Domme is upset. The friend, who's a Domme, says the person is an asshole for not paying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and safety in BDSM. Safe words are crucial for communication. The person followed the protocol by dropping the ball, which the Domme was supposed to stop on. However, the Domme continued, which is a breach of their agreement. This could be considered a violation of the consent and safety protocols, which are essential in any BDSM activity.\n\nThe Domme is supposed to prioritize the sub's well-being. By ignoring the safe word, she's not respecting the limits set. The person then refused to pay because the Domme didn't follow the agreed-upon safety measures, leading to injury. The injury is a result of the Domme's actions beyond the agreed limits.\n\nThe friend's argument is that the Domme pushed limits, which is part of the role. But pushing limits doesn't mean ignoring the safe word. The safe word is a non-negotiable stop, so even if a Domme is experienced, they should adhere to it strictly. The fact that the Domme continued after the safe word was triggered is a serious issue.\n\nAlso, the person didn't pay because the service wasn't delivered as per the agreement. The Domme's actions were outside the scope of the session, so the person has a right to withhold payment. The injury adds to the justification, as the Domme's negligence caused harm.\n\nOn the other hand, the Domme might argue that she's responsible for the session's conduct and expected payment regardless. However, in a consensual power exchange, the sub's safety and limits are paramount. By ignoring the safe word, the Domme breached that trust and the agreement, making the person not at fault for not paying.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the person isn't in the wrong because the Domme failed to follow the established safety protocol, leading to injury and a breakdown of trust. The person's decision to not pay is a reasonable response given the circumstances.\n"
