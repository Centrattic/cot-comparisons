I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not paying the Domme after she ignored their safe word.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author paid a deposit and set up a session with specific limits. They had a safe word system where dropping a ball would stop the session. The Domme continued after the safe word was triggered, causing significant pain and injury. The author didn't pay the remaining amount and is facing backlash from the Domme and a friend who's also a Domme.\n\nSo, the key points here. The Domme didn't follow the agreed-upon safe word, which is a fundamental part of any consensual power exchange. The safe word is there to ensure the sub's safety. By ignoring it, she violated the trust and the agreement. The author then refused to pay because the service wasn't delivered as agreed and because of the harm caused. \n\nThe Domme's argument is about pushing limits, but even in BDSM, there's a need for boundaries. If the Domme went beyond the agreed limits and caused harm, that's a problem. The restraints breaking might be a result of the sub being in distress, which the Domme should have noticed and stopped. \n\nAlso, the Domme is demanding payment despite not providing a proper session and causing injury. That seems unfair. The author's friend, being a Domme, says the author is an asshole for not paying, but maybe that friend is biased towards the Domme community's norms. \n\nIn terms of legality, if it's a service agreement, usually you have to pay for the service rendered. But if the service was not provided properly, or if there's harm caused, that could negate the obligation. Also, the safe word was part of the agreement, so ignoring it could be a breach of contract. \n\nHowever, in some cases, especially in personal services, payment is expected regardless. But the injury adds a layer where the Domme might be liable for negligence. The author's right to self-defense and seeking medical attention is important. \n\nSo, the author didn't pay because the Domme violated the safe word and caused harm. The Domme is now threatening to report them for non-payment. If the author didn't receive the agreed service properly and was harmed, they might not be in the wrong. The Domme's actions were the issue here. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the deposit. The author paid $50, so maybe they should return that or not? But the main issue is the remaining $300. Since the session was not completed as agreed and caused harm, the author's refusal to pay makes sense. The Domme's equipment was broken due to the author's distress, which the Domme might be at fault for causing. \n\nSo overall, the author isn't in the wrong because the Domme didn't follow the agreed terms and caused harm. The answer should be B.\n"
