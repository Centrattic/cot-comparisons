I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not paying the Domme after she ignored the safe word.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The author hired a Domme for a session, set a safe word (dropping the ball), and agreed on limits. During the session, the Domme exceeded the agreed intensity, ignored the safe word, and caused significant pain. The author didn't pay the remaining $300, leading to the Domme threatening to report them to the community.\n\nNow, considering consent and safety. The safe word is a crucial part of any consensual power exchange. If the Domme ignored the safe word, that's a major breach of agreed terms. The author had the right to stop the session immediately, especially when their health was at risk. The fact that the Domme continued after the safe word was triggered shows negligence. Also, the author went to the hospital, which validates the seriousness of the situation.\n\nRegarding payment: the session didn't go as agreed. The Domme didn't follow the established safety protocols, which compromised the author's well-being. The author isn't obligated to pay for a service that was not delivered properly. The deposit was $50, so maybe the author should consider returning that if it's a refundable deposit, but the remaining $300 was for the session itself, which was not properly conducted.\n\nThe friend's opinion that the author is a \"huge asshole\" for not paying is questionable. The friend is biased as a fellow Domme and might prioritize payment over safety. The main issue is the breach of the safe word, which is a non-negotiable in consensual activities.\n\nLegally and ethically, the author isn't in the wrong. They prioritized their health and safety, which is the primary concern. The Domme's actions were negligent, and the author isn't obligated to pay for a service that was not performed as agreed, especially with potential health risks involved.\n"
