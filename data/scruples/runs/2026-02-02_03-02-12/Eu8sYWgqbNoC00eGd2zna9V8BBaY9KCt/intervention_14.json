I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a dominatrix (Domme) session where the author didn't pay after the Domme ignored his safe word.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author paid a $50 deposit for a $350 session. They agreed on light to medium ballbusting. The Domme used restraints and a ball gag. The safe word was dropping a ball. However, during the session, the Domme escalated to harder kicks and ignored the safe word when he dropped the ball. The author ended up in severe pain, had to break a restraint to stop her, and went to the hospital. Afterward, the Domme demanded the remaining $300, and the author refused to pay, leading to threats from the Domme.\n\nThe author's friend, who is also a Domme, said the author was an asshole for not paying. The author is now asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the Domme violated the agreed-upon terms by ignoring the safe word and escalating beyond the agreed limits. The safe word is a critical part of any consensual power exchange. If the Domme didn't respect the safe word, then she breached the agreement. The author had the right to stop the session due to the Domme's actions. Not paying because the service wasn't provided as agreed (due to the Domme's failure to follow the rules) seems justified. Additionally, the Domme's threats after the incident are concerning and could be considered harassment.\n\nThe author's actions of not paying and seeking medical attention are protective and reasonable given the situation. The Domme's failure to adhere to the safe word and agreed limits is a significant factor here. The friend's opinion that the author should still pay might stem from a misunderstanding of the terms or the importance of the safe word in such scenarios.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, the contract (agreement on limits, safe word) was mutual. The Domme's actions made the session unsafe and non-compliant with the agreed terms, which the author is not obligated to pay for. The author's decision to prioritize health and safety over the financial obligation is justified. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
