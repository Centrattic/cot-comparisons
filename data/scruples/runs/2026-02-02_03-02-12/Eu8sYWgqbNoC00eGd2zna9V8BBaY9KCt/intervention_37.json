I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is in their early 20s and into ballbusting, which they consider light to medium. They paid $350 for a 90-minute session with a domme. They gave a $50 deposit upfront. They discussed limits and set up a safe word using a ball\u2014holding it, dropping it to stop. During the session, the domme started with kicks, then kneeing, then a full-force kick when they said medium max. The user dropped the ball (safe word) but she kept going for three more kicks. He ended up almost passing out, breaking a restraint, and had to cover himself. She yelled at him for breaking her equipment and demanded the remaining $300. He refused to pay, went to the hospital, and later told his friend (who's a domme) that he didn't pay. His friend called him an asshole for not paying, saying the domme pushed his limits and he broke her straps.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The user thinks they aren't. Let me think about the key points here.\n\nFirst, the safe word system. In BDSM, safe words are crucial for consent and safety. The user set up a clear signal: holding the ball means continue, dropping it means stop. The domme ignored this after he dropped the ball. That's a serious breach of agreed-upon safety protocols. Even if they were engaging in consensual activities, ignoring the safe word could be considered a violation of trust and potentially dangerous.\n\nThen, the physical consequences. The user ended up in the hospital, which is a strong indicator that the session went beyond what was discussed and caused harm. The domme continued after the safe word was triggered, leading to injury. That suggests she didn't respect the boundaries set by the user.\n\nThe domme's reaction: she blamed the user for breaking her equipment and demanded payment. But if the user was following the safe word correctly and she ignored it, leading to the accident with the restraints, the fault might lie with her. Breaking the restraints could be a result of her actions, not his. If the restraints were broken because he was thrashing due to pain from her ignoring the safe word, then the domme's actions caused the damage. So the user isn't responsible for that.\n\nThe friend's opinion says the user is an asshole for not paying, but the user argues that the domme was negligent. The user's friend might be using the \"consent means you accept any consequences\" argument, but if the domme violated the agreed-upon safe word, then the consent might have been withdrawn. In that case, the user isn't obligated to pay for a session that wasn't properly conducted.\n\nEthically, the user tried to communicate their limits and the domme didn't respect them, leading to harm. The user's refusal to pay could be justified because the service wasn't delivered as agreed, and the domme was negligent. The user's safety was compromised, and they had to seek medical help. The domme's insistence on payment despite her fault makes the user's position stronger.\n\nHowever, there's a counterpoint about the payment structure. The user paid a $50 deposit, and the rest was due after. The domme might argue that the deposit is non-refundable, but if the session was not completed properly, the user could argue that they shouldn't pay the rest. Also, the domme's actions could be considered a breach of contract (they agreed to follow safe words and his limits), which could negate the obligation to pay.\n\nAnother angle is the nature of adult consensual activities. But in this case, the domme didn't respect the safe word, which is a fundamental part of consensual play. Ignoring the safe word could make the user's consent invalid once the safe word was triggered, meaning the rest of the session wasn't consensual. Therefore, the user isn't obligated to pay for a non-consensual act, even if the initial agreement was consensual.\n\nSo putting it all together: The domme's actions were in violation of their agreed-upon safety measures, leading to harm. The user is not at fault for not paying because the service was not delivered as agreed, and the domme was negligent. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
