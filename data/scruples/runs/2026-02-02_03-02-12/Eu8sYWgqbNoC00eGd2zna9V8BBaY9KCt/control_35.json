I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. First, the situation: the person paid $50 as a deposit for a 90-minute session with a Domme, agreed on medium power for ballbusting, and set up a safe word (dropping a ball). The Domme didn't stop when the safe word was triggered, continued beyond agreed limits, causing significant pain and injury. The author didn't pay the remaining $300, broke a restraint, and left without paying, leading to the Domme threatening to report them.\n\nSo, the key points are: 1. The Domme ignored the agreed-upon safe word and exceeded the stated limits. 2. The author was injured and went to the hospital. 3. The author didn't pay the full amount, which the Domme is upset about.\n\nNow, in a consensual kink scenario, both parties should adhere to agreed-upon boundaries and safety words. Ignoring a safe word is a major violation. The Domme's actions went beyond what was agreed, causing harm. The author's refusal to pay might be justified because the service was not delivered as agreed. However, there's the aspect of a broken restraint. If the restraint breaking was due to the author's thrashing (which was a result of the Domme's actions), then the responsibility might lie with the Domme. The friend who's also a Domme says the author should pay, but that's a conflict of interest. The author's health is a priority, so seeking medical attention is necessary. \n\nThe author didn't pay, but the Domme didn't fulfill their part of the agreement. The safe word was ignored, leading to injury. So, the author's not paying could be seen as justified because the Domme didn't follow the agreed terms. The breaking of the restraint might be considered the Domme's fault because she exceeded the agreed intensity. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
