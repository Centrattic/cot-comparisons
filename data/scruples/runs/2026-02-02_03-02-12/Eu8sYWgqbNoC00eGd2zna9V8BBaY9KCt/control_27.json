I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a Domme (Dominatrix) and a submissive, with the sub not paying after the Domme ignored his safe word.\n\nFirst, the setup: They agreed on a session with a safe word system\u2014a ball in the hand, drop it to stop. The Domme goes beyond the agreed limits (medium power), causing severe pain, and ignores the safe word. The sub ends up in the hospital but is okay. The Domme then demands payment, and the sub refuses, leading to threats from the Domme about not paying and being blacklisted. The sub's friend, another Domme, says the sub is in the wrong for not paying and breaking equipment.\n\nSo, the key points here are: The safe word was not honored, the Domme exceeded the agreed intensity, the sub was harmed, and the Domme is now demanding payment and threatening. The sub is refusing to pay because of the breach of safety.\n\nLegally, in many places, services rendered in a private setting for money might be considered a contract. However, if the service provider breached the agreed terms (like ignoring safety protocols that caused harm), the client might not be obligated to pay. Ethically, the Domme violated the agreed boundaries, which were crucial for the sub's safety. The sub's right to health and safety is paramount. The friend\u2019s argument that the sub should pay because the Domme did her job ignores the harm caused and the breach of trust. Also, the Domme's threats to the sub after the incident are problematic.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the Domme failed to follow the established safe words, which is a fundamental part of such arrangements. The sub's refusal to pay is a response to her negligence and disregard for his limits. The fact that the sub ended up in the hospital supports that the Domme's actions were reckless. The sub is not in the wrong for prioritizing his health and refusing to pay when the service was not performed as agreed and caused harm.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
