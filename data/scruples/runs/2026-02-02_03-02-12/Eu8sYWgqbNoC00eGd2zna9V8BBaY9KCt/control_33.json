I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not paying the domme after she ignored their safe word.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author set up a session with a domme, paid a $50 deposit, and agreed on a safe word system. The safe word was dropping a ball, which the author did when in pain. The domme continued after the safe word was triggered, causing injury. The author didn't pay the remaining $300 and the domme is threatening to report them.\n\nThe key points here are the safe word and the violation of agreed-upon limits. In BDSM, safe words are crucial for consent and safety. If the domme ignored the safe word, that's a serious breach of trust and safety protocols. The author was injured and needed medical attention, which indicates the situation was dangerous.\n\nThe domme's actions went beyond the agreed intensity, leading to harm. The author's decision not to pay is based on the domme not following the agreed terms. The friend's opinion that the author should pay doesn't seem to account for the violation of safety protocols. \n\nIn such scenarios, the responsibility lies with the domme to adhere to the agreed limits and ensure safety. By ignoring the safe word, the domme failed in her role, and the author is justified in withholding payment due to the harm caused. The author is not in the wrong for prioritizing their safety over the payment, especially since the domme breached the agreement.\n"
