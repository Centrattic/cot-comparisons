I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a Domme who didn't follow a safe word during a session, leading to pain and injury. The key points here are the use of a safe word, the agreed limits, and the aftermath.\n\nFirst, the user set up a session for ballbusting with a Domme, specifying a medium max intensity. They had a clear safe word: holding a ball. When the pain became too much, the user dropped the ball (the safe word), but the Domme didn't stop. Instead, she continued, leading to the user almost passing out and breaking restraints. The Domme then demanded the remaining payment, and the user refused, citing the violation of the safe word and the injury. The Domme threatened to report the user for not paying and damaging her equipment.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The safe word is a critical part of any consensual power exchange. When the user signaled the safe word by dropping the ball, the Domme's responsibility was to stop immediately. Her failure to do so breaches the agreed-upon safety measures. The user was in pain beyond their limit, which the Domme was supposed to respect. The injury that followed, even if not permanent, is a direct result of the Domme ignoring the safe word.\n\nRegarding payment, the user paid a $50 deposit for a $350 session. The Domme didn't receive the full payment upfront, which is unusual. The user's decision not to pay the remaining $300 seems justified because the service wasn't delivered as agreed. The Domme continued past the safe word, causing harm, so the user is not obligated to pay for a session that was compromised by her negligence. Additionally, the equipment was damaged, but that was due to the Domme's actions (overstepping and causing the user to thrash), so holding the user accountable for that seems unfair.\n\nThe friend who's a Domme says the user is in the wrong, but that might be because some in the community might prioritize payment and equipment over the client's safety. However, from a general ethical standpoint, the Domme's actions were negligent. She didn't adhere to the agreed-upon boundaries, leading to harm. The user's refusal to pay is a response to the breach of trust and safety, not just about the money. The user's health and safety are primary concerns here.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. The Domme failed to follow the safe word protocol, causing harm, and the user's refusal to pay is justified given the circumstances.\n"
