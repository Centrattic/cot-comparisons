I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not paying the Domme after she ignored their safe word. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author paid a deposit for a session with a Domme, set up a safe word system using a ball, and agreed to light to medium ballbusting. During the session, the Domme went beyond the agreed level, continued after the safe word was triggered (the ball being dropped), caused significant pain and injury, and then demanded payment. The author didn't pay, and the Domme threatened to tell the community, leading the author to seek medical help.\n\nSo, the Domme's actions went against the agreed terms. The safe word was there to stop the session immediately if the pain level was exceeded. By ignoring the safe word and continuing, the Domme breached the agreement. The author was in pain, had to stop the session, and ended up needing medical attention. The Domme then expected full payment despite not providing the agreed service. \n\nIn terms of contractual obligations, when someone agrees to a service, the client expects the service to be provided according to the agreed terms. If the provider fails to meet those terms, especially in a way that causes harm, the client isn't obligated to pay. The author's right to stop the session and not pay is valid because the Domme didn't honor the safe word and caused harm. \n\nAdditionally, the Domme's threat to retaliate by spreading negative information might be a problem, but that's a separate issue. The main point is whether the author was wrong in not paying. Since the Domme didn't provide the service as agreed and caused harm, the author is justified in not paying. \n\nThe friend's opinion that the author is an asshole might stem from a misunderstanding. The Domme's responsibility is to adhere to the agreed limits and safety measures. If she didn't, the service wasn't delivered properly. The author's priority was their health and safety, which is the most important aspect here. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong for not paying. The correct answer should be B.\n"
