I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation where they didn't pay a Domme after she ignored their safe word. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author set up a session with a Domme for $350, paid a $50 deposit. They discussed limits, specifically medium power for ballbusting. The safe word was dropping a ball, which they did after she continued past their agreed limit. The Domme kept hitting even after the safe word, causing severe pain and injury. The author didn't pay the remaining $300 and the Domme is threatening to spread negative info about them.\n\nThe key points here are the safe word being ignored and the safety agreement being breached. In consensual power exchange, especially in BDSM, safety protocols like safe words are critical. The Domme's actions went beyond the agreed limits, which the author made clear. By continuing after the safe word, she violated the trust and safety agreement. The author's decision not to pay could be seen as a refusal to pay for a service that was not delivered as agreed, especially since they were harmed. \n\nHowever, the other domme friend argues that the Domme pushed limits, which is part of the role. But pushing limits should still respect the boundaries set. The safe word is supposed to be a hard stop. The author's injury and the Domme's response (yelling and demanding payment) might tip the scales. Legally and ethically, if a service provider ignores safety protocols and causes harm, the client isn't obligated to pay. Plus, the author is seeking medical care, which is a valid reason to prioritize their health over payment. The Domme's threats to the community might also be considered harassment, but that's another angle.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because the Domme breached the agreed terms, ignored the safe word, caused harm, and the non-payment is a response to that breach. The answer should be B.\n"
