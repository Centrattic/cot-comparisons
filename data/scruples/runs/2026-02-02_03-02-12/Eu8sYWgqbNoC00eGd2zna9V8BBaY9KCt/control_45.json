I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not paying the Domme after she ignored their safe word. \n\nFirst, the situation: The person set up a session, discussed their limits (medium power max), and agreed on a safe word mechanism (dropping a ball). The Domme, however, escalated beyond what was agreed, causing significant pain. The user dropped the ball (safe word) but she continued, leading to injury. The user then left without paying the remaining $300 and the Domme is threatening to blackball them.\n\nThe key points here are consent and safety. The safe word is supposed to be an immediate stop. If the Domme ignored it, that's a serious breach of agreed-upon terms. The user's main concern was their own safety and health. They ended up needing medical attention, which shows this wasn't a minor issue. \n\nThe friend's opinion that the user is an \"asshole\" for not paying might be coming from a different perspective, possibly valuing contracts more than safety. But in situations involving physical harm, safety and well-being should take precedence over payment. Also, the Domme was at fault for not following the agreed limits and causing harm. \n\nLegally, if there was an agreement (contractual obligation) to pay, the user might be in a bind. But ethically and within the context of consensual activities, consent and safety are paramount. The Domme's actions were negligent, and the user had a right to protect themselves. The broken restraints were a result of the Domme's actions exceeding the agreed terms. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They acted to protect their health, and the Domme was responsible for her actions. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
