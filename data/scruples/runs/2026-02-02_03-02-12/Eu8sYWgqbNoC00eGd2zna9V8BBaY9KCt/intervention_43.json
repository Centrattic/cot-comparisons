I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author set up a paid session with a domme (dominatrix) for ballbusting. They agreed on a safe word system where dropping a ball would signal the domme to stop. The session went beyond the agreed intensity, the author dropped the ball (the safe word), but the domme continued, leading to significant pain and injury. The author didn't pay the remaining $300, broke some restraints, and the domme is threatening to report them for non-payment. The author's friend, another domme, says they're an asshole for not paying.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the contract between the author and the domme. They paid a $50 deposit for a $350 session. The domme didn't ask for upfront payment, which the author might have taken as a sign of trust. The key here is the agreed-upon safe word. In any BDSM context, the safe word is paramount. If the domme ignored the safe word, that's a breach of the agreed terms. The author's dropping the ball was their way of stopping the session, and the domme's continued actions after that are a serious issue. \n\nThe domme's actions went beyond the agreed intensity, leading to the author dropping the safe word. The author then suffered physical harm, had to break restraints to protect themselves, and went to the hospital. The domme is now demanding payment and threatening to report the author for non-payment and damaging property (the restraints).\n\nIn a consensual power exchange, the sub's safety and boundaries are supposed to be respected. If the domme disregarded the safe word, which was clearly communicated, that's a major violation. The author is not obligated to pay for a service that was not delivered as agreed and was potentially harmful. The broken restraints might be a liability issue for the domme, but the author's priority was their own safety.\n\nThe author's friend, another domme, is suggesting that the author should have paid regardless. However, that domme might be conflating the contractual obligation with the ethical responsibility. If the domme violated the safe word, then the entire session's terms are nullified. The author is justified in refusing payment for a session that was not conducted as agreed and caused harm. \n\nLegally, in many places, if a service provider fails to provide the agreed service (especially if it results in harm), the client isn't obligated to pay for the full amount. Additionally, the author's injury, even if minor, could be grounds for not paying because the service was harmful. The domme's threats to report the author for non-payment might be legally unfounded if the service wasn't properly provided.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't in the wrong because the domme violated the agreed safe word, causing harm, and the author is not required to pay for a service that was not delivered properly and was dangerous. The domme's actions were the root cause of the issue, so the author shouldn't be blamed for not paying.\n"
