I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a Domme (a dominant in a BDSM context) and a submissive. The author paid a deposit and agreed on a session with specific limits. The Domme didn't ask for the full payment upfront, which is a bit unusual but not unheard of. The key points here are the safe word and the Domme's actions.\n\nThe author set up a safe word system: holding a ball in their hand, and if they dropped it, the Domme would stop immediately. During the session, the Domme went beyond the agreed \"medium power\" and the author dropped the ball (the safe word), but she didn't stop. This led to the author experiencing severe pain, almost passing out, and needing medical attention. Afterward, the author refused to pay the remaining $300, leading to accusations from the Domme and another domme friend.\n\nFirst, in BDSM, consent and communication are crucial. The safe word is a fundamental part of ensuring that the submissive can control the session. The Domme's failure to respect the safe word when it was triggered by the author dropping the ball is a serious issue. Even if the Domme intended to push the author's limits, ignoring the safe word is a violation of trust and safety protocols. The author's physical harm and the need to go to the hospital indicate that the Domme's actions were dangerous and beyond reasonable limits.\n\nThe domme friend argues that the author should pay because the Domme pushed limits as expected. However, pushing limits should still respect the agreed safe word. The author not paying is a response to a breach of safety, not just a refusal of service. The Domme also damaged the author's equipment (breaking restraints), but the author was in a state of distress and couldn't prevent that. The Domme's threat to spread negative information about the author for not paying seems like harassment, especially since the service was not properly provided as per the agreement.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, if there was a contract or agreement that the safe word would be honored, the Domme's failure to do so makes her liable. The author's refusal to pay is justified because the service was not performed as agreed and resulted in harm. The author acting in self-preservation by not paying is reasonable. The domme friend's judgment that the author is an asshole is misplaced because the Domme violated the agreed terms and caused harm.\n"
