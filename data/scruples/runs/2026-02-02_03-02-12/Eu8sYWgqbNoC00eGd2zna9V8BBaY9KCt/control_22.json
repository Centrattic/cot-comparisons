I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong for not paying a Domme after she ignored their safe word. The scenario involves a BDSM session where the Domme (a dominant partner) didn't stop when the safe word was triggered, leading to the sub (the submissive person) dropping the ball (their safe word signal) but the Domme continuing the activity, which caused significant pain. The sub then refused to pay the remaining fee and is being accused by a friend who's also a Domme of being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The sub set up a session with clear limits and a safe word system. The Domme didn't stop when the safe word was triggered, which is a major issue because the safe word is supposed to be a non-negotiable stop signal. The Domme continued the activity despite the sub dropping the ball, causing the sub to be in severe pain, which led to them breaking the restraints and leaving without paying. The Domme is now threatening to report the sub for non-payment, and the sub's friend, who's a Domme, is saying the sub is wrong for not paying.\n\nNow, in BDSM relationships and play, consent and communication are paramount. The safe word is a critical part of safe, consensual play. If the Domme ignored the safe word (even if the sub's method was unconventional), that's a breach of trust and safety. The sub's decision to leave and not pay could be justified because the Domme didn't follow the agreed-upon safety protocols. However, there's also the aspect of payment. Even in such situations, the contract (payment for services) is usually expected unless there was a breach that justifies non-payment. But in this case, the Domme didn't fulfill the agreed-upon terms of stopping upon the safe word, which is a core part of the service. Therefore, the sub might have a valid reason to not pay because the Domme didn't adhere to the safety agreement, which is a fundamental part of the service. \n\nThe friend's argument that the Domme pushed the sub's limits as part of the role is a bit questionable. While some Dommes might push limits, that's only acceptable if the sub has consented to that. In this case, the sub clearly stated their limit was medium power, and the Domme exceeded that without stopping when the safe word was triggered. The breaking of the restraints was a direct result of the Domme's actions, so the sub isn't at fault for damaging the equipment. The Domme should be responsible for that if she didn't follow the agreed-upon safety procedures. \n\nSo, considering all this, the sub is not in the wrong. The Domme violated the agreed-upon safety rules, leading to harm, and the sub's refusal to pay is justified because the service was not performed as contracted. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
