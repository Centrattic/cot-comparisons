I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not paying the domme after she ignored his safe word. The situation involves a consensual power exchange scenario, but things went wrong when the domme continued after he dropped the safe word.\n\nFirst, the key points here are consent and safety protocols. The safe word is a crucial part of BDSM practices. The author clearly communicated his limits, and the domme agreed to stop if he dropped the ball. When he did drop it, she didn't stop, leading to significant injury. That's a serious violation of their agreed-upon safety measures.\n\nThe domme's actions went beyond what he consented to. Even if there's a common understanding in the community that dommes might push limits, the author explicitly set his maximum as medium. The fact that she continued after he triggered the safe word shows a disregard for his boundaries, which is a serious breach of trust and safety.\n\nAlso, the author isn't paying because the service wasn't performed as agreed. The domme didn't adhere to the agreed terms, so the author isn't obligated to pay the remaining fee. The domme's equipment being broken was a result of the author's injury, which she caused by ignoring the safe word. Therefore, the author's refusal to pay seems justified.\n\nThe friend's argument that the author should pay because the domme pushed his limits is flawed. Pushing limits shouldn't override the safe word. The safe word is non-negotiable once triggered. The domme's responsibility is to stop immediately, not continue. The author's health and safety come first, so he's not in the wrong for not paying.\n"
