I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in a situation involving a dominatrix who didn't respect their safe word. First, I need to understand the scenario thoroughly.\n\nThe author paid a deposit of $50 for a session with a Domme, and the total was $350. They agreed on the level of intensity for ballbusting and set up a safe word system using a ball. When the Domme went beyond the agreed medium power, the author dropped the ball (their safe word) but she continued. They ended up in significant pain, broke the restraints, and then left without paying the remaining $300. The Domme is now threatening to report them for not paying, and the author's friend, who is also a Domme, is telling them they should have paid despite the incident.\n\nThe key points here are the safe word being ignored and the physical harm caused. Safe words are crucial in BDSM practices for consent and safety. If the Domme didn't stop when the safe word was triggered, that's a serious breach of agreed-upon boundaries. The author's decision not to pay could be seen as a refusal to support someone who violated their safety. However, the financial aspect is also important. The author received a service (even if it was harmful) and might feel they shouldn't pay, but the Domme might claim the deposit is non-refundable or that they have a right to the remaining fee for the session provided.\n\nBDSM activities rely heavily on trust and prior agreements. The Domme's role is to respect the sub's limits and stop upon any safe word indication. By continuing after the safe word was used, she breached that trust and potentially caused harm. The author's friend suggests that pushing limits is part of the Domme's role, but that's only if done within the agreed terms. The author's injury (testicles swelling) supports their claim of harm. Legally, there might be issues about the service not being completed as per the agreement, but ethically, the Domme's actions were negligent.\n\nSo, the author's not paying is a response to the Domme's failure to adhere to their safety protocols. The friend's judgment that the author is an asshole is based on the expectation that payment is required regardless of the incident, which might not consider the ethical implications of the Domme's behavior. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing to pay after the Domme ignored their safe word and caused harm.\n"
