I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not paying the Domme after she ignored his safe word. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author arranged a paid session with a Domme for a ballbusting session. He set a safe word system using a ball in his hand. During the session, the Domme went beyond his stated limits, caused him severe pain, and ignored the safe word when he dropped the ball. The author ended up in the hospital but was lucky nothing was damaged. He refused to pay the remaining $300, and the Domme threatened to report him. His friend, another Domme, said he was in the wrong for not paying and for breaking equipment.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author had established a safe word system, which the Domme was supposed to respect. Her ignoring the safe word and exceeding his limits is a major issue. The Domme's actions led to him needing medical attention, which is serious. The author's refusal to pay could be seen as justified because the service provided was harmful and violated agreed-upon boundaries. However, the Domme's side might argue that the equipment breaking was his fault, hence the demand for payment and for compensation.\n\nBut consent and safety are paramount in such activities. By ignoring the safe word and causing harm, the Domme breached the agreement. The author prioritizing his health and safety by not paying makes sense. The friend's criticism might stem from different views on consent and responsibility, but the author's actions were about self-preservation. So, I think the author is not in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
