Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person told their sister's boyfriend that the sister was cheating on him. The sister has a history of cheating, and the boyfriend is a friend from the film society. The author felt that by not telling the boyfriend, they were letting him get hurt, so they decided to inform him. Now, their sister and mom are upset and have been abusive towards them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Was the author justified in revealing the cheating? On one hand, they might have thought they were protecting their friend from being cheated on again. The sister's past behavior could indicate a pattern, so the author might have felt it was necessary to prevent harm. But on the other hand, the sister's privacy is a factor. The author is a family member, but is it their place to disclose such information without the sister's consent?\n\nThen there's the impact. The boyfriend was thankful but hurt, and the relationship ended. The sister and mom are angry, leading to family conflict. The author is facing verbal abuse and threats. The sister is being cruel, which adds to the emotional toll on the author. \n\nLegally, there might not be a violation, but ethically, it's a gray area. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing by protecting a friend, but they could have overstepped by not discussing it with their sister first or involving other family members. Also, the sister's privacy and right to handle her own affairs is a point. \n\nAnother angle: Did the author have a duty to intervene? Since the boyfriend is a friend, the author might feel responsible. However, intervening without the sister's consent breaches confidentiality. Even if the sister's behavior is problematic, the author's action might be seen as crossing a boundary.\n\nThe sister's reaction, including name-calling and targeting the author's insecurities, is abusive. The mother's threat to kick them out, though stopped by the father, shows the severity of the family conflict. The author stands by their decision because they don't regret it, believing they helped their friend.\n\nIn summary, the author's intent was to prevent harm, which is a noble cause, but the method involved disclosing private information without the sister's consent. This raises questions about respecting privacy and autonomy. Depending on the cultural or personal values of the family, the author might be seen as right for protecting a friend or wrong for betraying their sister's trust.\n"
