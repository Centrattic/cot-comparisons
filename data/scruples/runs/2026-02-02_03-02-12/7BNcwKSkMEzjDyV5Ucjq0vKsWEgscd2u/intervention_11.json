Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend that she's cheating. The situation is that the sister has a history of cheating, and the author, who used to know the boyfriend from a film society, decided to inform him. Now, the family is upset with the author, especially the sister and mom, but the author doesn't regret it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Cheating is a serious issue, and if the author had evidence that their sister was definitely cheating, they might be protecting the boyfriend from being hurt. But did the author have confirmation? The story just says \"I found out,\" but the source isn't specified. If it's just the author's suspicion without proof, that could be problematic. However, if there's solid evidence, then maybe the author is justified.\n\nNext, the relationship dynamics. The author was a friend of the boyfriend before the relationship started. Does that give them the right to intervene? Friends can sometimes feel responsible for each other's well-being. But sharing someone else's personal information, even if it's a friend, can breach trust. The sister might have expected the author to keep her secrets. \n\nThen there's the family reaction. The mom threatened to kick the author out, and the sister is being cruel. That's a significant personal consequence. But the author's intention was to help a friend, not to meddle in the family. However, the author is part of the family, so their actions affect family relations. \n\nAlso, the use of derogatory terms like \"slut\" is a red flag. The author's judgment of the sister might cloud their objectivity. Maybe the sister was in the wrong, but the author's approach could have been better. Instead of directly telling the boyfriend, perhaps talking to the sister first to understand the situation or encouraging her to be honest.\n\nBut on the other hand, if the sister was clearly cheating and the author knew the boyfriend was a good person, intervening might be seen as a moral action. The boyfriend was thankful, which suggests he appreciated the heads-up. However, the author might have overstepped by not giving the sister a chance to address the issue herself or by not being sure of the facts.\n\nAnother angle: confidentiality. Even if the sister is cheating, the author's role in the sister's life might mean they should keep such information private. Unless there's a danger to others, which in the case of cheating, might not be clear. The boyfriend has the right to know, but the author's method of disclosure could be questioned. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the author had valid reasons and evidence, and if there were other ways to handle it. If the author acted out of concern and had proof, then maybe not wrong. If it was a betrayal of trust without good reason, then maybe they are. The story doesn't provide all the details, but the boyfriend was thankful, which leans towards the author being in the right. However, the sister's side isn't known. The author might not be in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
