Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who told their sister's boyfriend about the cheating is in the wrong. The situation is that the sister has cheated before, and the author, who used to be friends with the current boyfriend, found out and told him to prevent him from getting hurt. Now the sister and mom are upset, and the author is being called names, but they don't regret it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Telling someone that their partner is cheating is a breach of privacy. Siblings have a duty of confidentiality, so by sharing that information, the author might have crossed a line. However, some might argue that protecting a friend from being cheated on is justified. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister's actions of cheating are her own choice, but the author's decision to inform the boyfriend could be seen as interfering. The consequences are that the relationship ended, and the family is now in conflict. The author's justification was to protect the friend, which is understandable, but did they have the right to do so without the sister's consent?\n\nLegal perspectives usually side with the idea that sharing such information without permission is a privacy violation. Even if the intentions were good, the act itself is generally considered a breach. So ethically, it's a gray area, but legally and in terms of trust within a family, the author might be seen as overstepping. \n\nThe sister's response, including name-calling and targeting the author's insecurities, is also problematic, but that doesn't necessarily absolve the author of wrongdoing. The key point is whether the author had the right to disclose that information. \n\nConsidering all angles, while the motive was to protect a friend, the method involved violating the sister's privacy and potentially breaking trust. So, the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
