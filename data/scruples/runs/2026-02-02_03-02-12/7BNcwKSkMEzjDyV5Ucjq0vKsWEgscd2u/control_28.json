Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author did the right thing here. So the situation is that the person told their sister's boyfriend that she was cheating on him. The sister has a history of cheating, and the author felt bad for the boyfriend, who's also an old friend. The author's family is upset, and the sister is being really harsh.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Was the author right to intervene? On one hand, cheating is a serious issue, and the boyfriend had a right to know he was being cheated on. The author might have thought they were helping a friend. But on the other hand, the author didn't have the sister's consent to share that information. Family privacy is a big deal, and siblings might have some boundaries. Even if the sister's actions are wrong, the author crossed a line by revealing her infidelity without her permission. \n\nAlso, the aftermath is causing tension in the family. The mom threatened to kick the author out, and the sister is being cruel. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing, but they didn't consider the consequences for their own family dynamics. Even if the sister was unfaithful, the author's method of handling it was problematic. \n\nThere's a balance between loyalty to a friend and respecting a sibling's privacy. The author might have felt justified, but in most cases, people are expected to handle such sensitive information discreetly, especially within the family. The sister's behavior is wrong, but the author's actions don't make it right. So, the answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
