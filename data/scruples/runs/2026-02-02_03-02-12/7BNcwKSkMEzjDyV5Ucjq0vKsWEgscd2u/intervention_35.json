Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend that she's cheating. The situation is that the sister has cheated on multiple partners, and the author, who knew the current boyfriend from the past, decided to inform him after finding out about the cheating. The sister and mom are upset, and there's family tension now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. Telling someone that their partner is cheating is a breach of privacy. Even if the sister's actions are wrong, the author had a duty to keep that information private unless there was a direct impact on them. The author's intention was to protect a friend, which is understandable, but did they have the right to do that?\n\nConfidentiality is a big deal. Siblings can share personal information, but does that extend to sharing cheating behavior with the other person's partner? The sister might expect that her actions are kept between her and the people she's directly involved with. By sharing it with the boyfriend, the author overstepped a significant privacy boundary.\n\nAlso, the fallout is causing family conflict. The sister and mom are upset, and the author is now facing verbal abuse and threats. While the sister's actions are unethical, the author's decision to disclose without consent could be seen as equally problematic. The author might have felt justified, but the method of handling it\u2014telling the boyfriend directly\u2014might not be the best approach. Maybe a better approach would be to talk to the sister first, try to get her to confront the issue, or at least seek advice from a trusted adult or mediator.\n\nThe author's motivation was to protect a friend, but that doesn't necessarily make the action right. There's a responsibility to respect others' privacy, even if they're doing something wrong. The boyfriend was hurt, but the author's intervention could have been a violation of the sister's privacy and the trust between siblings.\n\nSo, while the sister's cheating is wrong, the author's decision to inform the boyfriend without her consent is a breach of trust and privacy. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong. The correct answer would be A.\n"
