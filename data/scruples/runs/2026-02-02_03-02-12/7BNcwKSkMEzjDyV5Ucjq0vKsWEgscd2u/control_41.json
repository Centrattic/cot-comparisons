Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (AITA) who told their sister's boyfriend about her cheating is wrong. The situation involves the sister being unfaithful multiple times, and the author decided to inform the boyfriend out of concern. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of trust and privacy. The sister's actions are undoubtedly wrong, but the author's decision to reveal this information to the boyfriend raises ethical questions. The key points here are confidentiality and the right to know.\n\nThe author is a family member, but they weren't directly wronged by the sister's actions. They might have felt compelled to act to protect their friend. However, sharing someone else's private information without their consent can be a breach of trust. The sister's right to privacy versus the boyfriend's right to know are conflicting here. \n\nIn many cases, people argue that a partner has the right to know about infidelity. But the author's role as a third party complicates things. Even if the intention was good, the method might be questionable. The sister and her family are upset because the author didn't respect their privacy, which could have worsened family relationships. \n\nAnother angle is whether the author should have approached the sister first, perhaps encouraging her to be honest. However, if the sister is in denial or doesn't take responsibility, that might not work. The author's action led to the breakup, which the boyfriend was grateful but hurt. \n\nLegally and ethically, there's a debate. Some might say the author did a good deed by preventing further harm. Others might argue that it's none of their business and that they overstepped. The consequences for the author, like family conflict, are significant. \n\nConsidering all these factors, the answer hinges on whether the author's action was justified by the intention to protect a friend versus violating the sister's privacy. There's no clear right or wrong here, but the ethical dilemma is central. The author's lack of regret suggests they stand by their choice, but the fallout shows the complexity of such decisions.\n"
