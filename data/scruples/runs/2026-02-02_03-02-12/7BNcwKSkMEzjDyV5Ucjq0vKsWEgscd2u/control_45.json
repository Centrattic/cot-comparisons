Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who told their sister's boyfriend about her cheating is in the wrong. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The sister has a history of cheating, and the author felt compelled to inform the boyfriend to protect him. The sister and mom are upset, calling the author names, and there's family tension. The boyfriend was thankful but hurt, and they broke up.\n\nThe key points here are: Is the author justified in revealing the sister's infidelity? Did they have a right to intervene? The sister's privacy versus protecting the boyfriend from being hurt. Also, the family's reaction\u2014mom threatening to kick him out, sister bullying him. But the author stands by their decision, feeling it was the right thing to do.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a debate. On one hand, the sister's privacy is a concern. On the other hand, the boyfriend has a right to know if his partner is unfaithful. The author acted as a friend to the boyfriend, which could be seen as a protective gesture. However, the fallout is significant, affecting family dynamics and the author's well-being.\n\nBut legally, there's no law against revealing such information, though it can be morally contentious. The question is whether the author overstepped by sharing personal information without the sister's consent. However, given the sister's pattern, maybe the author believed it was necessary to prevent further harm. The boyfriend was grateful, which suggests he appreciated the honesty.\n\nThe family's anger is more about the breach of trust within the family. But does that mean the author was in the wrong? It's a gray area. Some might argue that the author did the right thing to protect a friend, while others might say it's meddling in family affairs without the right to do so.\n\nConsidering all angles, the answer could go either way. However, the fact that the sister had a history of cheating and the author's intention was to prevent harm might lean towards B (not in the wrong). The boyfriend being thankful supports that. But the family's reaction is also valid, showing the personal impact. However, the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" not about the consequences. So, it's more about whether the action was ethically wrong. Since the author's intention was to protect a friend and the boyfriend was grateful, the answer is likely B.\n"
