Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who told their sister's boyfriend about the cheating is in the wrong. The situation is that the sister has cheated before, and the author, knowing this, told her current boyfriend. The sister and mom are upset, but the author doesn't regret it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Telling someone that their partner is cheating is a breach of privacy. Even if the sister's behavior is questionable, the author didn't have the authority to expose her without her consent. The sister might have expected her brother to keep her secrets, so breaking that trust could be wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to protect his friend from getting hurt. He might believe that the boyfriend had a right to know the truth. However, even with good intentions, the act of revealing private information without consent can be seen as a violation of trust. \n\nThe family's reaction\u2014screaming, calling names, threatening to kick him out\u2014shows the severity of the breach. The mother and sister feel betrayed, which is understandable. The author's actions caused a family conflict, which is a significant consequence. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the sister's pattern of behavior. If she's cheated multiple times, maybe the author felt it was necessary to intervene. However, the right to privacy is still a factor here. The author's decision to act as a mediator in someone else's relationship is problematic. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author might have overstepped by not discussing this with the sister first. Even if she's done wrong, others have a right to privacy. The author's action disrupted the relationship between the boyfriend and sister, which had consequences he might not have foreseen. \n\nI think the key points are consent and privacy. The author didn't have the sister's permission to share her secrets, so even if the intent was good, the act itself is ethically questionable. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
