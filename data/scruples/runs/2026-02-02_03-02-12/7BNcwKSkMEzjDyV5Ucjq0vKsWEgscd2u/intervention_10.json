Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The user's sister has a boyfriend, who is also a friend of the user. The sister has a history of cheating, and the user found out she was cheating again on this latest boyfriend. The user then told the boyfriend about the cheating, which led to the breakup. Now, the sister and the user's mom are angry, even threatening to kick the user out, and they're being verbally abusive. The user stands by their decision, feeling they did the right thing to protect their friend.\n\nFirst, let's consider the user's actions. They had information about their sister being unfaithful to a mutual friend. The user's intention was to prevent their friend from being hurt, which is a common justification for such actions. However, the user didn't go through the sister to address the issue; they went straight to the boyfriend. That could be seen as a breach of privacy, as they're sharing personal information without the sister's consent. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister's behavior is problematic. Cheating multiple times shows a pattern of dishonesty and harm towards her partners. The user's friend was left hurt, and the user felt compelled to intervene. The question is whether the user overstepped by not discussing this with the sister first or maybe giving her a chance to address the issue before informing the boyfriend. \n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a debate between loyalty to family versus protecting friends. The user chose to protect the friend, which might be seen as noble, but it's also a violation of the sister's privacy. The user didn't seek to mediate the situation between the sister and the boyfriend, which could have been a middle ground. Instead, they took a direct approach, which might have been necessary if the sister was unlikely to change or confront the issue on her own. \n\nAnother angle is the aftermath. The user is facing backlash from their family, which adds emotional stress. The sister and mom's reaction could be exacerbated by the sister's guilt or fear of consequences. The user's decision to come forward might have been the right thing for the friend, but it's causing family discord. \n\nLegally, there's no issue here unless there's a violation of privacy laws, but in a familial context, the main concern is ethical. The user's actions could be seen as a breach of trust with their sister, as they didn't confide in her first. However, the sister's repeated infidelity might have justified the user's actions to protect the boyfriend. \n\nIn summary, the user's intention was to prevent harm to a friend, which is a valid concern. However, the method of intervention (going directly to the boyfriend without involving the sister) might be where the ethical dilemma lies. It's a tough call between protecting a friend and respecting family privacy. Depending on the perspective, the user could be seen as either acting in a friend's best interest or overstepping their bounds.\n"
