Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person wrote in about telling their sister's boyfriend she's cheating. The sister has a history of cheating, and the author, who used to know the boyfriend, felt it was right to tell him. Now the sister and mom are angry, even threatening to kick them out.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Hmm. Well, privacy is a big factor here. Siblings might share info, but sharing someone else's cheating to a partner without their consent could be tricky. The sister is the one cheating, but the author took it upon themselves to expose her. On one hand, they were protecting a friend. On the other, they violated their sister's privacy. But the sister has a pattern, so maybe the author felt justified. However, the consequences for the author are pretty harsh, and maybe they overstepped. But the sister's actions are also problematic. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author had the right to disclose that information without consent. Since it's a private matter between the sister and her partners, the author might have overstepped even with good intentions. So maybe the answer is A (they're in the wrong). But some might argue that they were helping a friend. However, the sister's privacy was breached, so the author's actions could be seen as wrong even if the sister is at fault. So probably A.\n"
