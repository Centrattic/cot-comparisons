Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who told their sister's boyfriend about her cheating is in the wrong. The situation is that the sister has a history of cheating, and the author decided to inform the boyfriend to protect him. Now the family is upset, with the sister and mom being angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author's intention was to prevent the boyfriend from being hurt further. That might be seen as a good motive. However, the author didn't ask the sister's permission, so it's an invasion of her privacy. In many cases, people have a right to privacy, even if they've done something wrong. \n\nThen, the relationship dynamics. The sister's actions are definitely wrong (cheating), but the author's action of revealing the secret could break trust within the family. The author might argue that they were protecting a friend, but family loyalty is also important. \n\nLegal perspective: There's no legal issue here since it's about personal relationships. But morally, it's a gray area. The author might be seen as overstepping by not consulting the sister first, but also helping a friend avoid more pain. \n\nConsequences: The family is now fractured, with the author facing hostility. The sister's reaction is harsh, which might be because she's upset about her privacy being violated and possibly losing the relationship. \n\nDifferent viewpoints: Some might say the author did the right thing by being honest with the boyfriend. Others might think the author should have addressed it with the sister first, maybe trying to help her instead of exposing her. \n\nAlso, considering the sister's history, maybe there's a pattern of behavior that the author felt needed to be stopped. But the method of intervention was direct and without consent. \n\nIn summary, the author's action was driven by a desire to help a friend, but crossed into the sister's personal life without her consent. While the sister's cheating is wrong, the author's disclosure could be seen as violating confidentiality. So, the answer might depend on whether protecting the friend justifies the breach of family trust.\n"
