Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The question is whether the author did the right thing by telling his sister's boyfriend about her cheating. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but they want my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The sister has a history of cheating, and the author felt compelled to inform the boyfriend to protect him. The author's motivation seems to be out of concern for the friend, since they were part of the same film society. \n\nNow, from a moral standpoint, is it ever okay to reveal someone's infidelity? Well, people often debate this. On one hand, the boyfriend has a right to know if his partner is cheating. On the other hand, the author might have breached privacy without the sister's consent. But in this case, the sister was already unfaithful, so the author might feel justified in exposing the truth to prevent further harm. \n\nThe consequences are that the couple broke up, which might have been inevitable, but the author now faces backlash from his family. The sister and mom are angry, and the mother even threatened to kick him out. The author's justification is that he didn't want his friend to be hurt. \n\nBut does that outweigh the importance of family loyalty? In some cultures or families, protecting family is paramount, even if they're in the wrong. However, others might prioritize truth and honesty. \n\nI need to check if there's any legal aspect here. In some places, there are laws against interfering in someone's relationship, but I think that's more about physical harm than just revealing infidelity. Legally, it might not be a violation, but morally, it's a gray area. \n\nThe author's actions could be seen as a breach of trust with his sister, but he's defending his friend's interests. The sister's actions were also unethical, so the author might feel justified in exposing her. However, the method of disclosure\u2014texting the boyfriend directly\u2014might be seen as a betrayal by the sister and family, even if the content was true. \n\nAnother angle: Did the author have the right to act as a moral judge here? Some might say that the boyfriend should have discovered the cheating on his own, but others would agree that the author helped prevent ongoing emotional harm. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author might have acted with good intentions, the act of intervening without the sister's consent could be seen as overstepping. However, given the sister's repeated cheating and the desire to protect a friend, the author's actions could be justified. The answer depends on whether the right to protect a friend outweighs the duty to keep a family member's secrets. Given the sister's history, the author's action might be more understandable. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
