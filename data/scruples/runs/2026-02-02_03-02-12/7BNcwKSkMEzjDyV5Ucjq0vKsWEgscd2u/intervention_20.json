Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend that she was cheating. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the sister has a history of cheating on multiple boyfriends. The writer, who used to be friends with the current boyfriend, found out and decided to inform him. The reasoning was to prevent the friend from getting hurt. The boyfriend was thankful but hurt, and they broke up. Now, the sister and mom are angry, even threatening to kick the writer out, though the dad intervened. The writer feels they did the right thing despite the backlash.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the writer might have acted out of concern for their friend, trying to protect him from being cheated on again. The sister's pattern suggests this isn't an isolated incident, so maybe the writer felt it was justified. Also, the boyfriend was grateful, so maybe the action had a positive outcome.\n\nOn the other hand, the writer did reveal confidential information without the sister's consent. Even if the sister's actions were wrong, the writer's intervention might have crossed a boundary. They might have violated trust between siblings, leading to family conflict. The sister's retaliation, like making fun of the writer's weight, is harsh, but that doesn't necessarily make the writer right.\n\nEthically, it's a gray area. The intent was good\u2014to protect a friend\u2014but the method involved breaching privacy. The question is whether the ends justify the means. Some might argue that preventing harm to the boyfriend is more important than maintaining family harmony. Others might say that the writer should have tried to address the sister's behavior first, perhaps by confronting her or seeking advice from a parent before taking action.\n\nAlso, the family's reaction is intense. The mom threatening to kick them out and the sister's cruel remarks suggest deep family tensions. The writer might have overstepped, even with good intentions, leading to more harm within the family. However, the boyfriend's gratitude indicates that the action helped him avoid further hurt.\n\nIn the end, it's tricky. The writer's action had consequences both for the boyfriend and their own family. Whether they're in the wrong depends on the value placed on privacy versus protecting a friend. I think the writer's intention was to help, but the method might be questionable. However, given the sister's repeated cheating, the writer might feel justified. The answer could swing either way, but considering the outcome for the boyfriend and the sister's history, maybe the writer isn't entirely in the wrong.\n"
