Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for telling their sister's boyfriend she's cheating. The sister has a history of cheating, and the person felt the boyfriend deserved to know. The sister and mom are upset, but the person doesn't regret their actions.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the sister's cheating history, the person's intention to protect the boyfriend, and the fallout. Legally, I don't think there's a law against this, but ethically it's murkier. Telling someone about infidelity is often a personal choice. The sister's actions are wrong, but the person stepping in might have crossed a line by revealing private information.\n\nOn one hand, the boyfriend had a right to know if his partner was cheating. On the other, the person might have violated their sister's privacy. But the sister had a history of cheating, so maybe the person felt justified. The response from the sister and mom being angry is understandable, especially if they didn't know about the sister's past. However, the intention was to protect a friend, which adds complexity.\n\nI think the person's action was a moral choice, but whether it's right depends on context. If the sister's cheating was known within the family, maybe the person had a duty to inform the boyfriend. But if the sister kept it secret, then revealing it was an invasion of privacy. Since the sister had cheated before, the person might have thought it necessary to prevent more harm. The boyfriend was thankful, so maybe it was the right call despite the family's anger. So, probably not in the wrong.\n"
