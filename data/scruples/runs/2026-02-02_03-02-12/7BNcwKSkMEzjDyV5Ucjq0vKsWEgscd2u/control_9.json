Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend that she's cheating. The sister has a history of cheating, and the author felt bad for their friend. They told the boyfriend, which led to a breakup and now family conflict.\n\nHmm. The main question is about privacy and boundaries. The sister is an adult, so is it the author's place to intervene? On one hand, the author might think they're protecting their friend from being hurt. But on the other hand, they broke their sister's privacy. Even if the sister is acting poorly, the author didn't have her permission to share that information. The boyfriend has the right to confront his girlfriend himself, even if it's hard.\n\nAlso, the sister and mom are upset because of the betrayal. The author might not be in the wrong morally, but legally and socially, they overstepped. They could have advised their friend to confront their girlfriend directly instead of revealing the secret. The author's actions caused family issues, which is a consequence they have to deal with, even if they don't regret it. So, while the intention was good, the action was a breach of trust. So, probably answer A, yes, they are in the wrong.\n"
