Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The main issue is whether they had the right to tell their sister's boyfriend about her cheating.\n\nFirst, the sister has a history of cheating, which the author is aware of. The author's motivation was to protect a friend from being hurt, which seems noble. But did they overstep? Telling someone's partner about their cheating without the person's consent is a big deal. It's their relationship, so the boyfriend had the right to know, but the author went around the sister and told him directly. \n\nOn one hand, the sister is clearly upset because her privacy was violated. Cheating is a serious issue, but the author's action might have caused more family conflict than necessary. The sister and mom are reacting strongly, even with threats and name-calling, which is extreme. The author's dad intervened, which is a positive point.\n\nBut the author's intention was to help a friend. They might have been acting out of care, but did they have the right to do so? Ethically, it's a gray area. In some cultures or families, such actions might be seen as protecting a friend's interests, while others value privacy and boundaries more. \n\nThe author doesn't regret their actions, which suggests they believe they did the right thing. However, the fallout is significant, causing family tensions. Maybe the right approach was to discuss it with the sister first or support the friend in other ways. But since they didn't know the sister would react so harshly, it's hard to judge.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not a clear yes or no. But considering they acted to prevent harm to their friend, perhaps the author isn't entirely in the wrong. Still, without consent, it's a breach of trust. So maybe they are partially at fault. But the question is binary, so I need to choose between A and B.\n"
