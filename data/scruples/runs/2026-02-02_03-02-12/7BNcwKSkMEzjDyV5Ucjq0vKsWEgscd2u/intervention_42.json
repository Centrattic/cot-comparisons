Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend that she's cheating. Their sister has a history of cheating, and the author felt it was right to warn the boyfriend to protect him. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Tattling on someone's partner isn't typically encouraged, but there's a context here. The sister's cheating has a pattern, not just a one-time thing. The author's motivation was to prevent the boyfriend from getting hurt, which is a good intention. But did they overstep? \n\nIn most cases, people are expected to keep their family's private matters confidential unless there's a good reason to disclose. However, in this scenario, the sister's actions are harmful, and the boyfriend is being deceived. The author might feel they're doing the right thing by protecting a friend. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of privacy. Even with bad behavior, revealing that information without consent can be seen as a breach of trust. The sister's family is upset because they feel the author violated their privacy. The boyfriend was thankful, so maybe he appreciated the heads-up. \n\nHowever, the author didn't consult with the sister first. They made the decision independently, which could have been handled differently. Maybe they could have confronted the sister first or encouraged her to address the issue herself. But given the sister's history, it's possible she wouldn't have done that. \n\nSo, weighing the intentions and the consequences: The author wanted to protect a friend from harm, which is a valid concern. The sister's cheating is problematic, and the author acted to prevent ongoing harm. The family's reaction is harsh, but if the sister's actions are malicious, the author might be justified. \n\nStill, there's the question of whether they had the right to disclose such personal information. But in cases of deceit and potential harm, some might argue that protecting someone else takes precedence over privacy. \n\nI think the answer depends on cultural norms and personal ethics. But given the situation, the author's actions were to prevent harm, so they might not be in the wrong. But others might disagree, thinking they shouldn't have interfered. The boyfriend was grateful, which supports the action. So, B for No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
