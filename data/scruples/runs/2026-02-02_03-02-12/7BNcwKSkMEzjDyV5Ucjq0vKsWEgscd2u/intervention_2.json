Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told their sister's boyfriend about her cheating is in the wrong. The situation is that the sister has a history of cheating, and the author, seeing a friend (the sister's boyfriend) get hurt, decided to tell him. The family is upset, but the author doesn't regret it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Usually, people are expected to maintain confidentiality unless there's a risk of harm. But in this case, the sister's cheating could be causing emotional harm to the boyfriend. The author might have thought they were preventing further hurt by breaking it off sooner.\n\nHowever, there's the issue of consent and privacy. The author isn't the boyfriend's parent or legal guardian, so maybe they overstepped by revealing the affair without the sister's consent. Even if the intention was good, some might argue that it's not their place to meddle in the sister's relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister has a history of cheating, so the author might feel justified in protecting a friend. The boyfriend was grateful but hurt, which shows the action had consequences. The family's reaction is also important\u2014interfering in family matters can lead to conflict, but the author's motives were to help a friend.\n\nDifferent perspectives: From a deontological standpoint, lying or being deceptive is wrong, but telling the truth can be a duty. However, in relationships, people often expect discretion. Utilitarian view: the action prevented more harm to the boyfriend in the long run, but caused harm to the author's family. So it's a balance.\n\nIs there a better way? Maybe confronting the sister first, but the author might not have done that to avoid further cheating. The key points are the sister's past and the author's intent to protect a friend. Even though the action caused family strife, the intent was good. So I might lean towards the author not being in the wrong, but there's a gray area.\n"
