      "text": "Okay, let me think about this. The parent is holding onto their son's Xbox gift card because he's failing math and other classes, and they blame it on him spending too much time on Fortnite instead of doing homework. The question is whether the parent is in the wrong for doing so.\n\nFirst, the parent's intention is to motivate the child to improve his grades. Taking away access to games that are distracting him seems like a logical consequence. But is it fair? The child is 14, so a teenager. Taking away something he values might help him prioritize schoolwork. On the other hand, is there a better way to handle this? Maybe setting limits on gaming time instead of taking the gift card. However, the parent might feel this is a necessary step to prevent further decline in grades. The key points here are the parent's authority to enforce consequences and the child's responsibility to manage his time. Since the parent is trying to address the root cause of poor performance, most people might side with the parent. But some might argue that it's harsh. The question is whether the parent is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I think the parent is trying to help, so the answer is B.\n"
