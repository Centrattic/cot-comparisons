      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the parent is wrong for not giving their son the X-box gift card because he's failing math due to playing Fortnite instead of doing his homework. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the parent is withholding a gift card that the son received for Christmas. The reason is that the son is failing math and other subjects because he's spending too much time on Fortnite. The parent wants to know if they're the asshole (AITA) in this situation. The user thinks the parent isn't wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nThe parent's reasoning is that the son's academic performance is slipping, and they're trying to enforce responsibility by taking away the gaming console access. On the other hand, the son might feel that the gift card was a present and the parent shouldn't take it away, even if he's not doing well in school. \n\nI need to consider if taking the gift card is an appropriate disciplinary action. Gift cards are a form of a gift, which is different from an allowance or a reward. If the gift card was given as a Christmas present, it's a fixed item. However, the parent might be using it as a way to motivate the son to study. But does that make it right? Alternatively, maybe they should have set rules beforehand about how to earn the use of the gift card based on academic performance. \n\nIs it fair to withhold a gift after the fact because of poor performance? The son might have expected the gift card to be his, but the parent is trying to link it to responsibility. There's a balance between discipline and fairness. If the parent had discussed consequences with the child beforehand, it might be more justified. Without prior discussion, taking the gift card away now could feel like a broken promise to the child, which might affect trust. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent is concerned about the child's education. Academic success is important, and the parent is trying to intervene. The child's grades are slipping, so the parent is taking action to prevent further decline. The question is whether this action is too harsh or if it's a reasonable consequence for the child's behavior.\n\nAnother angle is the child's age. At 14, they might be developing independence, so the parent's intervention could be seen as necessary to teach accountability. However, if the parent is being overly controlling without giving the child a chance to improve or discuss the situation, it might be counterproductive.\n\nSo, considering all this, is the parent in the wrong? If the gift card was a present, taking it away without prior agreement could be seen as unfair. But if the parent is trying to encourage responsibility and academic focus, they might have a valid point. The key factors are the intent and the approach. Without clear prior expectations, withholding the gift card might not be justified. The answer might hinge on whether the parent and child had agreed on conditions for the gift card usage related to schoolwork.\n"
