      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is holding onto a gift card because their son is failing math. The reason he's failing is that he's spending all his free time on Fortnite instead of doing homework. Other grades are dropping too.\n\nSo, the question is whether the parent is in the wrong. From what I know, parents often use privileges as incentives for good behavior. In this case, the gift card is a privilege tied to academic responsibility. If the child isn't meeting expectations, removing access to things he values (like gaming) is a common disciplinary measure. \n\nBut wait, is withholding a gift a different scenario? The gift card was a Christmas present. If it's a gift, does the parent have the right to withhold it? Maybe the parent gave the gift card as part of a condition, which could be a point of contention. However, many parents set conditions on gifts to encourage responsibility. \n\nAnother angle: the child is 14, an adolescent. At this age, balancing school and social activities is a challenge. The parent's goal is to improve academic performance, which is crucial for the child's future. The approach might be strict, but the intent is to help the child develop better habits. \n\nHowever, some might argue that taking away a gift card that was given without conditions could be seen as unfair. But in many cases, parents link gifts to behavior, especially if they're concerned about the child's well-being. \n\nAlso, the child's grades are dropping in multiple subjects, indicating a pattern. The parent is trying to address this by removing a distraction. It's a form of positive reinforcement, albeit through removal of a negative trigger. \n\nSo, considering the intent, the situation, and common parenting strategies, the parent's action seems justified. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
