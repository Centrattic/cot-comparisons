Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their girlfriend over her not paying rent is in the wrong. The situation is complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the timeline: They were in a relationship where the guy covered most expenses, including rent after moving in together. The girlfriend didn't pay rent for months, citing her own financial issues. The author then kicks her out, which leads to the question of who's at fault.\n\nI should consider the expectations in relationships. The author mentions he believed the guy should pay for most things but expected some give and take. The girlfriend, however, wasn't contributing equally. When they moved in together, splitting rent is a common expectation, but she stopped paying. \n\nFinancial responsibility is a major factor here. If one partner can't contribute to shared expenses, it can strain the relationship. The author was already in a precarious financial situation after covering rent twice, which might justify his frustration. \n\nThe girlfriend's attitude is another point. She seems to expect the author to handle her financial problems without reciprocation. Her statement about it being a test to see how he'd react is concerning. Testing someone's limits in a serious situation like unpaid rent could be seen as irresponsible.\n\nHowever, relationships also require communication and compromise. The author might have handled it better by discussing the financial expectations earlier. But since he tried splitting the rent and she consistently failed to meet her share, leading to the author's financial strain, his decision to end things could be seen as reasonable.\n\nLegal aspects: If they were cohabiting, there might be legal responsibilities regarding rent. If the author was the sole leaseholder, he might have the right to ask her to leave. If they were joint tenants, it's more complicated. But the scenario suggests the author is paying full rent, possibly as the sole tenant, so he might have the legal right to ask her out.\n\nEmotional vs. practical considerations: The author made a tough decision when under financial pressure. While it's harsh, if the relationship was built on unequal contributions and the girlfriend wasn't willing to adjust, breaking up might be the only option. \n\nThe girlfriend's justification of testing him is problematic. Real-life financial emergencies are different from testing. Her lack of responsibility in paying her share when able shows a lack of commitment to the relationship's practical needs.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are aspects where communication could have improved, the author's actions were a response to ongoing financial neglect. He's not in the wrong for making a decision to protect his own financial stability when the relationship's foundation was imbalanced.\n"
