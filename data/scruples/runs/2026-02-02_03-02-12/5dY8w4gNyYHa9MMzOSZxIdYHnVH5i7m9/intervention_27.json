Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up and asking his girlfriend to leave because she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both sides. The author mentions that he was paying for most things during their relationship, including dinners, trips, and groceries, while she paid occasionally and helped with cleaning. Then, when they moved in together, she couldn't pay the rent. He ended up paying the full rent, which put him in a tough financial spot. She didn't contribute as expected, and when confronted, she gave a test-like explanation. The author then kicked her out, leading to the current situation.\n\nNow, considering the key points here. Financial responsibility in a relationship is a common topic. The author believed the guy should pay for most things but expected some give and take. When they moved in together, splitting rent is a standard practice. When his girlfriend couldn't pay, he had to cover the full amount, leading to financial strain. The girlfriend's justification of it being a test to see his reaction in tough times seems selfish and not a valid reason for not contributing.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, expecting a partner to share financial responsibilities when living together is reasonable. The author's frustration is understandable, especially when he's already in debt and helping her with her own issues. The girlfriend's approach might have been a cultural or personal belief, but it's not a justification for not meeting shared responsibilities. The author making a decision to end the relationship over this seems justified given the circumstances. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should have set clearer expectations earlier. But the situation shows a pattern over time where the girlfriend didn't meet her responsibilities. The final straw was her complete refusal to help financially despite his own struggles. The test explanation adds insult to injury, making her actions seem manipulative. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions seem reasonable given the ongoing issues and financial strain. He's not in the wrong for holding his partner accountable for her responsibilities in the relationship.\n"
