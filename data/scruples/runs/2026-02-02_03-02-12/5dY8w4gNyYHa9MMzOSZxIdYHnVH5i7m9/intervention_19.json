Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a breakup where the author kicked their girlfriend out of the apartment because she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple moved in together, and initially, they split the rent. Then the girlfriend couldn't pay her share, leading the author to pay the full rent. This caused financial strain on the author. The girlfriend's reasoning was that since she has a boyfriend, he should handle everything, which the author found unfair. The girlfriend later claimed it was a test to see how he'd react to financial emergencies.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong, so I need to evaluate both sides. From the author's perspective, they were covering all the expenses, including rent, bills, groceries, etc., and felt it was one-sided. When the girlfriend couldn't pay, the author had to take on the financial burden, which is a significant issue. The girlfriend's claim that it was a test seems manipulative and unfair, as emergencies are different from ongoing financial irresponsibility.\n\nFinancial responsibility in a relationship is usually a shared duty. If one partner is consistently not contributing, it can lead to resentment. The author's decision to end the relationship because of this seems justified, especially since it's their apartment and they were the one bearing all the costs. The girlfriend's attitude of expecting the partner to cover everything without reciprocation is problematic. The author's reaction was a response to being taken advantage of, not just a spur-of-the-moment decision. The fact that the author was already in a precarious financial situation adds to the justification.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have communicated earlier about the financial expectations. But the situation shows that the author tried to work with the girlfriend when she first couldn't pay, allowing her to pay a few hundred later but then she didn't follow through. The final refusal to contribute at all and the test comment likely pushed the author to their breaking point. \n\nSo considering all that, the author's actions seem reasonable. They were protecting their financial well-being and setting boundaries. The girlfriend's behavior was inconsiderate and exploitative. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
