Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up with a girlfriend and kicking her out of the apartment because she couldn't pay rent. The author is upset because he's been covering most expenses and now she can't contribute.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things but there should be some give and take. However, when they moved in together, she couldn't pay her share of the rent. The author then decided to kick her out and pay the full rent himself. The girlfriend claims it was a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation, like an accident. The author is questioning if he overreacted.\n\nNow, the key points here are financial responsibility in a relationship and mutual contribution. When two people move in together, it's generally expected that they split costs, unless they have a different agreement. The author states that she was supposed to pay rent but couldn't, leading to him covering the full amount, which is causing him financial strain.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. In many relationships, especially cohabitating ones, sharing financial responsibilities is standard. If one person is consistently not contributing, it can lead to conflict. The author decided to end the relationship and the living arrangement, which could be seen as a consequence of her inability to meet her financial obligations. However, kicking someone out of a shared living space might be seen as extreme, depending on the circumstances.\n\nThe girlfriend's argument that she was testing his reaction in a hypothetical emergency situation is a bit odd. The author seems to think it's a different scenario, which is a valid point. Emergencies are unpredictable and require support, but not paying rent intentionally isn't the same as an unforeseen accident. So the author might have a point there.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled it differently, like setting clearer boundaries or financial agreements from the start. However, given that she wasn't contributing and the situation was causing him financial harm, his decision to end the living arrangement might be justified. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's taking responsibility for his own financial well-being and setting a boundary when expectations weren't met. The girlfriend's actions led to the situation, so the author's response, while possibly harsh, is a result of her not fulfilling her part of the agreement. Therefore, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
