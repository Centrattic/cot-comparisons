Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. Let's look at the details.\n\nThe author mentions that from the start, they took on most financial responsibilities, like dinners, events, trips, and groceries. The girlfriend paid occasionally and helped with cleaning. The author believed in the guy paying most but wanted some give and take. When they moved in together, the rent was split initially, but the girlfriend stopped contributing due to her debts. The author paid the full rent, which strained their finances. Now, the girlfriend can't pay again, and the author kicks her out, saying they can't support her financially anymore. The girlfriend claims this was a test for how the author would react in a tough situation.\n\nSo, the key points here are financial responsibility and the expectations in a relationship. The author set boundaries when the girlfriend couldn't meet her part of the financial agreement. They tried to reach a compromise, but the girlfriend's inability to contribute led to a breaking point. The girlfriend's test argument seems flimsy because real emergencies would require mutual support, but this seems more like a pattern of dependency without reciprocity. The author's decision to end the relationship seems reasonable given the lack of mutual financial support. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
