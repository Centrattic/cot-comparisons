Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for breaking up and asking his girlfriend to leave because she couldn't pay rent. The question is between options A (yes) and B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation from both sides. The author mentions that they were in a relationship where he paid for most things, and she cleaned occasionally. When they moved in together, she couldn't pay her share of the rent. He ended up paying all the rent, which caused him financial stress. When she couldn't pay again, he kicked her out.\n\nThe girlfriend's reasoning seems to be that because she's in debt, he should take care of her, and the situation was a test. The author feels that it's unfair to bear all financial responsibility, especially when his own financial situation is strained. \n\nNow, considering societal norms, relationships often involve shared responsibilities. If both partners are expected to contribute, and one can't, that can lead to conflict. The author tried to split the rent initially but the girlfriend couldn't pay. He may have been under the impression that she would contribute, but she didn't. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's standing up for his own financial stability. If a partner can't meet their responsibilities, it's reasonable to reassess the living arrangement. The girlfriend's behavior\u2014leaving for a week and not addressing her share\u2014might be seen as irresponsible. The author's decision to end the cohabitation to manage his finances could be justified. \n\nBut some might argue that relationships require support during tough times. However, the girlfriend's approach of not contributing and treating it as a test might be the real issue. The author isn't refusing to help entirely\u2014he paid the rent\u2014but he can't bear the full burden when it affects his own obligations.\n\nSo, based on this, the author isn't in the wrong. He's making a decision to protect his own financial health, which is a valid concern. The girlfriend's lack of contribution and her justification as a test seem to be her own issues. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
