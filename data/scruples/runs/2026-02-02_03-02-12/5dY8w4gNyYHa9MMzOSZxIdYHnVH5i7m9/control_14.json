Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a breakup because the girlfriend couldn't pay rent. The author says he believed the guy should pay for most things but there should be some give and take. When they moved in together, they split the rent at first, but then the girlfriend couldn't pay her share due to her own financial issues. The author ended up paying everything, which put him in a tough spot financially. He got angry and kicked her out after she couldn't pay again and claimed that being in a relationship means he should support her financially without her helping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in a relationship regarding shared expenses. The author mentions that he thought it's okay for the guy to pay for most things, but there should be some balance. When they moved in together, splitting the rent is common, so the girlfriend not contributing might have been a problem. The author did pay for a lot before, but when it came to shared living expenses, her inability to pay led to conflict. \n\nThe girlfriend's argument is that the boyfriend should handle everything because she had her own debts. But if they're living together, expecting one person to cover all costs while the other has debts might be unfair. The author's side is that he's helping her out, but his own financial situation is suffering. He had to choose between his bills and hers, which led to him feeling overwhelmed.\n\nThe key points here are mutual responsibility and communication. The girlfriend might have expected the author to take on all financial responsibilities as part of the relationship, but the author had his limits. When she couldn't pay and didn't reciprocate, the author decided to end the relationship. The girlfriend's statement about testing his reaction in a crisis might indicate she didn't realize how her actions affected him. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, relationships usually require compromise. If the author had financial expectations from the start and communicated them, then expecting her to contribute makes sense. However, if the girlfriend was in a vulnerable financial position and couldn't meet her part, maybe the author could have approached it differently. But given that he tried to work with her and she didn't contribute at all, leading to his financial strain, his decision might be justified. \n\nOn the other hand, kicking someone out of the apartment over unpaid rent could be seen as harsh if there were no prior agreements or if there was a pattern of one-sided support. The author might be in the right if they had an agreement to split costs and she violated it. But if they didn't set clear boundaries from the start, maybe he's also at fault for not addressing it earlier. \n\nConsidering all that, the author made a tough decision to protect his own financial stability after repeated issues. The girlfriend's lack of reciprocity and communication probably played a role. So, the answer might be B (author not in the wrong) because he's standing up for his own needs after she didn't meet her responsibilities. But I need to check if there's any aspect where he could have handled it better without breaking up. Maybe he could have set clearer expectations earlier or sought a solution together. However, given the situation described, his actions seem like a last resort after her repeated failures to contribute. So leaning towards B.\n"
