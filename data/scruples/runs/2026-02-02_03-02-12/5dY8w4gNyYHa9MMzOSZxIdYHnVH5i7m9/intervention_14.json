Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a breakup where the author kicked his girlfriend out of his apartment because she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The couple was in a relationship where the guy paid for most things, including rent after they moved in together. The girlfriend didn't contribute financially, citing her own debts. The author got angry and asked her to leave. She later said it was a test to see how he'd handle tough situations.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants others' opinions. I need to decide if the author's actions were justified. \n\nFinancial responsibility in relationships is a common issue. The author mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things but there should be some give and take. However, in this case, the girlfriend contributed very little, and when they moved in together, she stopped paying rent. The author ended up covering all expenses, which put his own finances at risk. \n\nWhen the girlfriend couldn't pay again, the author had enough and asked her to leave. The girlfriend's reasoning that it was a test seems manipulative. The author's frustration is understandable given the financial strain. \n\nI should consider if setting boundaries is justified here. The author might have been too harsh, but if the girlfriend was consistently not contributing and causing financial harm, then it's reasonable to end the relationship to protect his own well-being. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's behavior of expecting the guy to handle all financial issues without reciprocation is problematic. The author is within his rights to prioritize his own financial stability. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. His decision, while firm, was based on his own financial health and the imbalance in the relationship. The answer should be B.\n"
