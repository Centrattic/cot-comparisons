Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup because the girlfriend couldn't pay rent.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The author mentions that he paid for most things in the relationship, even moving in together. The girlfriend wasn't contributing equally, especially with rent. When they moved in together, she couldn't pay her share due to her own debts. The author had to cover the rent, which put him in a financial bind. The final straw was when she refused to pay anything and even said \"why do I have a boyfriend then?\" when confronted. The author then kicked her out, and she later claimed it was a test.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. Relationships typically require mutual support, but that shouldn't mean one person is expected to cover everything indefinitely. The author tried splitting rent at first, but the girlfriend couldn't contribute. Financial responsibility is a big part of a relationship, especially when living together. If one person is consistently not pulling their weight financially, it's understandable for the other to set boundaries. The girlfriend's attitude of expecting the partner to handle all financial burdens without reciprocity is problematic. The author's reaction, while harsh, might be a result of frustration and needing to prioritize his own financial stability.\n\nBut then, is kicking her out the right move? Maybe there were other solutions, like moving out or renegotiating the living arrangement. However, the girlfriend's refusal to contribute, even when asked to pay back, shows a lack of consideration. The author's main issue was the imbalance in financial responsibility. The girlfriend's test scenario is questionable because real emergencies are different from ongoing financial neglect. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He had a right to expect some level of contribution, especially after the initial agreement to split rent. His actions were a response to her not meeting her responsibilities. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
