Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a breakup where he kicked his girlfriend out of his apartment because she couldn't pay rent. Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the user mentions that the girlfriend was in the mindset that the guy should pay for everything. He agreed to pay for most things like dinners, events, trips, and groceries, but she only paid occasionally and cleaned sometimes. He thought there should be some give and take, not all on him.\n\nThen she moved in with him in June 2018 and for six months didn't pay rent, bills, or groceries. She did clean a bit, but it wasn't equal. When they moved in together, they split the rent for a couple of months. But then she couldn't pay, so he covered it, which put him in a financial bind. She later said she couldn't pay again, and he asked her to repay him, but she responded that she didn't need to because she had a boyfriend. He took her to a friend's place and she left. Now she's saying she can't pay at all again, and he's furious, leading to the breakup.\n\nShe later claimed it was a test to see how he'd handle tough situations, like an accident. The user wonders if he overreacted.\n\nHmm. So, the main issue is financial responsibility in a relationship. The user paid the rent when she couldn't, but when he asked for help, she refused. He broke up with her. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom a financial standpoint, living together usually requires splitting expenses. If she's not contributing, that's a problem. He mentions he believed the guy should pay for most things but expects some reciprocity. She didn't pay her share, leading to his financial strain. When he asked her to pay back, she dismissed it, implying that as a boyfriend, he should just cover it. That's a red flag for him. He's in a tough spot financially, and her not helping is exacerbating his issues.\n\nThe girlfriend's reasoning that it was a test seems to shift blame. Testing someone's ability to handle a crisis by not contributing financially is a bit manipulative. Also, if she's in debt, maybe she should have been upfront earlier to find a solution together. Instead, she waited until it caused a problem.\n\nThe user's decision to end the relationship after she refused to contribute seems justified. He's responsible for his own financial stability and can't afford to cover her expenses indefinitely. Expecting a partner to cover all costs without any reciprocity is unfair. The girlfriend's mindset that the guy should pay for everything, even when it's a shared living situation, is problematic.\n\nSo, the user acted to protect his own financial well-being. He set a boundary when she crossed it by not contributing. Therefore, he's not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
