Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong after breaking up with his girlfriend because she couldn't pay rent. The situation is that the guy ended up paying most of the expenses when they were dating, and then after moving in together, she couldn't pay her share of the rent. He kicked her out because she wasn't contributing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The guy mentioned that he believed the guy should pay for most things, but there should be some give and take. However, when they moved in together, they agreed to split the rent, but she couldn't pay. He had to pay the full amount, which put him in a tough spot financially. He tried to ask her to pay back, but she didn't, and when he confronted her, she said he should support her because he's her boyfriend. He then kicked her out.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From a relationship perspective, financial responsibilities are a big part of any partnership. If both people are supposed to contribute, especially when living together, it's reasonable for both to share the costs. The girlfriend's inability to pay rent might be due to her own financial issues, but that doesn't necessarily mean the guy is obligated to cover everything. However, kicking someone out immediately after they can't pay rent could be seen as harsh, especially if there's a possibility of working through the problem. The girlfriend's attitude of expecting him to cover everything might be an issue, but the guy's response of immediate eviction might also be extreme. \n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but others might argue that communication and compromise could have been better approaches. The girlfriend's test of his reaction could be a red flag, but it's not clear if that's a valid reason for the breakup. The key points are mutual responsibility in a relationship, communication about financial expectations, and the immediate action taken by the author. Depending on cultural norms, some might see the guy as standing up for his boundaries, while others might think he could have handled it more compassionately. However, given the repeated failures on her part and his financial strain, his actions might be justified. So, the answer is likely B (No).\n"
