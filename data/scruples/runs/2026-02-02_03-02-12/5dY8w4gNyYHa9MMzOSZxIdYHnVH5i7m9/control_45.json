Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a breakup where the author kicked his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay the rent. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they moved in together, and she was living rent-free for a while. Then, when they started splitting the rent, she couldn't pay. The author paid the full rent, which put him in a tough financial spot. Now she's not paying anything again, and he kicks her out. She claims her debts are the reason she can't pay, and she even says it was a test to see how he'd react in a crisis.\n\nHmm. The author's side of the story is that he's been the one paying most of the expenses, and she's not contributing equally. He's frustrated because he's helping her with her debts while his own financial situation is suffering. The key points here are about financial responsibility and expectations in a relationship, especially when living together.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author chose to move in together and take on the financial burden. Maybe he should have set clearer boundaries or discussed money more openly. On the other hand, the girlfriend isn't contributing her share and is using the situation to avoid paying her part. The author might feel that he can't sustain the relationship if it's one-sided financially. \n\nThe girlfriend's argument that it's a test of how he handles emergencies seems a bit manipulative. But maybe she's in real financial trouble. The author's actions could be seen as self-preservation. However, kicking someone out of a shared home is a big step. Did he have a prior agreement about splitting bills? If they didn't have a clear agreement, then maybe the author is within his rights to ask her to leave if she's not contributing. But if they were a couple and he expected mutual support, her not paying rent might be a breach of that understanding. \n\nAlso, legal considerations come into play. If it's her apartment or a joint lease, the rules might be different. But from the description, it seems like it's his apartment, so he might have the right to ask her to leave. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, relationships should involve mutual support, but there's a balance. The author might have overstepped if he didn't address the financial issues earlier. But given the context of her not paying rent after they agreed to split it, his frustration is understandable. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He's holding her accountable for financial responsibilities, which is reasonable. However, the way he handled it\u2014kicking her out immediately after a disagreement\u2014might be seen as harsh, but considering the financial strain, it's a valid reaction. The girlfriend's lack of contribution and her testing claim don't help her case. \n\nOverall, I think the author isn't in the wrong here. He's taking a stand for his own financial stability, which is necessary. So the answer is B, No.\n"
