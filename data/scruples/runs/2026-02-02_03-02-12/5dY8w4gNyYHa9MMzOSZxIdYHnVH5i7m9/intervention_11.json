Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. They provided a detailed scenario where the author broke up with his girlfriend after she couldn't pay rent. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The main points are about financial responsibility in a relationship. The author mentions that he paid for most things initially, including rent after she moved in. The girlfriend didn't contribute financially, even after moving in together. When the author asks her to split the rent, she can't pay, leading to him covering the full rent. Eventually, he kicks her out because she refuses to contribute.\n\nFinancial responsibility is a big part of any relationship, especially when cohabiting. It's generally expected that both partners contribute to shared expenses. The author's frustration stems from the imbalance. The girlfriend's attitude that the guy should pay for everything, even when they move in together, might be a red flag. However, the author had been accommodating up to a point, which might suggest he didn't set clear boundaries early on.\n\nThe girlfriend's statement that the author should support her because she has \"a boyfriend\" is problematic. It implies an expectation of financial support without mutual contribution. The author's decision to end the relationship after repeated failures in financial cooperation seems justified. The girlfriend's claim that she was testing his reaction in a tough situation (like an accident) is a bit of a stretch because financial irresponsibility isn't the same as an emergency. \n\nHowever, I should consider if the author could have handled the situation differently. For example, setting clear financial expectations earlier or discussing the living arrangement terms upfront. But the girlfriend's actions of not contributing and expecting the author to cover everything without reciprocation do show a lack of responsibility. The author's actions were a response to ongoing issues, not a spur-of-the-moment decision. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because the girlfriend's financial behavior was unsustainable and unfair. The author had the right to set boundaries and end the relationship when those boundaries weren't respected. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
