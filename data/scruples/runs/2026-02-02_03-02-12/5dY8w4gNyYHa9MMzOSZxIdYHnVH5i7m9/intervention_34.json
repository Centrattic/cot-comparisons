Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup where the author kicked his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. The key points here are about financial responsibility in a relationship and whether the author's actions were justified.\n\nFirst, the couple started dating in 2018, and from the beginning, the author was the one covering most expenses, including rent, groceries, etc., even though the girlfriend occasionally paid for something. When they moved in together, they initially split the rent but the girlfriend stopped contributing after a few months due to her debts. The author ends up paying full rent, which causes financial strain for him. When he confronts her, she responds with an attitude that implies he should just support her, leading to the breakup.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's helping her financially while his own situation deteriorates. He feels it's unfair that she's not contributing. The girlfriend's response suggests she expected him to take care of everything, which the author finds unreasonable. The author then kicks her out, and the girlfriend claims it was a test to see how he'd react in a crisis.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. The main factors are financial expectations in a relationship. In many relationships, partners expect some level of shared responsibility, especially when living together. However, this depends on mutual agreement. Here, the girlfriend's initial mindset was that the guy should pay everything, but when they moved in together, it was implied they'd split rent. The girlfriend's failure to contribute despite this agreement could be seen as a breach of trust or partnership. The author, on his part, may have gone into the relationship with the wrong expectations if he believed she should pay her share but didn't communicate that clearly.\n\nHowever, the author did try to split rent initially, and the girlfriend's refusal to contribute after a few months, despite her debts, is a problem. The fact that she claims it was a test adds another layer, which might indicate manipulative behavior. The author's reaction of kicking her out after she refuses to help with rent could be seen as standing up for his own financial stability, especially if he was already struggling.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author should have addressed the issue earlier rather than letting it escalate. Also, in relationships, supporting each other through tough times is expected, but there are limits. The author's financial situation was compromised, which he had a right to address. The girlfriend's attitude of expecting the partner to cover all expenses without reciprocation could be the root of the problem.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were a response to the girlfriend's repeated failure to contribute financially, despite initial agreements. The girlfriend's behavior, including the test comment, suggests a lack of responsibility. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing his own financial well-being after being taken advantage of.\n"
