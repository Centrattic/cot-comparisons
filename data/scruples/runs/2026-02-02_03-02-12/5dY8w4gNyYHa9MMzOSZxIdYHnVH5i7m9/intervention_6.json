Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author and his girlfriend moved in together. Initially, they split the rent, but then she couldn't pay her share due to her own debts. He paid the full rent, which put him in a tough financial spot. Now, she's not paying anything again and when he asks her to pay back or contribute, she says, \"Why do I have a boyfriend then?\" The author then kicks her out because he's frustrated with the financial imbalance.\n\nFirst, I should consider the expectations in a relationship regarding financial responsibilities. The author mentions that he believes the guy should pay for most things but there should be some give and take. That's his personal view, but in a shared living situation, splitting costs equally is a common arrangement. However, if the girlfriend can't pay her share, that's a problem. \n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility and communication. The author paid for everything, including rent and other expenses, and the girlfriend's financial situation seems to be causing issues. When she can't pay, he's left with the burden. The girlfriend's attitude of expecting the boyfriend to cover everything might be problematic. \n\nThe author's reaction was to end the relationship and kick her out because he couldn't handle the financial strain. The girlfriend's justification that it was a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation seems like a cop-out. Testing someone's financial responsibility by not contributing when you can't isn't a valid reason to expect them to pay everything. \n\nI think the author's main issue is about fairness and mutual responsibility. If someone can't contribute their share, especially in a shared living arrangement, it creates a one-sided relationship. The author was clear about his financial limits and made a decision to end the relationship. His actions, while harsh, might be seen as necessary due to the financial pressure.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have communicated better earlier. Instead of waiting until she couldn't pay, perhaps setting clear expectations from the start would have helped. But given the timeline, the author did mention that they split the rent for a couple of months before she couldn't pay. It's unclear if there was prior discussion about financial expectations when they moved in together.\n\nThe girlfriend's test excuse is a bit of a stretch. If she was genuinely in a financial bind and couldn't pay, that's one thing, but treating it as a test implies she might have anticipated this scenario and used it as a way to see if he'd support her, which isn't healthy. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's actions seem justified. He's taking responsibility for his own financial limits and choosing to end the relationship when those limits are exceeded. The girlfriend's behavior of expecting him to cover everything without reciprocation is the root issue here. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
