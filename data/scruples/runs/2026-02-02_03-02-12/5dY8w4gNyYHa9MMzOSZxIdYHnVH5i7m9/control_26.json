Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup because the girlfriend couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author mentions that from the start, the girlfriend expected him to pay for most things, including rent when they moved in together. She contributed occasionally but not equally. When they moved in together, she stopped paying rent after a while, citing her own debts. The author ends up paying full rent, which strains his finances. The girlfriend's reasoning for not paying was that she has her own bills and debts, and she even called it a test to see how he'd handle tough situations.\n\nNow, considering relationship norms. Financial responsibility is a big part of any partnership. If both parties are supposed to contribute to shared expenses, especially when living together, it's reasonable to expect some split. The author tried to split the rent initially but then the girlfriend stopped paying. Her not contributing creates an imbalance. \n\nThe author's actions\u2014kicking her out after she refuses to pay\u2014might seem harsh, but the context is important. The girlfriend's behavior was consistent: not paying her share, and treating the situation as a test. The author felt it was unfair to bear all financial responsibilities alone. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he set a boundary when she couldn't pay. Relationships require mutual effort, and if one person isn't contributing, especially financially, it's a valid reason to reassess the relationship. However, maybe there's nuance. The girlfriend's debts might be real, but that doesn't negate the need for her to contribute. The author's reaction was to end the relationship, which is a personal choice. \n\nOn the other hand, could he have handled it differently? Maybe tried to create a clearer agreement beforehand. But given the situation, he's protecting his own financial stability. The girlfriend's test rationale is problematic because real emergencies are different from ongoing financial irresponsibility. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. He stood up for himself when his partner wasn't meeting her financial obligations. Answer B.\n"
