Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves breaking up and kicking the girlfriend out of his apartment because she couldn't pay the rent.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The guy and his girlfriend moved in together, and they initially split the rent. But then she couldn't pay her share, and he ended up covering it. Now, she's saying she can't pay again, and he kicked her out. The key points are about financial responsibility, expectations in a relationship, and whether his actions are justified.\n\nThe author mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things, but there should be some give and take. However, once they moved in together, splitting the rent is a common arrangement. She contributed in other ways like cleaning, but he felt it wasn't equal. When she couldn't pay rent, he covered it but is now facing financial strain. He kicked her out after she refused to pay, and she claims she was testing his reaction.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, expecting a partner to contribute to shared living expenses is reasonable. If she agreed to split the rent when they moved in, then not paying her share is a breach of that agreement. The author is covering her portion, which is causing him financial stress. His decision to ask her to leave because she's not contributing seems justified, especially since he's made it clear that he can't take care of the rent alone. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe he could have handled the situation more amicably, like discussing the issue earlier or finding another solution. But the main question is whether he's in the wrong. Since she agreed to the arrangement and then failed to uphold her part, his actions are understandable. Also, she admitted it was a test, which might indicate manipulative behavior. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
