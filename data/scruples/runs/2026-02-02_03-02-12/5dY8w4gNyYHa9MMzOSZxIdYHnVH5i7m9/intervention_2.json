Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they were in a relationship where they paid for most things, and the girlfriend would occasionally contribute. When they moved in together, they split rent initially, but the girlfriend couldn't pay her share due to her debts. The author ended up paying the full rent, which caused them financial strain. When the girlfriend couldn't pay again, the author kicked her out. She later claimed it was a test to see how he'd react in tough times.\n\nNow, considering the situation, the key points are financial responsibility in a relationship. The author might feel they've been carrying the financial burden unfairly. Relationships usually require mutual support, but there's a balance. The girlfriend's inability to contribute could be due to her personal financial issues, but expecting the partner to cover everything without any reciprocity isn't sustainable. The author decided to set a boundary by asking her to leave when she couldn't contribute, which might be seen as necessary for their own financial stability.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The girlfriend might have had valid financial hardships, but the author's reaction was abrupt. Ending the relationship over unpaid rent, while understandable, could be seen as harsh if there was a lack of prior communication about financial expectations. Relationships involve compromise, and maybe a more collaborative approach could have been taken, like discussing budgeting or other ways to manage the rent together despite her debts.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author did try to communicate and set boundaries. When the girlfriend failed to meet her end, the author made a decision to protect their own financial health. It's a tough call, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong if they had made clear expectations and the girlfriend repeatedly failed to meet them. Relationships require both parties to contribute, and if that's not happening, it's reasonable to step back.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they set boundaries after the girlfriend didn't meet her financial responsibilities, even though it's a sensitive situation.\n"
