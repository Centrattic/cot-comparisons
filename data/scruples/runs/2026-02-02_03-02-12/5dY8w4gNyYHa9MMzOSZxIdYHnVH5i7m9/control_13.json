Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a breakup where the author kicked their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the couple moved in together, and initially, the guy was paying most of the expenses even before they were together. Then when they moved in together, they split the rent for a while. The girlfriend couldn't pay her share due to her debts, so the guy paid the full rent. The next month, she still couldn't contribute, leading to the breakup. The girlfriend claims it was a test to see how he'd handle a tough situation, like an accident.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong to break up and kick her out. Let me think about the key points. Financial responsibility in relationships is important. If both partners are supposed to contribute to shared expenses, and one is consistently unable or unwilling to do so, that can strain the relationship. The author mentions that he believed in the guy paying most but there should be some give and take. The girlfriend, however, was paying very little even before moving in together. After moving in, she couldn't pay her share, leading the author to cover everything, which put him in financial trouble.\n\nThe author's decision to end the relationship seems based on his frustration with the financial imbalance. The girlfriend's reasoning that it was a test doesn't justify her not contributing. Financial responsibility is a mutual responsibility in a shared living arrangement. The author's action might be seen as self-preservation, ensuring his own financial stability. However, kicking someone out suddenly could be harsh, but the context of ongoing issues might justify it.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have tried to communicate better or set clearer boundaries earlier. But the situation escalated over time, and the final breaking point was her inability to contribute despite his financial strain. The girlfriend's attitude of expecting the guy to handle everything might be the root issue. So, the author isn't necessarily wrong for ending it due to financial disagreements that weren't resolved.\n"
