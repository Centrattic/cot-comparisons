Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and his girlfriend moved in together. Initially, they split the rent, but she stopped paying her share, citing her own debts. He ended up paying the full rent, which put a strain on his finances. When he confronted her, she gave a response that he found unacceptable, leading him to kick her out. She later said it was a test to see how he'd handle it, but the author disagrees.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider some points. Financial responsibilities in a relationship can be a touchy subject. The author mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things but expects some give and take. When they moved in together, splitting the rent was the norm. However, the girlfriend didn't contribute, which the author found unfair. \n\nThe key here is mutual agreement on financial responsibilities. If the couple agreed to split the rent when moving in, then it's reasonable for the author to expect that. If the girlfriend couldn't meet her part of the agreement, the author had the right to address it. The author's decision to end the relationship and ask her to leave might be seen as his way of enforcing the agreement, especially since her actions caused him financial stress.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should have communicated better before taking such drastic actions. Kicking someone out of the apartment can be harsh, but if the person isn't contributing financially and there's no resolution, it's a practical solution. Also, the girlfriend's attitude of expecting the partner to cover everything without reciprocity is problematic.\n\nThe girlfriend's test explanation is a red flag. Using a crisis as a test shows a lack of consideration for the partner's financial stability. The author's reaction to her lack of contribution and her justification is understandable. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong because he's standing up for fair treatment in a financial agreement. The girlfriend's actions were the root issue here. The author's decision to end the relationship under these circumstances is a reasonable response to an unfair situation.\n"
