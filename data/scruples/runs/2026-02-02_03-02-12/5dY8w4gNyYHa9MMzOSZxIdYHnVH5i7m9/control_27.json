Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out of their apartment because she couldn't pay rent. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple moved in together, they agreed to split rent, but the girlfriend couldn't pay her share due to her own debts. The author paid the full rent, then the girlfriend again couldn't contribute, leading to the author asking her to leave.\n\nSo, the key points here are financial responsibility in a relationship. The author mentions that they believed the guy should pay for most things but there should be give and take. However, the girlfriend wasn't contributing equally in terms of rent and other expenses. When they moved in together, splitting rent was part of the agreement, but she couldn't hold up her end. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong to kick her out. Legally, if the girlfriend had a lease as a co-tenant, the author might not have the right to evict her. But if she was a guest or not on the lease, maybe he could ask her to leave. However, the moral aspect is more about fairness in the relationship. The author was taking care of the rent, which is a significant financial burden, and the girlfriend wasn't contributing. The author felt it was unfair and that their own financial stability was at risk. \n\nThe girlfriend's reasoning that the guy should pay for everything seems to have been a problem from the start. The fact that she moved into the apartment rent-free for six months and then continued to not contribute might have built up the author's frustration. The final straw was her inability to pay rent again without any effort to reciprocate. \n\nThe girlfriend's test explanation\u2014that she wanted to see how the author would react in a tough situation\u2014doesn't seem valid because the situation isn't equivalent to an accident. The author is dealing with financial strain, and the girlfriend's lack of responsibility is causing more stress. \n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, communication is key. The author tried to communicate and set boundaries but the girlfriend didn't respond. The author's decision to end the relationship might be seen as a way to protect their own financial well-being. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong because they tried to work things out, and when it became unsustainable, they made a tough decision to end the relationship. The girlfriend's actions (not paying rent, expecting the author to cover everything) contributed to the situation. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
