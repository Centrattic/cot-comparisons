Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that their girlfriend moved in with them and didn't pay rent for six months. That seems like a significant issue. Even if they were in a relationship, splitting expenses is usually expected when two people live together. The fact that she didn't pay rent for that long could be a problem, especially if the author is struggling financially.\n\nThen, when they moved in together, they initially split the rent. But then the girlfriend couldn't pay her share due to her debts. The author paid the full rent, which put them in a difficult financial situation. The girlfriend didn't follow up on paying back or contributing later, and even said she couldn't pay anything again. The author got frustrated and asked her to leave. She later claimed it was a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation, which the author disagrees with.\n\nSo, the key points are: the girlfriend didn't contribute financially as expected, the author was in a tough spot, and the breakup happened because of financial disagreements. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom a financial responsibility standpoint, if both people live in a shared space, it's reasonable to expect shared costs. If one person consistently refuses to contribute, it can create a financial imbalance. The author made a decision to end the relationship under these circumstances. However, kicking someone out of an apartment might have legal implications, especially if they're a tenant. But the question is more about moral or social wrongness rather than legal.\n\nThe author might be justified if the financial strain was significant and the girlfriend wasn't willing to meet the agreed-upon responsibilities. On the other hand, if the author didn't address the issue earlier or set clear boundaries, maybe they share some responsibility. The girlfriend's attitude of expecting the guy to pay everything could be problematic, but that doesn't necessarily make the author right in the way they handled the breakup.\n\nThe girlfriend's test explanation seems like an excuse, which the author rightly dismisses. The author's frustration is understandable given the financial stress. However, evicting someone without proper process (if they're a legal tenant) could be an issue, but the question is about being in the wrong morally. \n\nConsidering all this, it seems like the author made a tough decision based on financial stress and broken agreements. While maybe not perfect in handling it, the core issue was the girlfriend's unwillingness to contribute, so the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
