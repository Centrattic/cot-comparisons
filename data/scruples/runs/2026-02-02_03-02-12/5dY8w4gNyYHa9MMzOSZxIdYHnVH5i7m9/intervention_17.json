Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up and asking his girlfriend to leave because she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The couple moved in together, and initially, the man paid for most things, including rent. The girlfriend moved into his apartment for six months without paying rent or bills, contributing minimally. Then, when they moved in together, she couldn't pay her share. The final straw was her inability to pay again, leading him to ask her to leave.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility and trust. The man expected some balance in expenses, which he didn't get. The girlfriend seems to have a mindset that the guy should always cover costs, which led to his financial strain. Breaking up over this could be seen as a decision to protect his own well-being, especially since their financial expectations were incompatible.\n\nBut maybe there's a nuance. Did he communicate his expectations clearly before moving in together? If he didn't set boundaries, perhaps he shares some responsibility. However, the girlfriend's approach of treating it as a \"test\" might be manipulative, testing his commitment without being honest. \n\nFinancial compatibility is crucial in relationships. If both parties can't meet their financial obligations, it's a problem. The man prioritized his own financial stability, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's lack of accountability and her testing behavior could justify his decision. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He acted to resolve an unsustainable situation.\n"
