Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo the author had a girlfriend who moved into his apartment. They were splitting rent initially, but she stopped paying her share because of her own debts. He ends up paying all the rent, which puts him in a tough financial spot. When he confronts her, she says that's why she has a boyfriend. He then kicks her out, and later she claims it was a test to see his reaction.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author is clearly frustrated about financial responsibility. Paying for everything, including groceries and rent, and then being expected to cover all costs alone. It's a valid concern because shared expenses in a relationship should be discussed and agreed upon. On the other hand, the girlfriend might have had financial issues beyond her control, but she didn't communicate effectively. The fact that she considered it a test is problematic. Testing someone's reaction in a serious financial situation isn't healthy.\n\nThe author's actions\u2014breaking up and asking her to leave\u2014might seem harsh, but he's standing up for himself financially. It's important to have boundaries in relationships. If both parties aren't contributing as agreed, it's reasonable to reassess the situation. The girlfriend's attitude seems to be expecting the partner to cover costs without reciprocation, which isn't fair. The author tried to work with her, but she wasn't meeting her end of the deal. \n\nAlso, the part where she says \"why do I have a boyfriend then?\" is a red flag. That mentality suggests she expects the partner to take on more than their share without accountability. The author's decision to end the relationship to protect his finances might be tough, but it's his right to prioritize his own financial stability. \n\nI should also consider cultural norms. The author mentions he believes the guy should pay for most things but expects some give and take. The girlfriend wasn't pulling her weight, so the author's actions are a response to her not meeting the mutual expectations. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's method of kicking her out might be seen as abrupt, his stance on financial responsibility is justified. The girlfriend's lack of contribution and the testing behavior are significant issues. So, the answer would likely be that he's not in the wrong.\n"
