Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their girlfriend for not paying rent is in the wrong. The situation is that the woman moved in and wasn't contributing equally to the rent and other expenses. The author feels like they've been supporting her financially and it's become a burden.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key points. The author mentions that the girlfriend expected the guy to pay for everything, which he did against his better judgment. They moved in together, split rent initially, but she stopped paying due to her own debts. The author paid full rent, leading to financial strain. When asked to contribute, she refused, leading to the breakup.\n\nNow, considering societal norms around relationships and finances. In many relationships, both partners contribute to shared expenses, but the expectation can vary. The author expected some give and take but felt it wasn't balanced. The girlfriend's argument that the guy should pay for most things but still expects some help. However, when it comes to splitting rent, both typically contribute. \n\nThe breaking point was the repeated refusal to pay her share, causing financial hardship. The author's reaction was to kick her out, which might be seen as a last resort after multiple issues. The girlfriend's statement about using the situation as a test seems dismissive of the author's financial struggles.\n\nLegally, if it's a shared lease, both might be responsible for full rent regardless of living there. But the author here is ending the relationship and the living arrangement. Emotionally, the author felt wronged, and the girlfriend's actions were irresponsible. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's actions are a response to financial exploitation. While relationships can involve support, it's reasonable to expect mutual contribution, especially in shared living costs. The girlfriend's behavior was not considerate of the author's financial health. The author's decision, while harsh, was a reaction to ongoing irresponsibility. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
