Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. First, I need to consider the situation from both sides.\n\nThe author mentions that they were in a relationship where he paid for most things, and she helped sometimes. Then when they moved in together, she stopped paying rent. He paid full rent, got into financial trouble, and after she couldn't pay again, he kicked her out. She claims it was a test to see his reaction.\n\nHmm, in a relationship, especially a cohabitating one, splitting expenses is usually expected. If the girlfriend can't contribute, that's a problem. The author tried to split the rent initially, but she couldn't pay. He had to cover it, which caused him financial strain. Then she couldn't pay again, and he decided she needs to leave. \n\nBut wait, is it fair to kick someone out of your apartment just because they can't pay? Maybe there was communication issues. The girlfriend might be in a tough financial spot herself. However, the author was also in a position where he couldn't afford to pay the full rent alone. \n\nThe key points here are responsibility and communication. The author might have expected her to contribute, which is reasonable. If she couldn't pay, maybe they should have discussed other ways to manage the expenses. But when she didn't take responsibility and kept refusing to pay even after promises, the author's decision to end the relationship and ask her to leave could be seen as justified. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's comment about it being a test seems dismissive of the author's financial struggles. That's a red flag. The author might have overreacted, but given the circumstances of financial strain and lack of reciprocity, it's understandable. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Probably not. He had a right to expect some financial contribution from his partner when living together. Her not paying and his resulting actions are about responsibility. Answer B.\n"
