Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this post is in the wrong for breaking up and asking his girlfriend to leave because she couldn't pay rent. The situation started with the girlfriend expecting the guy to pay for everything, even though he sometimes contributed. Then they moved in together, but she wasn't paying her share. Now she's saying she can't pay rent again, and he kicked her out. The main issue here is financial responsibility in a relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around splitting rent in a shared living situation. Typically, when two people move in together, especially in a relationship, it's expected that they split the costs, unless there's some agreement otherwise. The author mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things but there should be some give and take. The girlfriend seems to have relied heavily on him financially, which might have been an issue from the start.\n\nThen, when they moved in together, they split the rent for a couple of months. That's a good sign because it shows some initial agreement. But the problem arises when she can't pay again. The author is in a precarious financial position because he's had to cover her share twice. The key here is whether the girlfriend's inability to pay is a one-time issue or a recurring problem. The fact that she couldn't pay in February and then again now suggests it's a pattern. The author is clearly frustrated because he's shouldering all the financial burden, which might not be sustainable.\n\nThe girlfriend's argument is that she expected the boyfriend to handle her financial issues, implying that the role of the boyfriend is to support her financially. However, that's not a realistic or fair expectation in a relationship. Financial support should be mutual and based on shared responsibilities, not one-sided. The author is right to feel that if she can't contribute when possible, the relationship isn't balanced. \n\nAlso, she mentions that her not paying rent was a test to see how he'd react in tough situations. That's a pretty manipulative and disrespectful approach. Using someone's financial stress as a test to see if they'll support you in an emergency is not a sign of a healthy relationship. The author's reaction of being angry and asking her to leave seems justified, especially since it's affecting his ability to manage his own debts and bills.\n\nAnother point is the author's financial situation. He had to use his own money to cover the rent, which put him in a bad spot. If he had to cover her rent twice, that's a significant strain. Relationships require compromise, and if one person is consistently relying on the other without reciprocation, it's a problem. The girlfriend's lack of response to the repayment request also shows a lack of accountability.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the lease. If they are both on the lease, he might be legally obligated to pay the full rent regardless of her contribution. However, the question is about being in the wrong morally or in the relationship, not legally. So even if he had to pay, it doesn't mean he's wrong to set boundaries.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he wants the relationship to be fair and that he can't keep supporting her financially without some help. Kicking her out after repeated failures to pay might be a harsh decision, but it's a personal choice to protect his own financial stability. The girlfriend's expectation that he should just handle everything without her contributing is the problematic part here.\n\nIn summary, the girlfriend's behavior is the main issue\u2014expecting the guy to cover all costs and not contributing when able. The author's actions are in response to her not meeting agreed-upon responsibilities, so I don't think he's in the wrong.\n"
