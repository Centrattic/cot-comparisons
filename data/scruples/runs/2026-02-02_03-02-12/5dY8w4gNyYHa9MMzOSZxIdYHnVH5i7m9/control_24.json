Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author and his girlfriend moved in together. Initially, they split rent, but she couldn't pay after a while. He paid the rent himself, which put him in a tough financial spot. Then, she couldn't pay again and justified it by saying \"why do I have a boyfriend?\" The author then kicked her out. She claims it was a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation, like an accident.\n\nHmm. So, from the author's perspective, he's taken on all the financial responsibility, which is unsustainable. He's had to cover her rent and other bills, leading to his own financial stress. When she can't pay and even implies that her role is to be supported, he decides to end it. \n\nBut wait, the girlfriend's reasoning is that she's in a relationship where the guy is supposed to pay for things. She moved in and didn't contribute, then when confronted, she said she couldn't pay because of her debts. The author might feel that it's unfair for him to bear all the financial burden, especially when they're supposed to be partners. \n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility in a relationship. There's no legal obligation for partners to support each other financially unless there's a marriage or some legal agreement. So, if the couple is cohabiting but not legally obligated, the expectation is usually that both contribute. The author is taking the stance that he's doing his part, but she's not. The girlfriend, on the other hand, seems to expect support without contributing equally. \n\nThe author's actions of breaking up and kicking her out might be seen as a way to enforce boundaries. However, some might argue that it's harsh if there's no prior agreement on financial responsibilities. But given the context, the author was already in a precarious situation, and kicking her out might be a last resort. \n\nThe girlfriend's claim about it being a test for an accident scenario is a bit iffy. If she was testing his response, that's manipulative. But maybe she genuinely couldn't pay. Either way, the author's frustration is valid. He can't keep supporting her financially without it affecting his own stability. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the relationship implied mutual support, but she didn't contribute, then he's not in the wrong. The problem is the imbalance. He's taking a stand for his own financial health. However, if he had agreed to support her financially without any reciprocity, he might be in the wrong. But the story shows he tried to have her pay back and she refused, which justifies his actions. \n\nI think the answer is B, No, the author is not in the wrong. He's standing up for his own financial well-being after repeated issues. The girlfriend's expectations might be unrealistic, and the author is asserting his boundaries.\n"
