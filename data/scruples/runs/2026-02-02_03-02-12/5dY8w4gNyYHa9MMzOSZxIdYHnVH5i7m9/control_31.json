Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend and kicking her out because she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The writer mentions that from the start, the girlfriend expected the guy to pay for most things, and he did, even though he felt it wasn't equal. Then they moved in together, and she stopped paying rent due to her debts. The writer paid the full rent, which put him in a tough financial spot. When she couldn't pay again, he kicked her out.\n\nSo, the main issues here are financial responsibility in a relationship and communication. The writer probably felt that since they were in a committed relationship and living together, both should contribute to shared expenses like rent. The girlfriend, on the other hand, didn't meet her financial obligations, leading to the breakup.\n\nThe writer's actions might seem harsh, but he's standing up for himself when his own financial situation is at risk. The girlfriend's behavior of testing his reaction by not paying rent is problematic. However, the writer's approach was to kick her out immediately, which might have been a strong reaction. But considering the ongoing financial strain and lack of contribution from her side, maybe it's justified.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of partners contributing to shared living costs. If they were living together, splitting rent is standard unless otherwise agreed. The girlfriend's inability to pay might be due to her financial issues, but the writer should have set clear expectations earlier. The fact that the girlfriend considered it a test of commitment complicates things, as it shows a lack of consideration for his financial health.\n\nThe writer's overreaction could be debated. However, he was in a position where he couldn't afford to keep paying full rent alone. His decision, while harsh, might be seen as necessary to protect his own financial stability. The key here is whether the writer's actions were reasonable given the circumstances. Since the girlfriend wasn't meeting her responsibilities, and the writer had communicated his concerns, his actions might not be in the wrong.\n"
