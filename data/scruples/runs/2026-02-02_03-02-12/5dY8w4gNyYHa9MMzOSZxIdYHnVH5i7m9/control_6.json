Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the right thing by breaking up with his girlfriend and evicting her because she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points from the situation. The couple moved in together, initially split the rent, but the girlfriend started not contributing due to her own financial issues. The author took full responsibility for rent, which strained his finances. When the girlfriend again couldn't pay, he kicked her out.\n\nFrom a financial responsibility perspective, splitting rent when living together is common. However, the girlfriend's inability to pay might be due to her personal circumstances. But the author mentions that even before moving in, she had a mindset where the guy pays everything, and she didn't contribute equally. This pattern continued after moving in. \n\nThe author's main issue is that he's shouldering all the financial burden, which is causing him stress. When someone can't meet their financial obligations in a shared living situation, it's understandable that the other person might feel overwhelmed. However, the method of handling it\u2014kicking her out abruptly\u2014could be seen as harsh. \n\nBut then again, the girlfriend's response when confronted was dismissive, saying \"why do I have a boyfriend then?\" which indicates a lack of responsibility. The author's decision to end the relationship might be driven by his need for fairness and financial stability. \n\nThe girlfriend's claim that it was a test is problematic. Testing a partner's reaction to financial stress is not a healthy approach. The author's reaction, while firm, might be justified given her lack of contribution and the test comment. \n\nLegally, evicting someone from an apartment can be complicated. If they were in a lease together, the author might need to follow proper eviction procedures. However, the question is more about moral wrongdoing rather than legal. \n\nEmotionally, the author had reached a breaking point. The girlfriend's behavior showed a consistent pattern of not contributing, leading to the author making a tough but necessary decision. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author's actions seem like a response to a long-term issue where his needs were unmet. While the method of breaking up could be handled more gracefully, the underlying issues with the girlfriend's financial responsibility likely played a role. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
