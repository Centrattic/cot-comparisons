Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for kicking his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author mentions that he believed it's okay for the guy to pay for most things, but there should be some balance. His girlfriend moved in, and initially, she contributed a bit by cleaning. Then, when they moved in together, she stopped paying rent after some time due to her debts. The author ended up paying the full rent, which put him in a tough financial spot. When she couldn't pay even a few hundred later, he kicked her out.\n\nHe's wondering if he overreacted, especially since she claimed it was a test to see how he'd react in a crisis. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but we need to decide between A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nLet me consider common views on relationships and financial responsibilities. In many relationships, splitting expenses is a mutual agreement. The author contributed more financially but expected some reciprocity. However, the girlfriend's inability to pay rent due to her own debts is a real issue. If she's in financial trouble, maybe the author should have been more understanding. But the key here is that she was living rent-free, which can strain any relationship. The author's frustration is understandable, especially since he's sacrificing his own financial stability.\n\nThe girlfriend's attitude of expecting the guy to handle all financial burdens without give and take seems problematic. If she couldn't contribute, maybe the relationship wasn't balanced. The author's decision to end the relationship over this could be seen as a last resort after repeated issues. On the other hand, maybe he should have communicated better or found a compromise. But given the context of her not helping at all and the financial strain, his actions might be justified.\n\nThe girlfriend's comment about it being a test adds another layer. If she was testing his commitment, that's not fair. The author might have felt manipulated. However, using financial hardship as a test is a red flag. The author's reaction could be seen as a necessary step to protect his own interests.\n\nIn summary, while there's no single right answer in relationships, the author's actions seem like a response to ongoing imbalance and financial pressure. He's prioritizing his own well-being and financial health, which is important. So the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
