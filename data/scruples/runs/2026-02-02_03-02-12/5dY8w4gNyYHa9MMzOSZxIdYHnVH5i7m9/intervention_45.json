Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nThe situation is that the author broke up with his girlfriend and asked her to leave because she couldn't pay rent. He mentions that she expected him to pay for everything from the start, and even after moving in together, she couldn't contribute. When he tried splitting the rent, she couldn't pay, and now she's not helping with her share. He ended up paying full rent, which is causing him financial strain. She even said it was a test to see how he'd react to tough situations.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in a relationship regarding shared responsibilities. The author believed in the guy paying most, but there should be some give and take. The girlfriend didn't meet her financial obligations, which is a big deal when living together. The author tried to be understanding but eventually reached a breaking point. \n\nFinancial stress in relationships is a common issue. The girlfriend's actions seem to lack accountability. If she couldn't pay rent, maybe she should have moved out instead of staying with a friend. The author's decision to end the relationship because of this might be seen as justified, especially since the financial imbalance was affecting his own stability. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's claim that it was a test complicates things. But the author's main issue is her inability to contribute, not just a test. If she wasn't willing to pay her share, the author isn't wrong to set boundaries. \n\nIn many relationships, both partners are expected to contribute to shared expenses unless there's a specific arrangement. The author tried splitting the rent and then covering her part when she couldn't pay, but it's unsustainable. The girlfriend's attitude of expecting the guy to handle everything without reciprocation is problematic. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. He tried to be supportive but had to prioritize his own financial health. The answer should be B.\n"
