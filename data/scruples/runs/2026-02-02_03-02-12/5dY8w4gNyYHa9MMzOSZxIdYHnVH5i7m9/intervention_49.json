Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. They provided a detailed scenario where the author broke up with his girlfriend after she couldn't pay rent. The key points here are about financial responsibility and expectations in a relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author and his girlfriend moved in together, and initially, she didn't pay rent because she thought the guy should cover everything. Over time, when they started splitting rent, she couldn't pay her share due to her own debts. The author ends up paying full rent, which puts him in a financial bind. When he confronts her, she responds by saying she can't pay and questions why he's helping her. He kicks her out, leading to the question of whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFinancial responsibility in relationships is a gray area. There's no one-size-fits-all answer, but generally, mutual contribution is important. The author mentions he believed the guy should pay for most things but there needs to be give and take. The girlfriend's actions\u2014moving in rent-free for six months and then not contributing when it's time to split\u2014might be seen as unfair. However, relationships also require communication and negotiation. \n\nThe author's main issue seems to be that he's shouldering all the financial burden, which can strain a relationship. When he decides to kick her out after she can't pay, it's a response to her not contributing. The girlfriend's claim that it was a test adds to the conflict. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's actions are a reaction to her not meeting her financial obligations. While it's harsh to kick someone out, especially in a romantic relationship, if both parties agreed to split costs and one can't follow through, the other might feel justified in protecting their own financial stability. The girlfriend's mindset of expecting the partner to pay everything without reciprocity may be the root issue here. \n\nHowever, it's also important to consider if there was prior agreement about splitting rent. If there wasn't a clear understanding, both could be at fault. The author's frustration is understandable, especially if he's taken on significant debt. His decision to end the relationship when she can't or won't contribute might be seen as necessary for his own well-being. \n\nOn the other hand, if there was a verbal agreement to split rent and she can't pay, maybe the author should have found another solution, like adjusting the split temporarily. But the girlfriend's attitude\u2014saying \"why do I have a boyfriend then?\"\u2014suggests a lack of consideration for his financial situation. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions stem from financial strain caused by his partner's inability or unwillingness to contribute. While breaking up and removing someone from a shared living situation is a serious step, it might be justified given the circumstances. The main issue is the lack of mutual financial responsibility. So, the author is likely not in the wrong.\n"
