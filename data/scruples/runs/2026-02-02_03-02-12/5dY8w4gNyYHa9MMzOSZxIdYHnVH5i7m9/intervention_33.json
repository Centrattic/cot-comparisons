Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author breaking up with his girlfriend and asking her to leave because she couldn't pay rent. The key points here are financial responsibility in a relationship, expectations, and the decision to end the relationship.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that from the start, he was paying for most things, including rent, dinners, trips, etc. The girlfriend occasionally paid for something and helped with cleaning, but he felt it wasn't equal. The user's main issue is with the financial arrangement when they moved in together. Initially, they split the rent, but the girlfriend couldn't pay, leading the author to cover the full rent, which put him in a tough spot financially. The girlfriend's justification was that the boyfriend is supposed to support her, and she even claims it was a test to see how he'd handle tough situations.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here, financial responsibility in relationships can be a touchy subject. There's a common cultural expectation that the guy should cover more expenses, but that doesn't mean it's fair for one person to bear all the financial burden. When they moved in together, splitting the rent equally is a standard practice, so when the girlfriend couldn't contribute, it created an imbalance. The author felt he was sacrificing his own financial stability, which is a valid concern.\n\nThe girlfriend's reasoning that the boyfriend is there to support her seems to ignore the mutual responsibility in a relationship. Healthy relationships require both parties to contribute in some way, whether financially, emotionally, or otherwise. If one person is consistently shouldering all responsibilities without any give and take, it can lead to resentment, which the author is clearly experiencing.\n\nThe author's decision to ask her to leave after she couldn't pay rent again and her comment \"why do I have a boyfriend then?\" might come off as harsh, but given the repeated financial strain and her lack of accountability, it's a reasonable response. The girlfriend's claim that it was a test is dismissive of the author's real financial struggles and the need for trust and reliability in a partnership.\n\nSo, evaluating whether the author is in the wrong: He set expectations early on (though maybe not clearly) by initially covering most costs, but when the situation escalated to living together and financial responsibility became critical, he took a stand. The girlfriend's actions (not contributing and justifying it) likely contributed to the breakdown. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing his financial well-being and setting boundaries after repeated issues.\n"
