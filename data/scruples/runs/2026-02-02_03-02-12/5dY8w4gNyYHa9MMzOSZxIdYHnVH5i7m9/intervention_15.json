Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his girlfriend moved in together, split rent initially, but she couldn't pay her share due to her debts. The author ended up paying the full rent, which put him in a tough financial spot. Then, when the rent came again, she said she couldn't pay anything, and the author kicked her out. She later said it was a test to see how he'd handle it.\n\nHmm. The key points here are financial responsibility in a relationship. The author feels that he's been paying most things and she's not contributing equally. When they moved in together, splitting rent is a common practice, so maybe there was an expectation of shared responsibility. However, the girlfriend had her own financial issues and couldn't contribute. \n\nThe author's actions seem to stem from frustration. He was already in a precarious situation after paying the full rent last time. When she couldn't pay again, he decided to end the relationship. The girlfriend's attitude of expecting the guy to pay everything might be part of the problem. But is the author right to kick her out?\n\nFinancial issues can be a major strain. The author might have felt that he couldn't continue supporting her financially without help. On the other hand, maybe he should have communicated better, tried to find a compromise, or set clearer boundaries earlier. However, in this case, the girlfriend wasn't contributing, and the author's financial well-being was at risk. \n\nThe girlfriend's comment that it was a test seems dismissive of the author's feelings and the real financial impact. That could make the author feel disrespected. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's decision, while perhaps harsh, might be justified given the circumstances. He's prioritizing his own financial stability, which is important. So I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
