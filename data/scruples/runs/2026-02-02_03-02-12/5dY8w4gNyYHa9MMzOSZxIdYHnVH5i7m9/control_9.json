Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who broke up with their girlfriend and kicked her out because she couldn't pay rent is in the wrong. The story is that the guy took on most of the financial responsibilities from the start, even when they were just dating, and then when they moved in together, he expected her to split the rent. But she couldn't pay, and he's now paying all of it and had to cut her off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The guy mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things, but there should be some give and take. In their case, though, she only paid occasionally and cleaned sometimes. When they moved in together, splitting the rent was the norm, but she couldn't contribute, leading him to pay all the rent. He got upset when she couldn't pay again, leading to the breakup.\n\nNow, from a societal standpoint, splitting expenses in a shared living situation is usually expected. If both parties are living in the same place, contributing to the costs is fair. However, the guy already had a pattern of paying most things before they moved in. But when they moved in together, it's a new arrangement. The problem here is that she couldn't keep up her end, which put a strain on his finances.\n\nThe key points here are mutual responsibility and communication. If she knew she couldn't pay her share, maybe she shouldn't have moved in with him. But also, the guy might not have communicated his expectations clearly. However, he did mention that they agreed to split the rent, so her inability to pay might be beyond his control. \n\nThe girl's reaction of treating it as a test seems dismissive and probably added to the guy's frustration. The guy was in a tough spot financially, and her not contributing was a burden. Kicking her out might seem harsh, but considering the financial stress and lack of reciprocity, he might feel it was necessary.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe he could have handled it differently, like finding a compromise or setting clearer boundaries earlier. But given the circumstances, he's trying to protect his own financial stability. So, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. But since he tried to work with her and she couldn't meet her obligations, leading to his decision to end the relationship, it's possible he's not in the wrong. Financial responsibility is a big part of any partnership. So, answer B (No).\n"
