Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a breakup because the girlfriend couldn't pay rent. The author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA). \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple started dating, and the guy ended up paying for most things, including rent after moving in together. The girlfriend wasn't contributing equally, especially with rent. She moved in rent-free for six months, then when they split the rent, she couldn't pay her share. The author ended up paying the full rent twice, which put him in a financial bind. When he asked her to pay back, she refused, leading him to kick her out.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. Let's consider the financial responsibility aspect. In a shared living situation, splitting the rent is usually expected unless otherwise agreed. The girlfriend's inability to pay her share led to the author taking on more financial burden. The author might feel that mutual contributions are necessary in a relationship, especially when living together. \n\nBut then, there's the aspect of communication and expectations. Did they discuss financial responsibilities when moving in? If the author assumed she would contribute and she didn't, maybe there was a miscommunication. However, the girlfriend's response about it being a test for how he'd react to her financial issues seems manipulative. Testing someone's reactions in such a serious matter might not be fair. \n\nThe author's reaction of kicking her out could be seen as extreme if there were no prior discussions about financial expectations. However, considering the ongoing lack of contribution and the financial strain, the author might feel justified. It's also possible that the author should have addressed the issue earlier instead of letting it build up. \n\nFinancial responsibilities in relationships can be a sensitive topic. Different people have different views on splitting costs. Some might argue that in a committed relationship, the man paying for everything is traditional, but that's not a universal stance. The author mentions he believes the guy should pay for most things but expects some give and take. The girlfriend's lack of contribution beyond occasional cleaning might not have met his expectations of balance.\n\nAnother point is the girlfriend staying with a friend for a week. If she left without resolving the financial issue, that could be seen as avoiding responsibility. The author then paying the full rent twice might have been a burden he shouldn't have had to bear alone. \n\nThe final argument from the girlfriend being a test for emergency situations seems like an excuse to justify her lack of responsibility. Emergencies are unforeseen, and expecting the partner to cover all expenses in such cases without prior agreements might be unrealistic. \n\nIn conclusion, while there might be some faults on both sides, the author's action of breaking up due to financial irresponsibility might be justified if there were no prior agreements. However, the author could have handled it differently, like setting clear boundaries earlier. But given the circumstances, the main issue seems to be the girlfriend's consistent failure to contribute financially, leading the author to take a stand.\n"
