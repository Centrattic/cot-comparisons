Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple moved in together, and initially, the guy was covering most expenses. The girlfriend moved in and didn't pay rent for six months, only contributing occasionally. Then, when they moved in together, they split rent for a while. The problem arises when she can't pay her share due to her own debts, leading the guy to pay the full rent, which strains his finances. He asks her to pay back, but she refuses, leading to the breakup.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility and communication. The guy expected some give and take, but the girlfriend's behavior was inconsistent. She admitted she couldn't pay, which put him in a tough spot. When he confronts her, her response is dismissive, implying that having a boyfriend should mean he covers everything. The guy then kicks her out, which seems like a last resort after she refuses to help financially.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From a financial standpoint, splitting rent is a common practice in shared housing. If one person consistently can't contribute, it's reasonable to reassess the living arrangement. The guy tried to work with her, gave her chances, and when she failed to meet her responsibilities, he had to take action to protect his own financial stability. The girlfriend's attitude that the guy should pay everything without expecting support might be a red flag, especially if it's a pattern.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of how he handled it. Kicking someone out might be abrupt, but if they had already moved in together with an understanding to split costs and she was unable or unwilling to meet her share, it's a valid reason to end the cohabitation. The girlfriend's statement that it was a test for his reaction adds another layer, but in reality, real-life situations aren't tests, and relying on a partner's financial support without reciprocation isn't fair.\n\nSo, considering all that, the guy's actions seem justified. He tried to compromise, but when it's no longer viable, ending the relationship and living arrangement is understandable. Therefore, the answer would be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
