Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is at fault for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, the couple was in a relationship where the guy paid for most things, including rent after they moved in together. The girlfriend, according to the author, expected the guy to pay everything, and she didn't contribute much beyond occasional payments and cleaning. Then, when they moved in together, she stopped paying rent altogether, which put the author in a financial bind. He ended the relationship and asked her to leave.\n\nNow, the key points here are the financial responsibilities in a relationship and the fairness of splitting rent. The author mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things but there should be some give and take. However, in this case, the girlfriend wasn't contributing, leading to the author's financial strain.\n\nI should consider common expectations in relationships regarding financial responsibilities. While there's no one-size-fits-all, many couples expect to share expenses, especially when living together. The girlfriend's refusal to contribute to rent could be seen as selfish or irresponsible. The author, on the other hand, tried to be accommodating, even helping with her bills when possible. When she couldn't pay and the author couldn't afford to cover everything, ending the relationship seems like a reasonable decision to protect his own financial well-being.\n\nThe girlfriend's argument that it was a test of his commitment in tough situations might be a justification, but financial responsibility is a two-way street. The author had a right to expect some contribution, especially when living together. The fact that the author was already struggling with debts and bills makes the situation more justified. So, the author isn't in the wrong here; he made a tough but necessary decision to address the imbalance.\n"
