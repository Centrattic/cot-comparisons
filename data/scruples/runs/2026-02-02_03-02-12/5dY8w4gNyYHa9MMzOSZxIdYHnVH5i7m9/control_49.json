Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. The situation involves financial responsibilities and expectations in a relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the details. The author and his girlfriend moved in together, and he took on most financial responsibilities from the start. She paid occasionally but wasn't consistent. When they moved in together, they split the rent initially. However, she stopped paying, leading him to cover the rent, which caused him financial strain. When she couldn't pay again, he kicked her out. She later said it was a test to see how he'd handle stress.\n\nSo, the key points are mutual financial responsibility in a relationship. Typically, in a shared living situation, splitting costs is expected. The girlfriend's refusal to contribute led to the author's financial burden. The author's actions were a response to her not fulfilling her part. However, relationships involve communication and negotiation. The author might have should have addressed the issue earlier, maybe with a more collaborative approach. But the girlfriend's lack of contribution and her justification as a \"test\" could be seen as manipulative. The author's frustration seems justified given the financial strain. However, kicking someone out of a shared home might be extreme. But if they were in a committed relationship and she wasn't contributing, the author's decision could be seen as self-preservation. The answer depends on cultural norms and relationship expectations. In many contexts, sharing expenses is standard, so the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. But if the relationship was unequal from the start, maybe the author should have set clearer boundaries. Still, the final action was a result of her not meeting agreed-upon responsibilities. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
