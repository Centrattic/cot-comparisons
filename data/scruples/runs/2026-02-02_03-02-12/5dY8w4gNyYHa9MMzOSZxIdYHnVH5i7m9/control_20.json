Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a breakup because the girlfriend couldn't pay rent. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things but expects some give and take. He supported her financially with dinners, events, groceries, etc., even though she sometimes contributed. But when they moved in together, splitting the rent, she stopped paying her share after a few months. She cited her own debts, and he ended up paying full rent, which strained his finances. When he asked her to pay back or at least cover her part, she dismissed it by saying \"why do I have a boyfriend then?\" He then kicked her out. She later claimed it was a test to see how he'd handle tough situations.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Financial responsibility in relationships is a common issue. When two people live together, especially in a shared apartment, splitting costs is typically expected unless agreed otherwise. The author initially agreed to split the rent, so when she couldn't pay, he had to cover it. However, he's now being asked if he was wrong to kick her out because she couldn't pay. \n\nLegally, if the lease is under his name, he's the one responsible for the rent, but if she's a co-tenant, she's also legally obligated to pay. However, the situation is more about their personal agreement. The key points are: 1) Did he have a fair agreement? 2) Was her refusal to pay justified? 3) Was his reaction (kicking her out) appropriate?\n\nThe author argues that he was helping her manage her debts, but she didn't reciprocate. Her response of \"why do I have a boyfriend\" implies she expected him to handle all financial issues, which he found unfair. He ended the relationship because her financial irresponsibility was affecting his own situation.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, expecting a partner to cover all your financial issues without contribution can be seen as selfish. Relationships should involve mutual support, not one-sided financial dependence. However, financial habits are personal, and not everyone has the same capacity. The author's frustration is understandable if he felt taken advantage of.\n\nBut was he wrong? If they had a mutual agreement to split rent, and she couldn't pay, he might have the right to ask her to leave if she's not meeting her responsibilities. However, some might argue that expecting a partner to cover all financial issues in a crisis isn't realistic, but in this case, it's more about recurring inability to pay rather than an emergency. She admitted it was a test, which shows a lack of consideration for his financial strain.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions seem justified given the context. He followed through on his boundaries after repeated issues. She didn't take responsibility, so he ended the relationship to protect his own financial health. Therefore, he's not in the wrong.\n"
