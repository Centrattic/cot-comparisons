Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote about breaking up with his girlfriend over her not paying rent is in the wrong. I need to figure out if he did the right thing or not.\n\nFirst, the situation: The man and his girlfriend moved in together. Initially, he paid for most things, including rent after she couldn't pay. She contributed occasionally but not equally. When she couldn't pay rent again, he kicked her out. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nLooking at their arrangement, it seems like there was an expectation of shared responsibility. When they moved in together, splitting rent is typical. The girlfriend's inability to contribute financially might be due to her debts, but that's a personal financial issue. The man was helping her out, but when his own financial situation was strained, he decided to end the relationship. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, it's about mutual support. If one partner is consistently putting the other in a financial hole, that's a problem. The man might have felt that his support wasn't reciprocated, leading to the breakup. He might be justified in setting boundaries, especially if the financial burden was unsustainable. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have expected the man to continue supporting her through her debts. However, the man has his own responsibilities. The key here is whether there was an agreement or expectation of support. Since the man was already helping with most expenses and she wasn't contributing when needed, his decision to end the relationship could be seen as self-preservation. \n\nThe girlfriend's comment about it being a test is problematic. Using a partner's reaction to financial stress as a test isn't healthy. The man's response was to prioritize his own financial stability, which is reasonable. \n\nConsidering all this, the man isn't in the wrong. He set a boundary when the situation became untenable. Financial responsibility is important in a relationship, and expecting equal contribution is reasonable. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
