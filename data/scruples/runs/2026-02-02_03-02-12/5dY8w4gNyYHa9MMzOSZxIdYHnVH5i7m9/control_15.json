Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author broke up with his girlfriend and kicked her out of his apartment because she couldn't pay rent. He mentions that he was the one paying most of the expenses even before they moved in together, and after moving in, she started not contributing. The final straw was when she couldn't pay rent again and he had to cover it all, leading him to ask her to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author states that he believed the guy should pay for most things, which might be a personal belief. However, when they moved in together, splitting the rent is a common expectation. The girlfriend's inability to pay might be due to her financial situation, but the author was handling most of the costs, which could lead to financial strain on him.\n\nFinancial responsibilities in relationships can be tricky. The author might feel that there's an imbalance, especially if he's paying for most things and she's not contributing equally. However, moving in together often requires shared responsibilities. The girlfriend's statement about it being a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation is concerning. Testing someone's limits in such a critical area (like rent) could be seen as manipulative or inconsiderate.\n\nThe author's response was to ask her to leave, which is a significant action. Breaking up is a personal decision, but doing so because of financial disagreements might be justified depending on the circumstances. However, if the girlfriend had debts and couldn't pay, perhaps the author could have explored other solutions, like adjusting the payment terms or budgeting together. That said, if the author felt it was unsustainable and his own financial stability was at risk, his decision might be understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have overreacted by immediately kicking her out instead of trying to communicate or find a compromise. Financial issues can be resolved through discussion, but if repeated attempts failed, then the author's decision could be seen as necessary for his own well-being. The girlfriend's lack of response to the author's concerns and her testing behavior might have justified his actions.\n\nSo, considering all factors: the author had financial responsibilities, his partner wasn't contributing, and after multiple issues, he decided to end the relationship to protect his finances. The girlfriend's behavior seems to have contributed to the problem. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
