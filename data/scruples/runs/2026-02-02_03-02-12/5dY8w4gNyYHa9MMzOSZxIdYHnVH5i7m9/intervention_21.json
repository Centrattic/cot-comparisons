Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up and asking his girlfriend to leave because she couldn't pay rent.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy has been in a relationship where he's been paying for most things, including rent after they moved in together. The girlfriend isn't contributing equally, especially with financial responsibilities. When they moved in together, she initially helped split the rent but later couldn't pay, leading to him covering her share, which is causing him financial strain. He broke up with her, and she claims it was a test to see how he'd handle a tough situation, like an accident. The author is questioning if he was wrong to do this.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. Financial responsibilities in a relationship can be a sensitive issue. The key points here are the unequal sharing of expenses and the breakdown in communication. The author mentions that he was paying for most things, including groceries, dinners, etc., while she occasionally paid. When they moved in together, splitting the rent was an agreement, but she stopped contributing, leading to the author covering her share. This created a financial burden on him, so he decided to end the relationship. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, it's reasonable to expect that both partners contribute to shared expenses when living together. The girlfriend's inability to pay rent due to her own debts and then not helping financially could be seen as unfair. The author's frustration is valid because he's taking on a disproportionate share, which affects his own financial stability. \n\nHowever, some might argue that in relationships, especially where one person is financially better off, it's normal for one to cover more. But when it becomes a constant one-sided situation, it's unsustainable. The girlfriend's attitude of expecting the guy to pay everything without give and take is problematic. The author's decision to end the relationship to avoid further financial strain is a personal choice, and while it's a difficult situation, it's his right to decide his own financial limits.\n\nThe girlfriend's claim that it was a test is a red flag. Using someone's financial resources without their consent isn't acceptable. The author's reaction, while harsh, stems from feeling exploited. He's taking responsibility for his own finances and setting boundaries. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a moral judgment. Legally, he's within his rights to end the relationship. Emotionally, it's a tough decision, but given the circumstances, he's prioritizing his own well-being. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
