Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, looking at the situation: The author and his girlfriend moved in together, and initially split the rent. However, she started having financial issues and couldn't contribute, leading him to pay the full rent. He tried to get her to pay back, but she refused, leading to the breakup.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's been covering most expenses, and when they moved in together, he expected some give and take. But when she couldn't pay her share, especially over an extended period, he felt it was unfair. The girlfriend's response that it was a test of his commitment adds another layer. \n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics and financial responsibilities, it's common for couples to discuss and agree on splitting bills. If there's no prior agreement, disagreements can arise. The author tried to be accommodating before, but her inability to contribute financially when living together might have crossed a line for him. \n\nThe girlfriend's approach of staying with a friend for a week and not taking responsibility for rent payments seems irresponsible. The author's decision to end the relationship because he couldn't afford to support her financially without any reciprocity is understandable. \n\nHowever, breaking up and kicking someone out immediately might be seen as extreme, but given the financial stress and lack of compromise, it's a valid decision from his perspective. The key points are mutual agreement on financial responsibilities and the willingness to support each other. If she couldn't meet her part, the author was within his rights to set boundaries. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. He addressed the issue after multiple attempts, and when she couldn't contribute, he made a tough but necessary choice. The answer is B.\n"
