Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author did the right thing here. The situation is that the author broke up with his girlfriend because she couldn't pay rent after moving in together. He's arguing that he paid for most things before, including rent, and now she's not contributing, leading to financial strain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider their agreement about splitting the rent. If they had a mutual understanding at the beginning that they would split the rent equally, then her not contributing could be a problem. However, if there was no clear agreement, maybe he shouldn't have assumed she'd pay her share. But in many relationships, especially when moving in together, splitting costs is a common expectation. \n\nThe girlfriend's behavior seems inconsistent. She moved in and didn't pay her share initially, then later refused to contribute even when asked. The author took financial hits to cover her part, which might have been okay if she was willing to reciprocate, but she wasn't. Her reasoning that she's there to help in tough situations doesn't hold when she's the one causing the financial burden. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's attitude where she expects the guy to pay everything might be a red flag. The author mentions that he believed in paying most, but there should be some give and take. Her lack of contribution breaks that balance. \n\nThe author's reaction was to kick her out because he couldn't afford the full rent alone. That seems extreme, but given the context, he might have felt it was necessary to protect his financial stability. If she couldn't meet her responsibilities, ending the relationship and living situation makes sense. \n\nHowever, some might argue that he should have addressed the issue earlier instead of letting it build up. But the situation had been ongoing with her not contributing, so maybe he had the right to take action when it became unsustainable. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't at fault for standing up for his financial well-being. The girlfriend's actions were the main issue here. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
