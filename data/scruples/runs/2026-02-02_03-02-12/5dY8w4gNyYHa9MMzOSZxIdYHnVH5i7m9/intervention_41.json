Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend and kicking her out because she couldn't pay rent. The situation involves financial responsibilities in a relationship. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that the girlfriend believed the guy should pay for everything. He initially went along with this, covering most expenses, and she contributed occasionally. When they moved in together, they split the rent, but she stopped paying her share due to her own debts. He paid the full rent, which caused him financial strain. When he asked her to pay back or contribute, she refused, leading him to kick her out.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility in a relationship. The author felt that the arrangement wasn't equal, especially when she couldn't meet her financial obligations. The girlfriend's reasoning for not paying rent was because of her debts and even implied that the author should help her out. The author decided that he couldn't continue supporting her financially and ended the relationship.\n\nNow, considering social norms and relationship dynamics, it's generally expected that both partners contribute to shared expenses when living together. The author tried to be accommodating but reached a breaking point when his own financial health was at risk. The girlfriend's expectation that the author should cover everything, even to the point of her saying \"why do I have a boyfriend then?\" seems unreasonable. \n\nThe girlfriend's test of how he would react in a tough situation (like an accident) is a red flag. Using a hypothetical emergency to justify not paying rent is not a valid excuse. Emergencies are unpredictable, but she's using a personal financial issue as a test, which shows a lack of responsibility and consideration for the author's situation.\n\nThe author's actions in setting boundaries and prioritizing his own financial stability are understandable. He's not obligated to support someone financially if it jeopardizes his own well-being. Relationships require mutual respect and compromise, and the girlfriend's behavior didn't reflect that. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. He made a difficult decision to protect his own interests after repeated failures to find a fair middle ground. The girlfriend's actions were the main issue here, not the author's response.\n"
