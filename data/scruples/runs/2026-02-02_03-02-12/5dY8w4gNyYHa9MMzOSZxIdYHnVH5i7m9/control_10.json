Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a breakup because the girlfriend couldn't pay rent.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things but expects some give and take. When they moved in together, they split rent initially, but she stopped contributing due to her debts. He ended up paying all the rent, leading to financial strain. He decided to kick her out because she wasn't contributing, and she later said it was a test. Now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nSo, the question is whether he overreacted or not. The options are A (yes, he's wrong) or B (no, he's not). To decide, I need to consider social norms around financial responsibilities in relationships, fairness, and communication.\n\nIn many relationships, splitting expenses is a common practice unless otherwise agreed. The author might have thought that he should take on most costs, but when it comes to living together, splitting rent is standard. The girlfriend's refusal to contribute could be seen as a lack of consideration for her partner's financial situation. The author's frustration seems justified given the financial strain. However, the way he handled it\u2014kicking her out\u2014might be seen as harsh, especially if there was prior agreement or if communication was lacking. \n\nAlso, her claiming it was a test complicates things. If she intentionally created a stressful situation to see his reaction, maybe the author's response was appropriate. On the other hand, if he didn't communicate his expectations clearly from the start, that could be his fault. But the narrative suggests that she didn't contribute even after being asked, leading to him making a firm decision. \n\nFinancial responsibility in relationships is important for both parties. If one person is consistently not pulling their weight, it's reasonable to reevaluate the relationship. The author's financial difficulties might make his actions understandable. However, some might argue that breaking up over financial issues could be seen as the man being too controlling or not compromising enough. \n\nConsidering all these factors, the author's actions might not be in the wrong because he was protecting his financial stability. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
