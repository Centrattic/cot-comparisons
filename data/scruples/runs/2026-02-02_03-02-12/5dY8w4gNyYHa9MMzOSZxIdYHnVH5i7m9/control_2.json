Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their girlfriend for not paying rent is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the context: The couple moved in together, initially splitting rent. The girlfriend then stopped contributing because of her debts, expecting the partner to cover everything. The partner paid the full rent, leading to financial strain, and eventually kicked her out. The girlfriend claims it was a test of his commitment in case of her emergencies. The partner is now facing financial issues because they're covering all expenses alone.\n\nNow, considering financial responsibilities in a relationship. While some couples might have different expectations, the key here is that they had an agreement to split the rent, which was then broken by the girlfriend. The partner had to cover it alone, which caused them financial problems. The girlfriend's argument about a test for emergencies doesn't hold water in this case because the situation is about ongoing financial responsibility, not a one-time emergency. The partner's frustration is valid if they expected mutual financial contributions. However, the way he reacted\u2014kicking her out\u2014might be harsh, but given the context of repeated non-payment and the financial strain, it's a decision made out of necessity. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, relationships often require compromise. The partner might have set unclear expectations from the start if they didn't discuss financial responsibilities upfront. However, once the agreement was broken, taking action to protect his own financial stability is understandable. The girlfriend's approach of testing his reaction is problematic. The partner acted to resolve the ongoing issue, so he's not necessarily in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
