Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a breakup where the author kicked his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and his girlfriend moved in together, split rent initially, but she couldn't pay her share. He ends up paying all the rent, leading to financial strain. She seems to expect him to cover her debts, and he kicks her out. She later says it was a test of his reaction to tough situations.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for breaking up and kicking her out. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider factors like financial responsibility in relationships, communication issues, fairness, and mutual expectations. The author mentions that he believed the guy should pay most, but there needs to be give and take. However, she wasn't contributing. When they moved in together, they agreed to split the rent, but she couldn't hold up her end. The financial burden shifted entirely to him, causing him stress.\n\nThe girlfriend's behavior here is questionable. Expecting a partner to cover all expenses without any reciprocity is problematic. The author made a decision to end the relationship when his financial stability was at risk. He tried to communicate and set boundaries, which is reasonable. \n\nBut some might argue that relationships require compromise and that the author could have handled it differently, like discussing money issues before moving in together. However, in this case, the girlfriend wasn't meeting her responsibilities, leading to the author's financial strain. \n\nThe girlfriend's statement about it being a test is concerning. Using a partner's financial situation as a test is manipulative and shows a lack of respect for the partner's circumstances. \n\nIn terms of legal and social norms, if someone can't pay their share of the rent, the other person isn't obligated to cover it. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing his financial well-being. He made a difficult but necessary decision when his partner failed to uphold her part of the agreement.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author isn't in the wrong. His actions were a response to her failure to meet responsibilities, and he tried to address it through communication before taking drastic measures. The key issue here is the lack of reciprocity and the girlfriend's unrealistic expectations.\n"
