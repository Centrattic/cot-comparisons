Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author and their girlfriend moved in together, and initially, he covered most expenses, including rent, dinners, trips, etc. She paid occasionally and helped with cleaning. Then, when they moved in together, she stopped paying rent, which put the author in a tough financial spot. When he confronted her, she justified it by saying \"why do I have a boyfriend then?\" and later claimed it was a test. The author then kicked her out and is now handling rent alone.\n\nSo, the main issue is financial responsibility in a relationship. The author believes that while the guy should pay for most things, there should be some give and take. The girlfriend's actions led to the author's financial strain, and he felt compelled to end the relationship.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, splitting rent when living together is standard. If one partner can't contribute, that's a significant issue. The author tried to be understanding when she first couldn't pay but was met with a lack of accountability. The girlfriend's attitude, especially the \"why do I have a boyfriend\" comment, suggests a lack of responsibility and entitlement. The author's decision to end the relationship to protect his financial stability seems reasonable.\n\nHowever, maybe the author should have tried to resolve the issue more amicably before kicking her out. But given that she wasn't taking responsibility and was causing financial harm, the author's actions are understandable. The girlfriend's test claim seems like an excuse to justify her behavior, and the author is right to prioritize his own financial well-being.\n\nSo, I think the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
