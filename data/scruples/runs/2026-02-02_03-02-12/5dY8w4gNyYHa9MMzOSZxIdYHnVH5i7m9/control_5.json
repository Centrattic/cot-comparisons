Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author had a girlfriend who moved into his apartment. They didn't split rent equally after some time, and she couldn't pay her share because of her own debts. The author paid the full rent, which put him in a tough financial spot. When she again couldn't pay, he kicked her out. She later said it was a test to see how he'd handle tough situations, but he feels it's different.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. Financial responsibility in relationships is a common issue. The author mentions he believed the guy should pay for most things but expected some give and take. When they moved in together, splitting rent is standard, but she couldn't contribute. The author had to cover everything, which strained his finances. When she refused to pay and justified it by saying \"why do I have a boyfriend,\" that's where he drew the line.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions seem to be putting the author in a position where he's financially supporting her while she's in debt. The author's reaction was to end the relationship and ask her to leave. The girlfriend's reasoning as a test is questionable because it's using a hypothetical (like an accident) to justify not contributing, which isn't the same as a real financial emergency. \n\nLegally, if they were roommates, both would be responsible for their share of the rent. If the author was the sole leaseholder, he might be obligated to pay, but that's a different scenario. However, the ethical aspect here is about mutual responsibility. The author felt it was unfair to bear all financial burdens while she contributed minimally. His decision to end the relationship because of this seems like a boundary he set, which is his right. \n\nHowever, some might argue that kicking someone out during a financial crisis could be harsh, especially if the author had the means to support them temporarily. But the author mentions that this put him in a precarious situation, implying he couldn't afford to carry the full cost. \n\nThe girlfriend's attitude that the boyfriend should always pay without reciprocity is problematic. The author tried to balance things, but when the arrangement became unsustainable, he took action. The girlfriend's test rationale doesn't hold water because it's manipulative and doesn't address the real financial responsibilities in a relationship. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and ending the relationship when the financial imbalance became too much. The girlfriend's behavior was irresponsible, and the author acted to protect his own financial well-being.\n"
