Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a breakup because the girlfriend couldn't pay rent. The user is asking if the author did the right thing by breaking up and kicking her out.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. The author mentions that he paid for most things, even groceries, and she only helped occasionally. When they moved in together, she initially split the rent but then stopped, saying she had her own debts. He ended up paying all the rent, which put him in a tough financial spot. When he asked her to pay back or help, she said things like \"why do I have a boyfriend then?\" which is a pretty dismissive attitude. He then kicked her out because he felt she wasn't contributing and was taking advantage.\n\nNow, considering relationship norms. Traditionally, some people believe the guy should pay more, but there's also an expectation of mutual support. If both are in a relationship, especially living together, splitting bills is usually expected unless otherwise agreed. The woman's refusal to contribute, especially after the initial agreement to split rent, seems like a breach of trust. The author's frustration is understandable, especially with his own financial responsibilities. He ended up paying full rent, which affects his ability to manage his own debts. \n\nHer reasoning that it was a test for how he'd react in an emergency is a bit of a cop-out. Testing someone's character in a real-life situation by not contributing to shared expenses isn't fair. The author's reaction was to set boundaries, which is valid. He's prioritizing his own financial stability after being taken advantage of repeatedly.\n\nBut maybe some would argue that the author could have handled it differently, like setting clearer expectations from the start or not allowing her to move in if he knew she couldn't pay. However, he did split the rent initially and tried to work with her. Her not paying back and dismissing his requests makes her the one in the wrong. The author's decision to end the relationship because of financial irresponsibility is a personal choice, but given her actions, it's justified. So the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
