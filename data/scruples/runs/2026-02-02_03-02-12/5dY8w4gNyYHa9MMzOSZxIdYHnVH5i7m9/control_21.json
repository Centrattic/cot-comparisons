Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, looking at the situation: the couple moved in together, initially split the rent, but then she couldn't pay her share. The author ends up covering all the rent, leading to financial strain for himself. He's upset because he feels the responsibility is all on him, and she's not contributing. The girlfriend seems to have the mindset that the guy should pay everything, and she's not helping out financially. \n\nThe key points here are about financial responsibility in a relationship. When two people live together, splitting costs is usually expected. If one partner can't contribute, it's a problem. The author mentions that he's helping her with various expenses, but she's not giving back. Now, when they live together, she can't pay rent, which is a major expense. The author is putting himself in a bad financial position to cover her part. \n\nThe girlfriend's behavior seems to be a pattern. She's not meeting her obligations, and when confronted, she's dismissive, even framing it as a test. The author's reaction is to end the relationship and ask her to leave. He's standing up for himself financially, which makes sense. \n\nBut wait, is there a cultural context? The author says he believes the guy should pay for most things, but expects some give and take. However, when it comes to major expenses like rent in a shared home, it's expected that both contribute. If she's unable to pay, maybe there's a deeper issue like financial instability. \n\nThe author might be overreacting in terms of breaking up immediately. Could he have tried to communicate better, find a compromise? However, given that she's been avoiding payment and not taking responsibility, his actions might be justified. He's protecting his own financial health. \n\nIs there any fault on the author's side? Maybe not considering if she had valid reasons, but she's been consistent in not paying. The author's decision to end the relationship after repeated issues seems reasonable. \n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong, the author might not be. The girlfriend's refusal to contribute and her attitude are problematic. The author is asserting his boundaries, which is important. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
