Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend and kicking her out because she couldn't pay rent.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The author and his girlfriend moved in together, and initially split the rent. Then she couldn't pay her share due to her debts. He ended up covering the rent, which put him in a tough financial spot. She continued to not contribute, and when confronted, she said something like \"why do I have a boyfriend then?\" implying he should take care of everything. The author then kicks her out, and she claims it was a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation.\n\nSo, the key points are financial responsibility in a relationship. The author believed in the guy paying for most things but expected some give and take. The girlfriend, however, didn't contribute as expected, leading to financial strain on the author. He felt it was unfair to support her financially while his own debts grew. \n\nI need to consider cultural norms. In many relationships, especially in the US, it's common for couples to split expenses when living together. If one partner isn't contributing, it can create conflict. The author's frustration is understandable if he's shouldering all the financial burden, especially when he's mentioned that she's in a mindset where the guy should pay everything. The girlfriend's expectation that the author should cover everything without contributing herself might be unrealistic. \n\nThe author's decision to end the relationship might be seen as a response to the financial imbalance. However, kicking someone out of an apartment can be a harsh action. Legal aspects might come into play depending on the lease agreements and local laws. If they were co-tenants, he might need a legal reason to remove her. But the user isn't asking about legality, just if he's in the wrong morally or ethically.\n\nThe girlfriend claiming it was a test complicates things. If she was testing his reaction, that's problematic. It suggests she wasn't being honest about her financial situation, which could be a breach of trust. The author might feel betrayed if she used the situation to see how he'd handle it without being upfront.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could be seen as inconsiderate if he didn't discuss the financial issues earlier. Maybe he should have addressed the imbalance before moving in together. But it's also possible he tried to be accommodating, expecting some reciprocity, which didn't happen.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions stem from frustration over financial strain and unfair expectations. His decision, while extreme, might be justified given the circumstances. The girlfriend's lack of contribution and the test comment don't support the author's position. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
