Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a breakup because the girlfriend couldn't pay rent. The author is the one who broke up with her and asked her to leave the apartment.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The author mentions that they were in a relationship where he paid for most things, including rent after moving in together. The girlfriend initially helped with some expenses and cleaning, but he felt it wasn't equal. When they moved in together, she stopped paying rent after two months, citing her own financial issues. The author ended up paying full rent, which put him in a tough spot. When he asked her to pay back or contribute, she refused, leading to the breakup.\n\nNow, from a fairness standpoint, relationships usually require mutual effort and support. However, there's a point where one person's contributions become one-sided. The author mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things, but there should be some give and take. The girlfriend, however, seems to have relied entirely on him financially without reciprocating, especially after moving in together. \n\nFinancial responsibility in a relationship is a big deal. If both people are supposed to contribute to shared expenses like rent, and one can't or won't, that's a problem. The author had to cover the rent himself, which led to his own financial strain. The girlfriend's attitude, especially when she said \"why do I have a boyfriend then?\" implies that she expected the author to handle all financial issues without any help from her. \n\nThe girlfriend's claim that it was a test for how he'd react in tough situations (like an accident) seems dismissive of the author's actual financial struggles. Accidents are emergencies, but her ongoing refusal to contribute to rent isn't the same. The author had to manage his own debts and bills while covering her rent, which isn't fair. \n\nIn relationships, especially when sharing a home, financial responsibilities should be discussed and agreed upon. If one person can't meet those responsibilities, it's reasonable to reassess the living situation. The author's decision to end the relationship because of the financial imbalance seems justified. He's not at fault for wanting a balanced relationship where both parties contribute. \n\nHowever, some might argue that relationships involve support during tough times. But there's a difference between temporary support and ongoing, one-sided financial dependence. The girlfriend's situation seems to be the latter, which is more about her not taking responsibility rather than a temporary hardship. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. He set boundaries when they were crossed, and the girlfriend's behavior was irresponsible. The answer should be B.\n"
