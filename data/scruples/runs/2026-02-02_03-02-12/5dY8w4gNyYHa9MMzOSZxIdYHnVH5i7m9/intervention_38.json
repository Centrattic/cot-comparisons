Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong when they broke up and asked their girlfriend to leave because she couldn't pay rent. The key points here are about financial responsibility in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they paid for most things, including rent, groceries, and other expenses after the girlfriend moved in. They expected some give and take but felt it wasn't balanced. When moving in together, they split rent initially, but the girlfriend couldn't pay her share due to her debts. The author ended up paying the full rent, which put them in a tough financial spot. The girlfriend's justification was that the guy should pay for things, and she even considered the situation a test of how the author would handle her financial issues.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to assess both sides. Financial responsibilities in relationships can vary, but mutual support is important. However, expecting one partner to bear all financial burdens without reciprocity can lead to problems. The author tried to compromise but felt exploited when the girlfriend couldn't contribute, leading to the breakup. The girlfriend's attitude of relying on the partner's financial stability might be an issue. The author's decision to end the relationship seems justified if there's no mutual effort to manage shared expenses. The girlfriend's \"test\" explanation might be an excuse rather than a valid reason. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing their own financial stability.\n"
