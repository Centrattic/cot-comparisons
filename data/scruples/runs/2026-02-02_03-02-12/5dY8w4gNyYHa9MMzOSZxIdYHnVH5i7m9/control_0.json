Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a breakup where the author kicked their girlfriend out of their apartment because she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the details provided. The girlfriend moved into the author's apartment in June 2018 and lived there without paying rent, bills, or groceries for six months. The author mentions that the girlfriend occasionally paid for something and cleaned, but it wasn't equal. When they moved in together, they split rent for a couple of months, but then she couldn't pay, leading the author to cover the full rent again. This happened again, and the author decided to end the relationship and kick her out. The girlfriend later claims it was a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation.\n\nSo, the main issue here is financial responsibility in a relationship. The author feels that while he's used to paying for most things, there should be some reciprocity. The girlfriend, however, didn't contribute as much, leading to financial strain on the author. He breaks up with her because he can't support her financially anymore. \n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. In relationships, especially those involving shared living expenses, financial contributions are often discussed. The author might have not set clear boundaries from the start. Letting her live rent-free for six months without any agreement could be seen as enabling her to avoid responsibility. However, when they moved in together, they did split the rent initially, which suggests an agreement. The girlfriend's inability to pay after that period and the author's financial strain are key points. \n\nThe author's decision to end the relationship seems to be based on the financial burden and the girlfriend's lack of contribution. The girlfriend's argument that it was a test is questionable, as financial irresponsibility isn't a valid test, especially in a committed relationship. The author's frustration is understandable given the financial pressure and the one-sided support.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have addressed the issue earlier, perhaps through communication rather than sudden eviction. However, given the repeated instances where the girlfriend failed to meet her financial obligations, the author's actions might be justified as a necessary step to protect his own financial stability. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's actions seem reasonable under the circumstances. He's taking responsibility for his own situation and setting a boundary when the relationship becomes unsustainable financially. The girlfriend's behavior, expecting the author to cover all expenses without contribution, is more problematic. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
