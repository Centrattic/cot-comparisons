Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author of the given situation is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking his girlfriend out of his apartment because she couldn't pay rent. The answer options are A for yes or B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario thoroughly. The main points are that the couple moved in together, initially split rent, but the girlfriend couldn't pay her share due to her debts. The author ended up paying the full rent, which put him in a tough financial spot. When she couldn't pay again, he asked her to leave. She later claimed it was a test to see how he'd react in a crisis.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let's break down the factors.\n\nFinancial responsibility is a key issue here. In a shared living situation, splitting costs is typical. The girlfriend's inability to contribute, especially when she knew her financial situation, could be a problem. The author mentions that she expected him to pay for most things, which he did out of his own judgment. When moving in together, they agreed to split rent, but she couldn't hold up her end. This led to the author taking on more financial burden, which he couldn't sustain.\n\nCommunication is another aspect. The author tried to talk to her about repayment, but she didn't respond clearly. When he confronted her, she gave a dismissive answer about testing him. This lack of communication and accountability on her part might justify his decision.\n\nHowever, relationships involve compromise. The author paid for most things even when he felt it wasn't equal. But when moving in together, they made a mutual agreement to split rent, which she couldn't fulfill. If someone can't meet their financial obligations in a shared living arrangement, it's reasonable for the other person to expect them to leave, especially if it's causing financial strain.\n\nThe girlfriend's attitude, where she seems to think the partner should always cover costs, might be problematic. The author's frustration is valid if he feels he's shouldering all the financial responsibility without reciprocation. Kicking her out after she repeatedly can't pay might be seen as a necessary step to protect his own financial stability.\n\nOn the other hand, breaking up over this could be seen as harsh if there were other factors or if he could have been more flexible. But given the repeated issues and her apparent lack of accountability, it's a valid choice. Also, the girlfriend's comment about it being a test comes off as manipulative, which might support the author's decision.\n\nIn relationships, financial compatibility is crucial. If both parties can't be on the same page about finances, it's hard to sustain. The author's actions stem from a place of needing to manage his own finances responsibly. So, he's not necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing his financial health, especially when the other person isn't contributing their share.\n"
