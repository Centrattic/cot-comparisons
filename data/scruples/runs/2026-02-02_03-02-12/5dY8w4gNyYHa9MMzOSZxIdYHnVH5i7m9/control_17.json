Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves their girlfriend not paying rent, and them breaking up and kicking her out. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that from the start, the girlfriend expected him to pay for most things. Even when they moved in together, she didn't contribute equally. Then, she couldn't pay rent because of her debts, and he ended up paying everything, which strained his finances. The final breaking point was when she said she couldn't pay again and even implied it was part of a test.\n\nSo, financial responsibility is a big part here. In a relationship, especially roommates, splitting costs is usually expected. If one person isn't contributing, especially when they had agreed to split the rent, that's a problem. The author tried to be understanding initially, helping out with various expenses, but it became unequal. The girlfriend's attitude of expecting him to pay everything and not taking responsibility for her share of the rent when they moved in together seems like a major issue.\n\nThe author's decision to end the relationship over this might be seen as a last resort after repeated failures to resolve the financial imbalance. The girlfriend's justification of testing his reaction to a tough situation comes off as manipulative and unfair, especially since the scenario she's referencing (like an accident) is different from her own financial irresponsibility.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have addressed the issue earlier or communicated more effectively before taking the drastic step of asking her to leave. However, given the repeated instances of her not paying her share and the financial strain it caused, his reaction seems justified. It's about mutual responsibility in a relationship, and if one person isn't meeting their end, especially in something as fundamental as rent, ending it isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
