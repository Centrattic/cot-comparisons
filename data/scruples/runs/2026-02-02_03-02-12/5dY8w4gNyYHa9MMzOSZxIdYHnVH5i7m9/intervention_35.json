Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a breakup where the author kicked his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend moved in and didn't contribute to rent or bills for six months. The author mentions that even before moving in together, she was used to him paying for most things, and he helped with dinners, events, groceries, etc. She sometimes paid for something and cleaned, but he felt it wasn't equal. Now, after moving in together, she can't pay rent due to her debts, and she expects him to cover it again. The author gets fed up, kicks her out, and she says it was a test to see how he'd react in tough situations. The author is wondering if he was wrong to kick her out.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From my perspective, the key points are financial responsibility and mutual contributions in a relationship. The author tried to split the rent initially but she couldn't pay. He continued to cover her share, which added to his own financial strain. The girlfriend seems to have an expectation that he'll always support her financially, which he's not comfortable with. The author made a decision to end the relationship because he felt it was unfair and unsustainable. \n\nThe girlfriend's reasoning that it was a test for emergencies doesn't seem valid here. If she can't manage her own finances, expecting her partner to cover her debts is unreasonable. The author acted in his own financial interests, which is understandable. Relationships require compromise, but there's a limit to how much one person should bear the burden. The fact that he was already struggling with his own bills and debts makes his decision more justified. \n\nSo, I think the author is not in the wrong. He set boundaries when he couldn't take it anymore. The girlfriend's behavior was inconsiderate, and the author prioritized his financial stability. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
