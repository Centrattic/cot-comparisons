Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend for not paying rent is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend moved in, wasn't paying her share, and he ended up paying everything, leading to financial strain. The author is arguing that he's not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The author mentions that he initially paid for most things, expecting some give and take. When they moved in together, splitting rent was part of the agreement, but she couldn't pay her share. This led to him covering the rent, which put him in a tough spot financially. The final straw was when she said she wouldn't help with rent even though he was already struggling.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility and mutual agreement. When two people live together, especially in a romantic relationship, sharing expenses is typically expected. If one person consistently isn't contributing, it can create tension and financial hardship. The author's decision to end the relationship because she couldn't pay her share might be seen as a reaction to her not meeting her obligations.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of communication. The author might have considered discussing financial expectations before moving in together. But in this case, they did split rent initially, and the girlfriend later couldn't pay. The author's frustration is understandable given the financial strain. The girlfriend's attitude that the guy should pay everything might have been a red flag from the start, but he went along with it, which complicates things a bit.\n\nThe girlfriend's comment about testing his reaction in a tough situation is also important. It suggests she might have been using the situation to see how he'd handle it, which is inconsiderate and unfair. The author's reaction\u2014breaking up and kicking her out\u2014could be seen as a last resort to protect his own financial stability.\n\nFinancial issues are a common reason for breakups, and it's hard to blame someone for prioritizing their own financial health. The author made a tough choice, but it's a valid decision given the circumstances. The girlfriend's lack of contribution and the author's financial stress make his actions understandable. So, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
