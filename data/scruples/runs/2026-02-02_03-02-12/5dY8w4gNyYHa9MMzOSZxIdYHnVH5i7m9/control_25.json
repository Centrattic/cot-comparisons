Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend and kicked her out of his apartment for not paying rent is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend and girlfriend moved in together. Initially, he paid for most things, and she occasionally contributed. When they moved in together, they split the rent for a while, but then she couldn't pay her share due to her own debts. He paid full rent, which strained his finances. When she couldn't pay again, he kicked her out. She later said it was a test.\n\nSo, the main issue is financial responsibility in a relationship. The key points here are mutual agreements, communication, and expectations. In a shared living situation, splitting costs like rent is usually expected unless otherwise agreed. The girlfriend's inability or unwillingness to contribute, especially after agreeing to split the rent, could be a breach of that agreement. \n\nThe boyfriend's perspective is that he took on more than his fair share, leading to financial strain. He acted to protect his own financial stability by asking her to leave. The girlfriend, on the other hand, seems to have had different expectations, expecting the boyfriend to cover everything, which might not be fair in a cohabiting relationship. \n\nThe girlfriend's claim that she was testing his reaction to financial stress is problematic. Using someone's financial situation as a test without discussing it openly is inconsiderate. The boyfriend had a right to expect her to fulfill her part of the agreement, and when she couldn't, he made a decision to end the relationship and the living arrangement.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of communication. Did they have a clear agreement about financial responsibilities from the start? If the boyfriend assumed she would pay her share and she didn't, then he's not at fault. But if he was aware she couldn't pay and still let her stay, maybe he shares some responsibility. But in this case, he tried to set boundaries when she couldn't pay, and she didn't meet her end. \n\nFinancial accountability is crucial in relationships, especially when living together. The boyfriend's actions were to address the imbalance, so he's not necessarily in the wrong. The girlfriend's behavior of not contributing and testing him is the issue. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
