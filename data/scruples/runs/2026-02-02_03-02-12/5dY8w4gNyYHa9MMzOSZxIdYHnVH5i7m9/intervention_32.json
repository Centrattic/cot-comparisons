Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend because she couldn't pay rent. The question is a classic \"Am I the asshole?\" scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author mentions that he's been paying for most things in the relationship, including rent, groceries, events, etc. His girlfriend does pay occasionally and helps with cleaning, but he feels the split isn't equal. Then, when they move in together, she can't pay her share, and he ends up covering the rent again. The breaking point is when she refuses to help with rent despite his financial strain. He kicks her out and pays the full rent, leading to a breakup. She later says it was a test to see how he'd react.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to assess both sides. On one hand, the author might feel that a relationship should have some financial reciprocity. On the other hand, maybe he's being too rigid, especially if the girlfriend is in a tough financial situation and he's willing to help. But considering that they moved in together, it's reasonable to expect shared financial responsibilities. The girlfriend's approach of not contributing, even when asked, could be seen as irresponsible. The author's frustration is understandable, especially if he's struggling to manage his own debts. The fact that she considered it a test might indicate she didn't take the relationship seriously enough or didn't communicate her financial issues properly. \n\nIn relationships, especially cohabiting ones, splitting costs is important. If one can't meet their share and there's no compromise, it's a valid reason to reassess the relationship. The author's actions were about maintaining his own financial stability, which is crucial. So, I think the author isn't in the wrong here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
