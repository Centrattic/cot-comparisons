Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author broke up with their girlfriend and kicked her out because she couldn't pay rent. The girlfriend moved in with the author, and initially, they split the rent, but then she stopped contributing due to her own debts. The author ended up paying the full rent, which caused financial strain for them. The girlfriend seems to expect the author to take care of her financially, and when confronted, she justified it by saying it was a test. The author thinks they're not in the wrong, but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider financial responsibilities in a relationship. The author mentions that they believed the guy should pay for most things, but there should be some give and take. The girlfriend, on the other hand, seems to have a different view, expecting the guy to pay everything. When they moved in together, splitting rent is standard, so the girlfriend's refusal to contribute is a problem. The author is left covering the full rent, which is causing them financial stress. \n\nThe key points here are mutual responsibility and communication. When two people live together, especially in a committed relationship, it's usually expected that both contribute to shared expenses. The girlfriend's inability or unwillingness to pay her share, despite the author's financial strain, is a significant issue. The author tried to work with her, allowing her to pay a few hundred when she could, but she didn't follow through. The girlfriend's justification of it being a test doesn't help either, as financial responsibilities should be handled with transparency and honesty, not as a test.\n\nAnother aspect is the author's decision to kick her out after she refused to help with rent. The author had already been covering everything and couldn't afford it anymore. While splitting responsibilities is ideal, the girlfriend's repeated failure to contribute, even when she could, is a valid reason for the author to set boundaries. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own financial stability. People should be able to rely on each other in a relationship, but if one person consistently fails to meet their obligations, it's reasonable to step back.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if the author handled it correctly. Breaking up and removing someone from the apartment can be a drastic step, but given the circumstances, it's a decision based on financial necessity. The author might have tried to communicate better earlier on instead of waiting until the situation escalated. But overall, the main issue is the girlfriend's behavior and lack of contribution, which the author can't be blamed for. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. The responsibility for splitting bills when living together is mutual, and the girlfriend's refusal to contribute, especially when the author is struggling, justifies the author's actions. The correct answer is B.\n"
