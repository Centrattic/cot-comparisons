Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up and kicking the girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that from the start, he paid for most things, and she contributed occasionally. He didn't mind paying for most, but there was a lack of balance. When they moved in together, they split the rent initially, but she stopped contributing. He paid the full rent despite his own financial issues, and now she's again not contributing. He kicked her out because he felt it was unfair, and she said it was a test. He's wondering if he overreacted.\n\nSo, the key points here are financial responsibility in a relationship. The question is whether it's acceptable to end the relationship and kick someone out because they can't pay rent. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author is responsible for his own finances. If the partner isn't contributing to shared expenses, it's reasonable to expect some form of contribution, especially if they're living together. The author might feel that the relationship became financially one-sided, leading to stress and imbalance. Kicking her out could be seen as him taking control of his own financial situation, which is a valid decision.\n\nOn the other hand, relationships often involve compromises, and financial struggles can happen. The author might have handled it differently, like discussing budgeting or support for her debts instead of ending things abruptly. However, the girlfriend's attitude, where she expects the partner to cover everything without reciprocation, could be problematic. The author's decision to end the relationship might be justified if the financial strain was unbearable.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is also important. If she was in debt and couldn't pay rent, maybe there was a lack of communication about how they would handle such situations. Her testing his reaction by not paying might have been a bad move, but it's unclear if that was manipulative or just a lack of understanding.\n\nLegally, kicking someone out without proper procedures could be an issue, but the scenario seems more about mutual agreement to break up. The emotional aspect is complex\u2014financial stress can lead to relationship breakdowns. The author's frustration is understandable, especially if he's sacrificing his own financial stability to support her needs without mutual effort.\n\nIn terms of fairness, relationships require mutual support. If one partner consistently takes without giving back, the other has the right to reassess the relationship. The author's actions might be seen as protecting his own interests, which is not inherently wrong. However, if the breakup was impulsive without considering other solutions, that could be a point against him. But given the context of repeated financial strain and lack of reciprocity, his decision might be justified.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer would likely be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong. He's standing up for his financial responsibilities and setting boundaries in a one-sided relationship.\n"
