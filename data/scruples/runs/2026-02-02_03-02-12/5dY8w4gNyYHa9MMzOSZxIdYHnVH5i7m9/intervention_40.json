Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's look at this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, the relationship dynamics: the author mentions he was paying for most things, including rent, groceries, etc., and felt the contributions were unequal. The girlfriend moved in, and initially, they split the rent. However, she started missing payments, leading to the author having to cover everything. The final straw was her not paying rent again and expecting him to cover it without any reciprocity.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibilities and communication. The author felt it was unfair to bear all the costs, especially as he had his own financial obligations. When the girlfriend couldn't or refused to pay, the author decided to end the relationship. The girlfriend's claim that it was a test for how he'd react in a tough situation seems dismissive of the author's real financial strain.\n\nConsidering financial responsibility in a relationship, it's generally expected that both partners contribute to shared living costs. If one partner consistently fails to meet their share, it can lead to significant strain. The author's frustration is valid because he's shouldering more than his fair share, leading to his own financial instability. The girlfriend's lack of effort to pay her part and her dismissive attitude (\"why do I have a boyfriend then?\") shows a lack of consideration for the author's situation.\n\nThe author's decision to end the relationship seems like a response to protect his own financial well-being. Since the girlfriend wasn't improving her contributions and was testing his patience, the breakup might be justified as a necessary step. The girlfriend's behavior indicates a pattern of expecting the author to handle everything, which isn't sustainable or fair. \n\nHowever, one might argue that the author could have handled the situation differently, like setting clearer boundaries earlier or seeking a compromise. But given the circumstances where the girlfriend repeatedly failed to meet her responsibilities, the author's actions are understandable. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for his own needs and financial stability. The girlfriend's approach was arguably more problematic because she wasn't contributing her fair share and was testing the author's limits without considering the consequences for him.\n"
