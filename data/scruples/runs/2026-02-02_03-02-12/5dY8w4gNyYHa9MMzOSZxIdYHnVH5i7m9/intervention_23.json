Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a breakup where the author kicked his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The author mentions that he and his girlfriend moved in together, and she expected him to pay for everything, including rent. Over time, she started not contributing, even though he was paying for most things. When they moved in together, she couldn't pay rent due to her debts, so he covered it. Now, she's asking again, but he can't keep doing that and told her to leave. She claims it was a test to see his reaction.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. The key points here are mutual responsibility in a relationship, financial contributions, and clear communication. In a healthy relationship, both partners should contribute to shared expenses, even if one traditionally pays more. The author tried paying for things initially but felt it wasn't equal. When they moved in together, splitting rent is standard, but she couldn't contribute, leading to him taking on more financial burden. \n\nBreaking up because of financial disagreements is a personal choice, but the author's actions here seem to stem from feeling taken advantage of. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong. The girlfriend's refusal to pay rent, despite his financial strain, is a significant issue. The author's decision to end the relationship might be seen as a last resort after her consistent financial irresponsibility. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that he could have communicated his financial concerns earlier or sought a compromise. But given the timeline and the fact that she kept not contributing, his actions might be justified. Also, her statement that it was a test is problematic because it implies she used the situation to see his behavior without considering his financial stress.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. He took responsibility for his part by paying for things initially but had boundaries that were repeatedly crossed. The final action of asking her to leave was due to her inability to meet her financial obligations, which is a valid reason for ending the relationship.\n"
