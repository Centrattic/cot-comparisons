Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend moved in and wasn't paying her share. The author mentions that she had a mindset where the guy should pay for everything, and he went along with it. They moved in together, split rent initially, but then she stopped contributing. The author paid the full rent twice, which caused him financial strain. When she said she couldn't pay again, he kicked her out.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. Financial responsibility in relationships is a big deal. If both people are supposed to contribute to shared expenses, not doing so can create a lot of tension. The author seems to have set a boundary when she kept not paying, which led to the breakup. \n\nThe girlfriend's reasoning that the guy should pay everything might not be healthy in a partnership. The author was trying to balance things, but when her financial situation affected their shared living costs, he had to make a choice. Kicking her out was a drastic move, but maybe he felt it was necessary to protect his own finances.\n\nHowever, breaking up over this might be seen as harsh. But considering the ongoing financial issues and her lack of contribution, maybe it's understandable. The final trigger was her saying it was a test, which shows a lack of responsibility. The author probably felt he couldn't rely on her, so he ended the relationship to avoid further problems. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author might not be in the wrong if they had agreed to split the rent and she wasn't contributing. However, handling it by abruptly kicking her out could be seen as harsh. But given the circumstances, maybe it's a necessary step he took to protect himself financially. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because he's standing up for his own financial stability.\n"
