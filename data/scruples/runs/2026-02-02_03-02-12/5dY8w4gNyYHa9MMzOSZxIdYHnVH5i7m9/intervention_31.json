Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is at fault for breaking up with his girlfriend because she couldn't pay rent. The key points here are the financial responsibilities in their relationship and how they handled moving in together.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the girlfriend expects him to pay for most things, including rent after they move in together. She's had six months where she didn't pay rent, and then when they start splitting it, she can't contribute. The author paid the full rent twice because of her financial issues, which is causing him financial strain. He's upset because he feels he's shouldering all the costs, and when confronted, she responds with \"why do I have a boyfriend then?\" \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the right, but wants to know my take. I need to consider relationship norms and expectations. In many relationships, it's common to split expenses, but there's flexibility based on individual circumstances. However, when one partner can't contribute and the other is taking on the full burden, it can lead to resentment and conflict. \n\nThe girlfriend's attitude seems to be that the guy should cover everything, which might not be sustainable if her financial situation doesn't improve. The author tried to compromise but eventually felt it was unfair. The fact that she called it a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation (like an accident) is interesting. The author disagrees, thinking that's different from ongoing debt issues. \n\nLegally, if they were in a lease together, both are responsible for the rent. If she's not paying, he could be liable for the full amount, which he's doing, but that's causing him financial stress. Emotionally, the author felt it was necessary to end the relationship because of the imbalance. The question is whether his reaction was justified.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions seem reasonable. He communicated his concerns, tried to find solutions, and when that failed, made a decision to protect his own financial well-being. The girlfriend's lack of accountability and her dismissive attitude (\"why do I have a boyfriend\") likely contributed to the breakdown. So, I think the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
