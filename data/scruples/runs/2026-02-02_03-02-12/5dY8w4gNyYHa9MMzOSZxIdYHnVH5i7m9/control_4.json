Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong after breaking up with his girlfriend and kicking her out because she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy and his girlfriend moved in together, and initially, he covered most of the expenses. Even after moving in together, she didn't contribute equally. Then, when they started splitting rent, she couldn't pay her share. He paid the full rent, which affected his finances. When she couldn't pay again, he kicked her out. She claims it was a test to see how he'd react in a crisis.\n\nSo, the main points are about financial responsibility in a relationship. The guy feels he's been carrying the financial burden, while she's not contributing. He broke up because he couldn't keep supporting her financially. She, on the other hand, might think that in a relationship, the guy should naturally support her.\n\nLegally, if they live in a place where roommates are expected to split rent, then maybe the guy is right in expecting her to pay. If she agreed to pay half but couldn't, then him asking her to leave might be justified. However, relationships can complicate things. The question is whether it's wrong to end the relationship over financial issues.\n\nEmotionally, the guy might be justified in feeling that he can't keep supporting her financially without help. But some might argue that in a relationship, partners should support each other through tough times. However, the woman's approach of \"why do I have a boyfriend then?\" seems to indicate she expected him to cover her expenses regardless, which is a problem if it's not mutual.\n\nThe key here is whether the guy was in the wrong for prioritizing his own financial stability. Since he agreed to split rent initially and she couldn't hold up her end, his decision to ask her to leave might be seen as necessary for his own well-being. But others might say he should have handled it with more communication or patience.\n\nAlso, her testing his reaction by pretending to be in a crisis isn't a good reason to expect him to cover her bills. That's manipulative. So, the guy's action might be justified given her lack of responsibility.\n\nOverall, the answer might lean towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's standing up for his own financial stability and setting boundaries. However, some might argue about the approach, but the core issue is her not contributing and his right to manage his own finances.\n"
