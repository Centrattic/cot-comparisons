Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend and kicking her out because she couldn't pay rent. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nFirst, the timeline: They started dating, and the guy paid for most things, which the girlfriend didn't mind. She sometimes paid for things and cleaned, but the guy felt it wasn't equal. Then they moved in together in June 2018, and she didn't pay rent or bills for six months. When they moved in together more formally, she agreed to split the rent but later couldn't pay. The guy paid the full rent, which put him in a tough spot financially. Now she's not helping again, and she claims that's why she's with him\u2014to support her financially. The guy kicks her out, and she says it was a test.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong and wants to know if I agree. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nSo, evaluating this from different angles. Legally, if they were in a lease together, the guy might be responsible for the entire rent no matter what. But since the girlfriend wasn't paying, he's stuck. Morally, does the man have the right to expect financial equality in a relationship? The girlfriend seems to have a different expectation: the guy should pay for everything, which he was okay with initially, but she wasn't contributing. When they moved in together, splitting rent is usually expected, so her not paying could be seen as unfair. However, the girl might feel she's contributing in other ways like cleaning. \n\nThe breaking point was when she couldn't pay again and said it was a test. The author's reaction was to kick her out, which is understandable given the financial strain. But was that overreacting? Some might say yes, that relationships require flexibility, but others might agree that expecting one person to cover all expenses is unreasonable. Also, the girlfriend's justification that it's a test (for emergencies like accidents) is a stretch, because that's not the same as ongoing debt issues. \n\nSo, factors to consider: the initial agreement on finances, whether there was communication, and the fairness of the situation. The guy did try to communicate and compromise but felt it was one-sided. The girlfriend's attitude of expecting the guy to support her financially without reciprocity might be the root issue. The author's decision to end things could be seen as standing up for his own financial well-being. \n\nHowever, some might argue that relationships should handle such issues through discussion and support rather than splitting. But since the girlfriend wasn't willing to help and was treating it as a test, maybe the author was right to end it. \n\nIn conclusion, the author likely isn't in the wrong because he's protecting his financial stability, which is important. The girlfriend's approach was unsustainable and one-sided, so the author's actions were justified. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
