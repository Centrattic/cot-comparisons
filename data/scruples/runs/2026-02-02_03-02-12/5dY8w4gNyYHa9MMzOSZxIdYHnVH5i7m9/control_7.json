Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent.\n\nFirst, the key points: The couple moved in together, split rent initially. The girlfriend couldn't pay rent due to her debts, and the author paid the full amount. This happened again, and the author decided to end the relationship and kick her out. The girlfriend later said it was a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's been paying for most things, she didn't contribute equally, and when she couldn't pay rent, he felt it was unfair. He's in a financial bind now. The girlfriend's defense is that she wanted to test his response to a crisis.\n\nI need to assess if the author overreacted. Financial responsibilities in a relationship are a common issue. The author expected some give and take but felt it was unequal. When she couldn't pay, he took a firm stance. The girlfriend's attitude that the guy should pay everything without her contribution is a red flag. Also, her \"test\" explanation seems manipulative.\n\nBut maybe the author could have handled it differently, like setting clearer boundaries earlier. However, the situation escalated to the point where he had to make a tough choice. Financial stability is important, and he's prioritizing his own needs now. While the breakup was harsh, the underlying issues were probably long-standing. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
