Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who broke up with their girlfriend because she couldn't pay rent is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author mentions that the girlfriend moved into his apartment, and initially, he covered most expenses, expecting some reciprocity. They moved in together, split the rent for a while, but then she stopped paying her share due to her own financial issues. The author paid the full rent, which strained his finances, and when she again couldn't pay, he kicked her out. She later said it was a test to see his reaction to a tough situation, like an accident.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are financial responsibility in a relationship and mutual agreement on shared expenses. In a shared living situation, splitting bills is typically expected unless there's a prior agreement otherwise. The author's frustration is understandable if he's shouldering all the costs, especially when he was already in a precarious financial situation. The girlfriend's actions\u2014relying on him to cover her share without contributing\u2014could be seen as irresponsible, especially since she had the option to pay a small amount but didn't. \n\nHowever, breaking up and evicting someone can be a drastic measure. The author might be overreacting if the girlfriend was honest about her financial struggles and they couldn't find a compromise. But the girlfriend's lack of effort to contribute, even after being asked, and her dismissing the situation as a test might justify the author's decision. \n\nFinancial obligations in relationships can be tricky. If both parties weren't transparent about their financial expectations from the beginning, miscommunication could lead to conflict. The author may have felt it was necessary to prioritize his own financial stability, especially if he was already in debt. On the other hand, relationships require teamwork, and expecting one person to handle all financial burdens could strain the relationship. \n\nThe girlfriend's comment about it being a test is problematic. Using someone's financial sacrifices as a test without considering their own responsibilities isn't fair. The author's decision to end the relationship might be a result of feeling taken advantage of, which isn't uncommon in such situations. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's actions could be seen as harsh, given the girlfriend's lack of contribution and her dismissive attitude, it's reasonable to argue that he acted in his own financial self-interest. The fault isn't entirely on one side, but the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
