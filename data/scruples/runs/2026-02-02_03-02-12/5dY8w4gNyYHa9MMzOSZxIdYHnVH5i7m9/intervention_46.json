Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend and kicking her out because she couldn't pay rent.\n\nFirst, looking at the situation: The couple moved in together, and initially split the rent. The girlfriend then stopped paying her share due to her own debts. The author ended up paying the full rent, which put him in a tough financial spot. He tried to get her to pay back, but she refused, leading to the breakup.\n\nThe key points here are about financial responsibility and expectations in a relationship. The author believed in the guy paying most, but wanted some give and take. The girlfriend, on the other hand, expected the guy to cover everything. When she couldn't pay her part, the author felt it was unfair and decided to end the relationship. \n\nFinancial issues are a common source of conflict in relationships. The girlfriend's inability to meet her financial obligations, especially after agreeing to split the rent, could be seen as a breach of trust. The author had to cover the rent, which caused him financial strain, and when he asked for repayment or shared responsibility, she didn't comply. His reaction was to kick her out, which he feels is justified given the circumstances.\n\nThe girlfriend's justification that she was testing his reaction to her hypothetical financial issues (like an accident) doesn't hold up because the situation is real and recurring. Tests in relationships shouldn't be about putting the other person in financial hardship. \n\nThe author's actions, while harsh, stem from a place of needing to manage his own finances responsibly. It's important to note that while relationships should have support, there's a limit to how much one person should bear the burden, especially without mutual effort.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He made a tough decision to protect his financial stability and set boundaries when mutual support wasn't happening. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
