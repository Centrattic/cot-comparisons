We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author, an 18-year-old female, is in a one-and-a-half-month relationship with a 19-year-old boyfriend. He mentioned having anger issues, but she didn't think much of it since she used to be angry too. The incident happened when she tapped him on the leg playfully, and he reacted by throwing iced tea at her face. She was upset, left, and told him he needed to get therapy or she would leave. Now she's questioning if she was too pushy.\n\nFirst, I should consider what constitutes healthy communication in a relationship. The author confronted the boyfriend about his actions, which led to an apology and a promise to get help. Setting boundaries is important, especially when there's a potential for abusive behavior. Anger issues, especially if they involve physical aggression, can be a red flag. The fact that he reacted so strongly to a playful tap might indicate a problem, even if it didn't result in serious injury.\n\nThe author's approach was direct, which can be valid when safety is a concern. She gave him an option to seek help or the relationship ends. That's a firm stance, but it's about self-respect and safety. However, some might argue that giving an ultimatum so soon in the relationship could be harsh. But considering the nature of his reaction, it's a valid concern for her well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe she could have encouraged therapy without making it an absolute requirement. But given that the incident was a clear escalation of his previously mentioned anger issues, her reaction might be justified. It's important to prioritize one's safety and emotional health.\n\nThe boyfriend's immediate regret and apology are positive, but the action itself is concerning. The author isn't wrong for holding him accountable. In relationships, especially when there's a history of anger issues, addressing such behavior is crucial. So, the answer here is likely B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
