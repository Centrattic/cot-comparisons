We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the person writing the story) is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend that he either gets therapy or she leaves. The situation is that the boyfriend, who has mentioned anger issues, threw a cup of tea at her after she tapped him. She told him he needs therapy or she's leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The boyfriend is 19, the author is 18. They've been together a month and a half. He mentioned his anger issues before, so she was aware. The incident happened when she tapped him playfully, then he reacted with throwing tea. She's telling him to get help or break up. \n\nThe key points here are: 1) He had prior warnings about anger issues, 2) The action was violent and unexpected, 3) She's setting a boundary for his behavior. \n\nSetting boundaries is important in relationships. If someone has known issues, and their actions cross a line, it's reasonable to expect them to seek help. The author isn't asking for something unreasonable; therapy is a common and healthy step for anger management. \n\nBut maybe someone could argue that she's being too quick to end the relationship. However, considering he had a history of anger and this was a physical act of aggression, even if it was with a plastic cup, it's a red flag. The author is prioritizing her safety and well-being, which is valid. \n\nIs there a better way to handle it? Maybe discussing it more calmly, but in the heat of the moment, her reaction is understandable. She's not being pushy; she's setting clear terms for the relationship's continuation. \n\nSo the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
