We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after telling her boyfriend that he needs to get therapy for his anger issues or she'll leave. \n\nFirst, looking at the situation: the boyfriend has mentioned his anger problems before, and the author knew he had them but didn't see red flags. Then, in this incident, he threw a cup of tea at her after a light tap. The author was upset and decided to set a boundary\u2014either get help or she leaves. She followed through by leaving.\n\nSo, the key points here are: \n\n1. The boyfriend had a history of anger issues, which he admitted.\n2. The incident was a physical reaction (throwing a cup) in response to a minor provocation (a foot tap).\n3. The author set a clear boundary after the incident, which the boyfriend agreed to.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics of healthy relationships, setting boundaries around harmful behavior is usually advised. The author isn't escalating the situation beyond the actual incident. She's acknowledging his past statements but taking action when the behavior becomes harmful. The boyfriend's reaction was unprovoked and potentially harmful, even if not physically damaging. \n\nSome might argue that the author was too quick to end things, but given the context of his admitted anger issues and the immediate reaction, it's a reasonable step. Therapy is a common recommendation for anger management, so the author's demand for that is practical. \n\nHowever, others might say that pushing for immediate therapy could be seen as controlling. But in this case, the author is prioritizing her safety and setting a boundary after a specific incident. The boyfriend did apologize and agreed to get help, which suggests he acknowledged the problem. \n\nI think the author is in the right here. She's not being pushy; she's setting necessary boundaries after a concerning action. The boyfriend's behavior, while not violent in the traditional sense, still shows a lack of control and respect. The author's response is about self-respect and safety. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
