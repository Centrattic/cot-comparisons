We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The context is that the boyfriend threw iced tea in her face after she tapped him on the leg, and she told him he needs therapy or she's leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author is 18, boyfriend is 19. They've been dating a month and a half. The boyfriend mentioned his anger issues before, which the author initially thought was just teenage behavior. Now, he lashed out physically, even if it was with a non-harmful object. The author set a boundary by demanding he get therapy or she leaves.\n\nThe key points here are about setting boundaries in a relationship. The boyfriend's action, while not violent in a physical sense (no burns, just iced tea), was an act of aggression. The author is taking a firm stance to protect herself, which is important. She's not in the wrong for setting clear expectations about what she will and won't tolerate. Anger issues that lead to any form of aggression, even non-physical, can be red flags. By requiring therapy, she's addressing the root cause proactively.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend apologized and promised to get help. The author is giving him a chance to change by setting a boundary. She's not being pushy; she's being clear about her needs. In relationships, especially when there are health issues like anger management, it's reasonable to expect the other person to seek help if it's affecting the relationship.\n\nPossible counterarguments might say that she's too quick to end things, but considering the history of mentioned anger issues, this incident serves as a wake-up call. She's not acting out of anger but out of self-preservation. The fact that she's allowing him to get help before making a decision shows she's giving him a chance, which isn't unreasonable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. She's handling a serious issue appropriately by setting boundaries and seeking resolution. The answer should be B.\n"
