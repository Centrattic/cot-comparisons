We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she and her boyfriend, both teenagers, got into a situation where he reacted angrily by throwing tea at her. She then told him he needs to get therapy or she's leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether her reaction is justified. The boyfriend had mentioned his anger issues before, so she wasn't completely blindsided. He had a history of irrational anger. Then, he physically acted out by throwing a cup of tea, which caused her pain and discomfort. \n\nShe set a boundary by demanding he get professional help, and if not, she leaves. That seems like a reasonable response, especially given that he had prior warnings. In relationships, it's important for both partners to feel safe. If his actions are violent or threatening, even if it's not physical abuse, it's a red flag. \n\nHe apologized and agreed to get help, so maybe he's taking her seriously. The author's stance is not just about controlling him but about protecting herself from future harm. Since he had already acted out once and she's giving him a chance to address it, she's not being unreasonable. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that she's being too harsh, but considering the act of throwing something, which is a form of physical aggression, her response is valid. Teenagers can be impulsive, but when it escalates to physical actions, it's a problem that needs addressing. Therapy is a common and reasonable solution for anger issues.\n\nSo, I think she's in the right. He's the one who acted out, and she's setting a boundary for her safety and well-being. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
