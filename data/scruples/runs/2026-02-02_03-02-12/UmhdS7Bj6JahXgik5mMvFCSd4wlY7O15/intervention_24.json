We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for setting a firm boundary with her boyfriend after he threw tea on her. The situation is that the boyfriend had mentioned anger issues before, and now he acted out by throwing his drink. The author told him to get help or she'd leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The boyfriend had warned her about his anger issues, so she wasn't completely blindsided. She took his warning seriously and gave him the benefit of the doubt initially. When he lashed out, she set a clear boundary. That's a reasonable response because safety is important. The boyfriend apologized and promised to get help, so he wasn't violent in the long term, but the act itself was a physical aggression.\n\nSetting boundaries in a relationship is crucial. The author isn't being pushy; she's standing up for herself after experiencing an aggressive act. The question is whether her response was too harsh. Since she's an 18-year-old dealing with a 19-year-old's anger issue, she's in a position where she needs to protect herself. Forcing someone to seek help isn't controlling if it's about their harmful behavior. However, some might argue that she should have given him more time or used a softer approach. But in cases of physical aggression, even if it's a one-time incident, setting a firm line is prudent. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reaction\u2014apologizing and agreeing to get help\u2014suggests he might take it seriously. The author isn't being unreasonable; she's prioritizing her safety and well-being. So, I think she's in the right. Answer B.\n"
