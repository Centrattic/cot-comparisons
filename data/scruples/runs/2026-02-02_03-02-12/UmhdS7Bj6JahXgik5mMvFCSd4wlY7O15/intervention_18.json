We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is an 18-year-old girl with a 19-year-old boyfriend. They've been together about a month and a half. The boyfriend mentioned he gets irrationally angry, but the author thought it was just teenage behavior. Then, during a walk, she tapped his leg with her foot as a quip, and he threw his iced tea cup at her face. She was angry, left his place, and told him he needed to get therapy for his anger issues or she was leaving. He apologized and said he'd get help. She's now asking if she was too pushy.\n\nFirst, the action of throwing a cup of tea. That's not just a minor thing. Even if it was iced, it could have caused harm. The boyfriend had prior mentions of anger issues, so the author was aware but might not have taken it seriously enough. When the incident happened, the author took a stand by setting a boundary. She gave him a choice: therapy or the relationship ends. \n\nIs that too pushy? Well, in a healthy relationship, both partners should be able to set boundaries. If someone's behavior is harmful, it's reasonable to expect them to address it. The author is protecting herself and making her limits clear. The boyfriend had control over his impulses and reacted violently. The author isn't in the wrong for holding him accountable. Teenage relationships can be volatile, but this is about safety. She's prioritizing her well-being, which is right. So the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
