We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend he needs therapy or she'll leave. The situation involves a teenager (19) and his 18-year-old girlfriend. They've been together a month and a half. The boyfriend had mentioned he gets irrationally angry, and the author used to be angry too, so she didn't mind.\n\nNow, the key incident: she tapped him on the leg playfully, he turned around and threw his tea cup at her face. She got hurt a bit and was angry. She left after that and told him he needs therapy or she's leaving. He apologized and agreed to get help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author didn't know he had such a strong reaction before. She asked him to get help because he had a moment where he acted out in anger, even though he later apologized. The boyfriend's action of throwing a cup at her face is a clear physical aggression, even if it's not severe. The author is setting a boundary, which is important in any relationship. \n\nSetting boundaries is healthy. The boyfriend had previously mentioned anger issues, so she's aware of it but maybe didn't realize the potential danger. The act of throwing a cup, even a plastic one, can be seen as an act of anger that could escalate. The author is taking a responsible step by requiring him to seek professional help, which is a reasonable way to address underlying issues.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction here is immediate and unprovoked. The quip and tap might have been a minor trigger, but the response was disproportionate. The author is not being pushy by asking for a solution that can prevent future incidents. Therapy is a common and recommended approach for managing anger issues. \n\nIs the author being too harsh? Maybe not. She's in a new relationship, and acting out in anger like this is a red flag. She's not giving him a chance to repeat the behavior, which is understandable. She's also being clear about her expectations for the relationship moving forward. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say she should have given him more time or tried to resolve it without therapy. But given the sudden escalation and the fact that he admitted he reacted without thinking and then apologized, seeking professional help is a proactive step. Also, as a teenager, he's still developing emotional regulation, so therapy can be beneficial.\n\nAnother point is that she's in a position to set her boundaries. It's her right to decide what she can tolerate in a relationship. If he's committed to change, then her request is valid. If he doesn't follow through, she's leaving, which shows she's serious about her well-being.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. She's addressing a harmful behavior and taking steps to ensure her safety and the health of the relationship. The answer should be B.\n"
