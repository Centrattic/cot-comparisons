We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend to get therapy or leave after he threw a cup of tea at her. The situation is a bit complex because it's a young couple, both teenagers, and there's a history of him mentioning anger issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend had warned her about his anger before, so she wasn't completely blindsided. He reacted in a way that physically harmed her, even if it was with a plastic cup. The act of throwing tea in her face is a clear act of aggression, even if he said it was an impulsive reaction. The author stood up for herself, set a boundary, and left, which seems reasonable.\n\nNow, the author's response was to demand therapy or leave. Is that too harsh? Well, she's setting a boundary based on his previous warning and the actual incident. If he had a history of anger issues and demonstrated it again without any prior red flags, it's understandable she wants him to seek help. The question is about whether being firm like that is wrong.\n\nIn relationships, especially when there's a pattern of behavior that causes harm, setting clear boundaries is healthy. The author's approach might seem \"my way or the highway,\" but it's important to consider that she's prioritizing her safety and well-being. Teenagers might not handle these situations as maturely, but she's taking a proactive step to address a serious issue.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that she didn't give him enough time to change or that her demand was too abrupt. But given the immediate threat and the fact that he had already apologized and promised to get help, her decision to leave seems justified. She's not in the wrong for enforcing her limits after he breached them.\n\nSo, the answer is B: No, the author is not in the wrong. She's taking responsibility for her own safety and addressing a potential red flag early on.\n"
