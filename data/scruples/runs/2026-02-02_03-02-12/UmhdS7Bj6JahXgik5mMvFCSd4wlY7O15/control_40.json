We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the boyfriend threw iced tea on her when she tapped him, and the author told him he needs therapy or she's leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The key points are:\n\n1. The boyfriend had previously mentioned anger issues. The author thought it was manageable, maybe typical for a teenager. \n2. The incident where he lashed out by throwing the cup of tea. It was impulsive, and he apologized later. \n3. The author set a boundary: therapy or she leaves. He agreed.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. Anger that leads to physical aggression, even if not violent, can be a red flag. Throwing a beverage isn't physical violence, but it's a sudden reaction that caused harm. The author recognized this as a problem and set a boundary. \n\nIn relationships, setting boundaries is healthy. The author didn't confront the issue passively; she addressed it directly and clearly. The boyfriend agreed to get help, so she's not being unreasonable. Some might argue that she's being too strict, but given the potential for recurring issues, ensuring he gets help is responsible. \n\nAlso, considering they're both young, handling anger can be a significant issue. The author's decision to require therapy is proactive. The boyfriend's reaction was unprovoked and escalated quickly. The author's stance is about safety and respect in the relationship. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's taking responsibility for her safety and the health of the relationship. Answer B.\n"
