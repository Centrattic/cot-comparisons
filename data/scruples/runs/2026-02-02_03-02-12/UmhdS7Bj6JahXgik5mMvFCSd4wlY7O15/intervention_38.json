We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend to get therapy or she'll leave. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The boyfriend, who's 19, threw a cup of iced tea at her after she tapped him on the leg. He said he has anger issues and it was an impulsive reaction. She responded by giving him an ultimatum: therapy or she leaves. She's 18, so both are young.\n\nNow, considering red flags. Throwing something, even if it's just a cup of tea, is a form of physical aggression. Even though it's not severe, it's a clear sign of anger issues. The boyfriend had mentioned it before, so the author wasn't blindsided. She decided to set a boundary, which is setting a limit on his behavior. \n\nIs she being too pushy? Well, she's communicating her needs and safety. At 18, she's still learning about relationships, but setting boundaries is healthy. Therapy is a reasonable request when there are signs of anger management problems. The boyfriend apologized and agreed to get help, so maybe he's open to it.\n\nCould there be a better way? Maybe, but her approach is direct and clear. She's not in the wrong for prioritizing her safety and well-being. The question is whether her response is justified. Given the context, she's not overreacting. She's addressing a red flag early on, which is proactive.\n\nSo the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
