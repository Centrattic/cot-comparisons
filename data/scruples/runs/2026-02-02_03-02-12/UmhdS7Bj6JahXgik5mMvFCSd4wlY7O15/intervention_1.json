We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend to get therapy or leave. The situation involves the boyfriend throwing a cup of iced tea at her after she tapped him. The key points here are the boyfriend's reaction, the author's response, and the context of their relationship.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend mentioned having anger issues before, which the author was aware of but didn't see red flags. However, this incident escalated when he physically reacted to her light tap. Even though it was a plastic cup with iced tea, the act of throwing it at someone's face is aggressive and could be considered a form of physical aggression, albeit non-lethal. The author was hurt and shocked, leading her to set a boundary by demanding therapy or breakup.\n\nNow, considering the author's actions: she clearly communicated her needs and boundaries. In relationships, especially with someone who has admitted to anger issues, setting a limit is crucial for safety and respect. The boyfriend's reaction was uncontrolled and immediate, which the author rightfully recognized as a problem. Her insistence on therapy is a reasonable step to address the underlying issue, not just a reaction to this one incident. She didn't give an ultimatum without prior context\u2014she had been aware of his struggles and this was a concrete example of how they manifested.\n\nSome might argue that she's being too controlling, but given the potential for future harm, her decision is proactive. The boyfriend's own admission of regret and willingness to get help suggests he understands the severity. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her well-being and setting clear expectations. Therapy is a standard and healthy approach to managing anger, so her stance is justified.\n"
