We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the girl) is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend he needs to get therapy or she'll leave. The situation is that he threw a cup of tea at her after she tapped him. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. Both are young, 18 and 19, been together a month and a half. The boyfriend mentioned he gets irrationally angry, but the girl had her own anger issues in the past. The key event is the tea being thrown. She reacted by saying he needs therapy or she's leaving.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong for setting that boundary. The options are A (yes, she's wrong) or B (no, she's not). \n\nI need to consider if her reaction is disproportionate. The boyfriend reacted impulsively, which he apologized for. The girl set a clear boundary for his behavior. In relationships, it's important to address abusive or hurtful behavior. Throwing a drink is a form of physical aggression, even if it's not violent. \n\nThe girl is taking responsibility by setting a boundary, which is a reasonable response to protect herself. She's not in the wrong for expecting her partner to seek help for anger management. Pushing for therapy isn't pushy if the behavior is harmful. \n\nAlso, considering their age, they might be inexperienced in handling conflicts. But her reaction is about safety and respect. The boyfriend's action, while not physically harmful, was intentional and could escalate. The girl's stance is about preventing future harm. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. She's setting necessary boundaries for her well-being. The boyfriend's actions, though regretted, are concerning, and her demand for therapy is a valid step.\n"
