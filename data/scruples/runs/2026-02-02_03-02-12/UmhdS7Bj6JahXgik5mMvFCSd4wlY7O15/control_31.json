We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the boyfriend threw iced tea at her when she tapped his leg, and she told him he has to get therapy or she's leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The boyfriend had mentioned anger issues before, but the author didn't take it seriously, thinking it was just teenage behavior. Then this incident happened. The boyfriend's reaction was sudden and aggressive\u2014throwing the cup and tea. The author then set a boundary, demanding therapy or she leaves.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author overstepped. Let's break it down. The author's actions: setting a condition for staying in the relationship. Was that too pushy? Well, in relationships, boundaries are important. If someone has a history of issues that could affect the relationship's safety, it's reasonable to set limits.\n\nBut maybe the author could have handled it differently. Like, perhaps discussing therapy as a suggestion rather than an ultimatum. But considering the incident involved physical aggression, even if minor, setting a firm boundary is understandable. The boyfriend admitted he reacted without registering the anger, which is concerning. Therapy is a valid step to address that.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the situation was overreacted to, but the author had a right to feel unsafe. The boyfriend's action was unexpected and aggressive, leading her to leave. Insisting on therapy to prevent future incidents is responsible.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. She's protecting herself and addressing a serious issue. The boyfriend's behavior, even if apologized for, needs professional help to avoid escalation. So the answer should be B.\n"
