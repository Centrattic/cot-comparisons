We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the boyfriend, who's 19, and the author, an 18-year-old girl, have been dating for a month and a half. The boyfriend mentioned he has anger issues, but the author didn't take it seriously, thinking maybe it's just typical teenage behavior.\n\nThen the incident happens: she taps him playfully on the leg, and he throws his iced tea cup at her face. The author is upset, leaves, and tells him he needs to get therapy for his anger or she's leaving. Now she's wondering if she was too pushy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend had warned about his anger issues, and the author didn't take it seriously. But when an actual incident occurs, she's reacting to protect herself. She set a boundary because she was hurt, even if it was iced tea. The key here is that she's trying to address a problem he's already acknowledged, so her setting a firm limit might be justified.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say she's being too harsh for a first incident, especially since he apologized and seemed remorseful. But given that he had mentioned the anger issues before, it's not like this was a surprise. The author is taking responsibility for her own safety and well-being, which is important in any relationship.\n\nAlso, considering their age, they're both young and might not have a lot of experience handling conflicts. The author's approach is direct, but maybe it's necessary when there's a pattern of behavior, even if it's just the first major incident. She's not being abusive; she's trying to communicate her needs and set boundaries.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's responding to a partner who already had known issues and is taking a stand to protect herself. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
