We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend throwing iced tea on her after she tapped him on the leg. She then told him he needed therapy or she's leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The boyfriend mentioned he has anger issues before. The author didn't think much of it initially, maybe dismissing it as teenage behavior. But when the incident happened, it was a clear act of aggression. Throwing a cup of tea, even if it's iced, is a physical reaction that could have been more hurtful. The author felt justified in setting a boundary because he didn't apologize until after she left, and she's making it clear that this behavior isn't acceptable. \n\nThe key points here are consent, respect, and safety in a relationship. If someone acts in a way that's harmful, even if it's accidental, it's important to address it. The author is taking a stand for her own safety and well-being, which is a valid approach. She's not just reacting in anger but setting a boundary for future behavior. \n\nIs she being too pushy? Maybe, but given the context of him having anger issues and the incident being a manifestation of that, her reaction is proportionate. Therapy is a reasonable step for someone with anger management problems. She's not just cutting him off without giving him a chance to address the issue; she's giving him a clear path to show his commitment to changing his behavior. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions were the problem, and she's taking responsibility for her own needs and safety. The answer should be B.\n"
