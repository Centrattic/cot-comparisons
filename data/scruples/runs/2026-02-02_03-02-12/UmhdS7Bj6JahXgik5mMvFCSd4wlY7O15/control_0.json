We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend he needs therapy or it's the highway. Let me go through the context again.\n\nFirst, they're both teenagers, 19 and 18, in a three-month relationship. The boyfriend mentioned he gets irrationally angry. The author used to be angry too but didn't mind since he hadn't shown violent tendencies. Then, after a minor joke where she tapped him with her foot, he threw a cup of iced tea at her face. She was upset, left, and told him he needs therapy or she's leaving. He apologized and agreed to get help. The author is wondering if she was too pushy.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are: the boyfriend had mentioned anger issues before, but the author didn't take it seriously until this incident. The action of throwing the cup was a physical reaction to a minor provocation. The author then sets a boundary requiring professional help. \n\nIn relationships, setting boundaries around harmful behavior is important. Even though they're young, the author is addressing a potential red flag. The boyfriend's action, while not physically injurious (since it was iced tea), was still an act of aggression. The author is holding him accountable for his actions, which could prevent future issues.\n\nBut is she being too pushy? Well, she's not forcing him into therapy but giving him a choice: address the problem or the relationship ends. It's a clear boundary. People in relationships often need to set such limits to protect themselves. The boyfriend seems to have acknowledged his mistake and agreed to get help. So the author isn't being inconsiderate; she's prioritizing her safety and well-being. \n\nOn the flip side, some might say she's overreacting because it's a first incident and they're young. But considering he admitted to having anger issues before, this could be a pattern. Addressing it early might prevent escalation. Therapy is a reasonable step. So, I think the author is in the right. She's protecting herself and addressing a valid concern.\n"
