We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the boyfriend, who mentioned he has anger issues, threw a cup of iced tea at her. She got mad, left, and told him he needs therapy or she's leaving for good.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The boyfriend had a history of anger issues, which he mentioned before. The author didn't think it was a big deal, maybe because she used to be angry herself and thought he was just a typical teenager. But when he threw the cup, it actually hurt her and got her upset. Then she set a boundary, saying he needs therapy or she's gone.\n\nThe question is, is she in the wrong for being so direct? Some might say she should have handled it more gently, given that they're young and maybe he's not used to dealing with emotions. Others might argue that if someone has anger issues and acts out in a harmful way, setting a firm boundary is necessary for her own safety and well-being. \n\nThe action of throwing the cup was physical, even if it was just an iced tea. It could be a form of emotional or even physical abuse. The author is taking a stand, which could be seen as responsible because she's prioritizing her own safety. However, someone might think she's being too harsh, especially since it's a new relationship and maybe it was a one-time incident. But the boyfriend himself admitted he reacts in anger and regretted it. So he's aware of his problem. \n\nThe author's response\u2014setting clear terms for therapy or leaving\u2014might be justified. It's important in a relationship to address harmful behaviors, and if the boyfriend is serious about his anger, seeking therapy is a reasonable step. She's not just jumping to conclusions but responding to an actual incident he's admitted to being a reaction.\n\nSo, considering the boyfriend's own admission of anger issues and the physical action towards her, the author's decision to set a boundary seems appropriate. She's not being pushy; she's protecting herself. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
