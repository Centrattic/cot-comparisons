We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend to get therapy or she'll leave. The situation is that the boyfriend had an outburst where he threw a cup of tea at her after she tapped him on the leg. The author then set a boundary that he needs to get help for his anger issues or she's leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They're both teenagers in a new relationship. The boyfriend had mentioned his anger issues before, so the author wasn't completely blindsided. He had a reaction that involved throwing a drink, which could have caused harm. The author felt hurt and set a clear boundary. \n\nSetting boundaries in relationships is important. Even if the boyfriend didn't intend to be violent, the action was reactive and could escalate. The author is prioritizing her safety and well-being by pushing him towards therapy. Pushing for help isn't being pushy; it's taking a stand against potential abuse. \n\nHowever, some might argue that she's overreacting because it was just a cup of tea and maybe he was just a teenager being impulsive. But given that he had a history of anger issues and the immediate reaction was to hit her with the cup, it's a valid concern. \n\nAlso, the author didn't just leave immediately but gave him a chance to apologize and commit to getting help. That shows she's open to resolving the issue but knows her limits. \n\nIn relationships, especially when there's a mention of past issues, it's crucial to address red flags early. Therapy is a reasonable step to address anger management. So, the author isn't in the wrong for setting that boundary. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
