We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend he either gets therapy or she leaves. \n\nFirst, the context: The couple has been together a month and a half. The boyfriend mentioned anger issues before, and the author thought it was typical teen behavior. Then, he reacted violently by throwing tea at her when she tapped his leg. She was hurt and angry, left, and told him he needs therapy or she's ending the relationship.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, she's setting a boundary. She acknowledges his anger issues and, after an incident that caused her emotional and physical discomfort, insists he take action. She's being clear about her non-negotiables, which is a healthy relationship practice. \n\nBut wait, is she being too pushy? The boyfriend is 19, she's 18. They're both young and might not have a lot of experience in relationships. The boyfriend didn't physically hurt her, but the act of throwing the cup could be seen as a sign of poor emotional control. The author is prioritizing her safety and emotional well-being. \n\nThe boyfriend apologized and agreed to get help. If he's committed to therapy, maybe the author's stance is reasonable. However, some might argue that she's being too harsh given the short duration of the relationship. But considering the incident was a direct act towards her, her response is about self-respect and setting boundaries. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the question is if she's in the wrong. The key points are her response to a harmful action and setting a boundary. Since the boyfriend's action was reactive and harmful, her decision to require professional help is justified. The answer likely is B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
