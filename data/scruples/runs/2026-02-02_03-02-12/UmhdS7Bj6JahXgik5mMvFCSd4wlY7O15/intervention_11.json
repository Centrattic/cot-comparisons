We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The boyfriend, 19, and the author, 18, have been dating for about 1.5 months. The boyfriend mentioned he gets irrationally angry, but she didn't think much of it. Now, he threw a cup of iced tea at her face when she tapped his leg. She was upset, left his place, and told him he needs to get therapy or she's out.\n\nSo, the key points here. The boyfriend had a history of anger issues, which he mentioned. The incident happened in a public setting (walking back after dinner), and the author was provoked by a tap on the leg. His reaction was throwing the cup, which caused physical discomfort and emotional distress. She set a boundary: therapy or she leaves. He agreed. \n\nNow, considering boundaries in relationships. It's important for both partners to respect each other's limits. The author felt unsafe after this incident. Physical aggression, even if not severe, can be a red flag. She's taking a stand for her safety and well-being. Her approach might seem harsh, but she's setting a clear boundary. \n\nIs she being too pushy? Well, she's not asking for a small change\u2014therapy is a significant step, but it's necessary if there's a history of anger. She's given him an ultimatum, which is a personal choice. However, some might argue that giving an ultimatum so quickly could be extreme, especially in a new relationship. But considering the incident, her reaction is justified. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was unprovoked aggression. Even if he apologized, the action itself is concerning. The author's decision to leave if he doesn't seek help is protecting herself. \n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong: the boyfriend acted inappropriately. The author's response is about enforcing her boundaries. So, I don't think she's in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
