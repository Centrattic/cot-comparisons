We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the story did the wrong thing. Let me read through the details carefully.\n\nThe situation is that the boyfriend threw iced tea at the author after she tapped him on the leg. He said he didn't realize his anger at first but then reacted. The author was upset and told him he needed therapy or she would leave. Now she's wondering if she was too pushy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They're both teenagers in a short-term relationship. The boyfriend had mentioned anger issues before, which the author knew about. The act of throwing a cup of tea, even if it's iced, is physically aggressive and could be seen as a form of emotional abuse or a red flag. The author setting a boundary for therapy is about ensuring her safety and well-being.\n\nIn relationships, especially when there's a history of anger issues, setting clear boundaries is important. The author isn't just being pushy; she's addressing a behavior that could escalate. The boyfriend's reaction was unprovoked and hurtful, so the author's demand for him to get help is reasonable. It's her right to prioritize her safety, even if it means ending the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that she could have handled it differently, like encouraging therapy without ultimatums. However, given that he already promised to get help and she feels strongly about it, her stance isn't unreasonable. She's taking a firm stand for herself, which is a healthy approach. The key here is that she's protecting herself from potential future harm, and that's not in her wrong.\n"
