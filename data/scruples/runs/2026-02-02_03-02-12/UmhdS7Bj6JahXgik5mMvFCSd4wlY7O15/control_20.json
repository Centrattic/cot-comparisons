We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend throwing a cup of tea at her, which she found out was due to his anger issues. She made him choose therapy or she would leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The boyfriend mentioned his anger issues before, and the author, who had her own past with anger, didn't mind. Then, during a walk, she tapped him with her foot, and he reacted by throwing the tea. She left, and told him he needed therapy or she was leaving. The question is whether she's in the wrong for being so firm.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, she's standing up for herself after an incident that hurt her physically and emotionally. She's setting boundaries, which is important in any relationship. The boyfriend had prior warnings about his anger, and this incident was a direct example of that. By insisting he get help, she's trying to prevent future harm. That seems reasonable.\n\nBut maybe someone could argue that she was too harsh. Some might say she should have given him more time or that her response was too quick. However, considering that it happened once and he had a history, she's taking a proactive step to protect herself. Also, he apologized and agreed to get help, so maybe she's not being unreasonable.\n\nAnother angle: in relationships, communication is key. She did talk to him, and he did respond. The fact that he apologized and agreed to therapy shows he took her concerns seriously. Her stance isn't about control but about safety. Anger issues can escalate, so addressing them early is smart.\n\nOn the flip side, some might say that throwing a cup of iced tea isn't that severe, and that she overreacted. But the author mentions it got everywhere and initially hurt. It's a valid reaction to being attacked, even if it's not a physical assault. The emotional impact is also significant, leading her to cry and leave.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the boyfriend's actions were the trigger. He had prior knowledge of his issues and reacted impulsively. The author isn't wrong for holding him accountable. Relationships require mutual effort, and she's setting a boundary for her well-being. It's her right to decide what she's willing to tolerate.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer seems to be B (No). The author isn't in the wrong. She's taking a stand for her safety and the health of the relationship, which is a responsible and justified action.\n"
