We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote this) is in the wrong. The situation involves a young couple where the boyfriend has anger issues, which were mentioned before but became apparent when he threw a cup of tea at her. The author then told him he needed therapy or she would leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend, 19, and the author, 18, have been together a month and a half. She felt comfortable because he said he felt safe with her. He had mentioned anger issues before, which she thought were just teenage behavior. The incident happened when she tapped him, and he reacted by throwing the cup. She left, and then demanded he get therapy or she would leave.\n\nSo, the key points are: 1) He had a history of anger issues he brought up. 2) The author took action after an incident that could have caused harm. 3) She set a clear boundary for his behavior.\n\nNow, determining if she's in the wrong. If the boyfriend's actions were aggressive and potentially harmful, the author has every right to set boundaries. Therapy is a reasonable request if someone has known issues. She didn't escalate the situation but took a firm stance after an incident that could have been more severe. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe she's being too pushy, but considering the situation, she's protecting herself. Also, he apologized and said he would get help, so maybe she's justified in needing that commitment. Young people might not have experience with this, but her reaction seems appropriate given the immediate threat to her safety and his prior statements about anger.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's prioritizing her safety and well-being, which is valid. The boyfriend's actions were inappropriate, and she's setting a necessary boundary.\n"
