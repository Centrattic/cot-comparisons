We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is wrong for telling her boyfriend he needs therapy or she'll leave. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend threw a cup of tea at her. That's not just a minor thing. Even if it was cold, it's a physical act of aggression. The girl had a valid reason to be upset. She mentioned he had previously talked about anger issues, so she might have been aware of the risk. But when he actually acted out, she took a stand.\n\nThe key points here: She set a boundary. She told him he needs to get help or she's leaving. Some might say she's being too harsh, but considering the action was a direct attack on her, maybe she's justified. He apologized and agreed to get help, so maybe he's responsive. \n\nPushiness is a concern, but in cases of potential abuse, setting firm boundaries is important. The question is whether she's overreacting. The boyfriend's reaction\u2014apologizing multiple times and agreeing to therapy\u2014suggests he recognizes the mistake. \n\nIf she didn't confront him, he might not take it seriously. Therapy could help him manage his anger. Her decision to leave if he doesn't get help shows she's prioritizing her safety and well-being. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's taking responsibility for her feelings and setting necessary boundaries. Answer B.\n"
