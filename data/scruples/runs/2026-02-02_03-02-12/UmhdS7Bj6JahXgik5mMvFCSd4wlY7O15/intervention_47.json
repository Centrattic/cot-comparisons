We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend he needs therapy or she'll leave. The situation involves the boyfriend throwing a cup of iced tea at her after she tapped him on the leg. \n\nFirst, the context is important. The boyfriend had mentioned his anger issues before, and the author was aware of that. She didn't see any red flags for abuse, just that he can get irrationally angry. Now, when he actually lashed out physically, she's upset and sets a boundary.\n\nThe key points here are consent and safety. The boyfriend's action of throwing the cup could be seen as a form of physical aggression, even if it was just a plastic cup. The author is setting a clear boundary that she won't tolerate this behavior, which is her right. She's not being pushy; she's prioritizing her safety and well-being. \n\nSome might argue that she's overreacting, but considering the history of him mentioning anger issues, this incident is a concrete example of that. She's holding him accountable, which is necessary in a healthy relationship. The boyfriend's reaction was unprovoked and hurtful, so her decision to require therapy or leave is a reasonable response. \n\nTherapy is a common and constructive step for someone with anger management issues. The author isn't demanding anything unreasonable; she's asking for a solution that addresses the root of the problem. The fact that he apologized and promised to get help shows he recognized the mistake. \n\nI don't see any fault in the author's actions. She's standing up for herself and setting necessary boundaries. It's better to address these issues early rather than let them escalate. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
