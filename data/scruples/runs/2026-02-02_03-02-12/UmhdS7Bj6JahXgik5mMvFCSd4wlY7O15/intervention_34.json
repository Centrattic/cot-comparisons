We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. Let me go through the situation again.\n\nSo, the author is an 18-year-old girl with a 19-year-old boyfriend. They've been together a month and a half. The boyfriend mentioned he gets irrationally angry, but she didn't think much of it. Then, during a walk, she taps him playfully on the leg, and he throws his iced tea cup at her face. She was upset, left, and told him he needed to get therapy or she was leaving. Now she's wondering if she was too pushy.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if her reaction is justified. The boyfriend's action was physically aggressive, even if it was a plastic cup with iced tea. It's not a severe injury, but it's a clear act of anger directed at her. The author is standing up for herself and setting a boundary by asking him to get help or she leaves. That seems reasonable because any form of aggression is concerning, especially when it's unprovoked. She's aware he mentioned anger issues before, so she's not ignoring red flags but addressing them once they materialize.\n\nIs she being too pushy? Well, she's not being abusive or unreasonable. She's giving him a clear choice: address the problem or the relationship can't continue. In healthy relationships, communication and setting boundaries are key. It's his responsibility to manage his anger, and she's not forcing him to do anything beyond what he's already agreed to. If he's not willing to seek help, then maybe that's a sign he's not committed to changing, which is his choice.\n\nAlso, considering their ages, they're both teenagers. While young, they can still have a healthy relationship. Her decision to prioritize her safety and mental well-being is valid. It's not about being pushy but about self-respect and safety. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. She's taking a mature approach to a problem she's aware of and acting on it to protect herself.\n"
