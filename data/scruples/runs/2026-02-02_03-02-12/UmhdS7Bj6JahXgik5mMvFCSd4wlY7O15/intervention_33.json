We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend he needs to get therapy or she'll leave. The context is that he threw a cup of iced tea at her after she tapped him, which was part of his anger issues.\n\nFirst, the situation involves a physical reaction that could be seen as aggressive. Even though it was a plastic cup and iced tea, throwing it at someone is an act of aggression. The author stood up for herself, left the situation, and set a boundary that he needs professional help. \n\nConsidering they're both teenagers in a new relationship, it's important to assess whether the boyfriend's actions are a one-time incident or a pattern. The author mentions he's had anger issues before but she didn't take it seriously at first. Now she's taking a firm stance. \n\nTherapy is a reasonable suggestion for managing anger. The author isn't being unreasonable by setting that boundary. She's prioritizing her safety and emotional well-being. The boyfriend's reaction was impulsive, and the author is holding him accountable. \n\nThere's no indication she gave him a chance to address the issue without consequences. She directly set clear terms, which is proactive. In relationships, especially when there's a threat or aggression, setting boundaries is crucial. \n\nI don't see the author as being in the wrong. She's taking a stand for her well-being and future in the relationship. So the answer should be B.\n"
