We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The story is about a 19-year-old boyfriend and an 18-year-old girlfriend who's been with him for a month and a half. The boyfriend has mentioned anger issues, which the author initially dismissed as typical teenage behavior. Then an incident happened where he threw a cup of iced tea at her after she tapped his leg as a joke. The author left, and then told him he either gets therapy or she's leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The boyfriend's actions\u2014throwing a cup of tea in her face\u2014is a physical reaction to her light tap. Even though it's just a plastic cup, it's an act of aggression, even if it didn't cause serious harm. The author is setting a boundary, which is important. She's stating that his actions are unacceptable and that he needs to address his anger issues through therapy. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's too pushy. The relationship is only a month and a half, so it's a new relationship. In such cases, setting boundaries early can be crucial for both parties. The boyfriend already mentioned his anger issues before, so the author wasn't out of the blue in her reaction. She gave him a clear ultimatum because she's concerned about her safety and future in the relationship. \n\nI should also consider the context of their age. Both are teenagers, so they might be learning how to handle relationships and emotions. The boyfriend's reaction was impulsive, and the author is taking a stand to protect herself. The fact that he apologized and said he would get help suggests he might take her seriously. \n\nBut maybe there's a different approach. Could she have handled it without the ultimatum? Perhaps, but in situations where someone's behavior is harmful, even if not physically abusive, setting a firm boundary can be necessary. The author isn't forcing him to do therapy but is making it clear that if he doesn't seek help, the relationship can't continue. \n\nLooking at it from the other side, is she being too harsh? Some might argue that one incident isn't enough, but given that he already mentioned anger issues, this incident could be a pattern. The author is acting in self-preservation. It's not uncommon for people to leave relationships where they feel unsafe or disrespected, even if the situation isn't violent.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's addressing a valid concern, setting a boundary, and taking responsibility for her own well-being. The answer should be B.\n"
