We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it properly.\n\nThe author is an 18-year-old girl in a relationship with a 19-year-old boyfriend. They've been together a month and a half. The boyfriend mentioned he has anger issues, which the author didn't mind because she used to be angry herself. Then, during a walk, she taps him on the leg with her foot, and he turns around and throws his iced tea cup at her face, getting her wet and causing her to be angry. She leaves, and he follows. She tells him he needs therapy or she's leaving. The question is whether she's in the wrong for setting that boundary.\n\nFirst, let me consider the key points. The boyfriend had already mentioned anger issues, so the author wasn't completely unaware. The incident happened when the boy reacted impulsively after being tapped. The author then sets a clear boundary that he must get help or she leaves. \n\nNow, from a relationship advice perspective, setting boundaries is generally a healthy thing. If someone has expressed concerns about a partner's behavior, especially when that partner has already warned about their own issues, it's reasonable to expect them to address it. The author isn't just reacting to the incident but is also acknowledging the prior warning. \n\nHowever, some might argue that she's being too harsh because it's a first incident and maybe he was just having a bad day. But considering that the boyfriend himself had mentioned his anger issues before, the author is addressing a pattern, not just an isolated event. \n\nAlso, the action of throwing a cup of iced tea, while not physically violent, could be seen as an act of aggression, especially since it caught the author off guard and caused her pain. The fact that the boyfriend apologized and felt regretful afterward suggests he recognized his mistake, which the author is now holding him accountable for. \n\nIn terms of the age and relationship duration, they're both young and the relationship is short. It's possible that the author is being overly strict, but on the other hand, addressing potential red flags early is wise. It's important to prevent future incidents that could be more serious.\n\nThe author's decision to require therapy is a reasonable step. Therapy is a common recommendation for managing anger issues. By setting that boundary, she's prioritizing her own safety and well-being, which is a valid choice. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. She's taking a responsible approach to a situation where her partner has shown a concerning behavior that he's already self-identified. It's proactive to seek professional help, and setting the boundary is a mature decision to protect the relationship's future.\n"
