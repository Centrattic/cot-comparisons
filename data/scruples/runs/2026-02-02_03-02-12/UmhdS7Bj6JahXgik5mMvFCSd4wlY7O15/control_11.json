We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the post) is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend he needs therapy or she's leaving. The situation involves the boyfriend throwing a cup of tea at her after she tapped him. \n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The boyfriend mentioned his anger issues before, and the author thought it was part of typical teenage behavior. But this incident escalated into a physical reaction\u2014throwing a cup. The author then set a boundary, demanding therapy or the end of the relationship.\n\nKey points to consider: \n1. **Safety**: The boyfriend's action was physical, even if it was a cup of tea. It could have been more dangerous. The author was hurt and felt unsafe, which is a valid reason to set a firm boundary.\n2. **Communication of Boundaries**: The author clearly communicated that this behavior was unacceptable. Setting boundaries is important in relationships, especially when safety is concerned.\n3. **Intent and Follow-through**: The boyfriend apologized and agreed to get help. The author isn't giving an ultimatum for no reason; she's addressing a specific harmful behavior that he's acknowledged.\n4. **Red Flags**: The boyfriend's reaction might be a red flag for potential abuse. The author is taking proactive steps to protect herself, which is reasonable.\n\nPotential counterarguments: Some might say the author was too harsh given the age and inexperience, or that the boyfriend's action wasn't violent enough to warrant ending the relationship. However, the key here is that the author is setting a boundary based on prior knowledge of the boyfriend's anger issues and a direct incident that caused harm.\n\nIn relationships, especially when there's a history of mentioned issues, setting clear expectations for change is not unreasonable. The author isn't being pushy for demanding accountability. She's taking responsibility for her own well-being and safety. There's no indication she's being controlling or without cause. So, the answer would be that she's not in the wrong.\n"
