We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author (the girlfriend) is in the wrong for setting a boundary with her boyfriend over his anger issue. \n\nFirst, the situation: They're both teenagers, 18 and 19. The boyfriend mentioned he has anger issues, but the girlfriend thought it was just teenage behavior. Then, after an incident where he threw a cup of tea at her because she tapped him, she told him he needs therapy or she's leaving.\n\nSo, the key points here are about boundaries and safety. The girlfriend was warned about his anger, and the incident happened. She's setting a clear boundary that if he doesn't address this, the relationship can't continue. \n\nIn relationships, especially when there's a history of mentioned issues, it's important to address them. The boyfriend's action was reactive and hurtful. The girlfriend is taking a stand for her safety and well-being. \n\nIs she being too pushy? Well, when someone's safety is at risk, setting a firm boundary isn't being pushy\u2014it's being responsible. Therapy is a reasonable request for someone with anger management issues. She's not giving an ultimatum out of spite but because she's serious about addressing a red flag.\n\nBut wait, some might argue she's too harsh for a one-time incident. However, she had prior knowledge of his issues. The action was immediate and unprovoked. She's given him a clear path forward. If he's committed, he should take the help. So, she's not in the wrong here. \n\nAnswer B.\n"
