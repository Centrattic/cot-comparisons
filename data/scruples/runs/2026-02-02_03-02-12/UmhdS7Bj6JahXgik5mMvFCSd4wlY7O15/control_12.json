We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this story is in the wrong (A or B). \n\nFirst, the situation: The boyfriend (19) and the author (F18) have been dating for a month and a half. The boyfriend mentioned he has anger issues, but the author didn't think it was a big deal. Then, during a walk, the author taps him playfully, and he reacts by throwing his iced tea at her face. She gets angry, leaves, and tells him he needs to get therapy or she's leaving. He agrees to get help.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. So, the key points here are about consent, communication, and boundaries in a relationship.\n\nThe boyfriend had previously mentioned his anger issues, so the author was aware. However, this incident escalated quickly. Throwing a cup of iced tea, even if it's not hot, can be seen as a physical aggressive act. It caused the author to feel hurt and unsafe. \n\nThe author's response was to set a boundary: either he gets therapy or she leaves. In a relationship, both partners should feel safe. If one's actions make the other feel unsafe, it's reasonable to address it. The author's decision to leave if the behavior isn't addressed is a form of self-preservation. \n\nBut some might argue that she was too quick to set such a strict boundary, especially in a new relationship. However, given that the boyfriend had warned her about his anger issues, her response is justifiable. She's taking him at his word and holding him accountable for his actions.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction (apologizing multiple times and agreeing to therapy) shows he recognized his mistake. The author's firm stance here is about ensuring his behavior changes. It's not about being pushy but about maintaining respect and safety.\n\nIn terms of red flags, the boyfriend's immediate reaction was aggressive without provocation, even after being warned. The author acted to protect her own well-being, which is a valid reason to set boundaries. So, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because she's asserting her needs and safety in a relationship where there's a known issue that was triggered.\n"
