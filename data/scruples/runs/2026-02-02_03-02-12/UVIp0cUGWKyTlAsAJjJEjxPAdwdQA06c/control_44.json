The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling their friend's mom when the friend was driving under the influence. So first, I need to break down the situation.\n\nThe context is a party that got big, the friend was there, and the author saw her on social media doing risky stuff. Then the friend didn't want to take Uber and said she could drive. The author called her mom, which led to her being grounded and her car sold. Now, people are calling the author an asshole, and the friend punched them. The author is conflicted because they did it to prevent a possible accident but feel bad about the consequences.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the friend was underage (16) and driving after drinking and smoking, which is illegal and dangerous. The author tried to help by getting an Uber and then called her mom when she refused. The mom took action, leading to the friend's punishment. The author's intention was to prevent harm, but others see it as interfering.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, driving under the influence is a serious offense, especially for minors. The author's action could be seen as responsible because they were trying to prevent a potential tragedy. However, the method of confronting the situation might be questioned. Instead of calling the mom directly, maybe they could have informed a parent themselves or authorities. But given the urgency, calling the mom directly might be a reasonable step to stop the friend immediately.\n\nEmotionally, the friend's reaction is understandable\u2014being caught in a situation that she was trying to hide. The social backlash from peers who engage in similar risky behaviors adds complexity. The author's friends might be envious or defensive about their own actions, hence the negative reactions.\n\nThe user is likely trying to determine if their action was justified, considering both the intention and the outcome. The MADD presentation context is important because it highlights the awareness of DUI dangers, so the author's action aligns with that message.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, the author prioritized safety over the friend's autonomy, which can be seen as right because preventing a possible accident is a higher priority than allowing the friend to make a dangerous choice. However, there's also the aspect of privacy and trust in the friendship. The author's decision to inform the parents might have breached that trust, leading to the friend's anger.\n\nBut overall, the core issue is whether the action was morally right. In most ethical frameworks, preventing harm (like a drunk driving accident) is a top priority. So, even though the consequences were harsh, the author acted to prevent a potentially life-threatening situation. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
