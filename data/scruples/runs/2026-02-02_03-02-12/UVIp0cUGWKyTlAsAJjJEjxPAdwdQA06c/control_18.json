The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves them calling their friend's mom because the friend was driving under the influence after a party.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is 17, and their friend was 16 at the time. The friend was at a party with a lot of drinking and drug use, and then decided to drive while still under the influence. The author tried to get her an Uber but she refused, saying Uber was too expensive. Then, the author saw videos of her driving while smoking, drinking, and texting. Concerned, they called the mom, leading to the friend's punishment and a physical altercation.\n\nNow, considering the legal aspect: driving under the influence is a serious offense, especially for minors. In many places, it's not only illegal but also dangerous. The author's action was to prevent a potential accident or harm to the friend and others. The friend was endangering herself and others, so someone needed to step in. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did call the mom without the friend's consent, which could be seen as a breach of privacy. However, given the circumstances, it's a form of intervention to prevent a dangerous situation. The friend's actions were reckless, and the author's intent was to stop her from driving drunk, which is not the typical \"harmless fun.\" \n\nThe friend's response was aggressive, punching the author. That reaction shows that the friend took the action very personally, but the author's intent was to prevent a more severe outcome. The MADD presentation at school the same day also highlights the awareness around drunk driving, making the author's action more justified in a context where the school was emphasizing the dangers of such behavior.\n\nThe author feels conflicted because they caused their friend to be grounded but also prevented a possible accident. The real question is whether the action was wrong. The key here is the potential harm vs. the immediate consequence (grounding). Preventing a DUI incident is a greater good, even if it caused personal conflict. \n\nIn the AITA subreddit, the community often considers the intent and the severity of the situation. Here, the author acted out of concern for safety, which is usually looked upon favorably. The friend's subsequent actions (punching) don't reflect on the author's wrongdoing but rather the friend's reaction to being caught. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's action was justified to prevent a dangerous situation, even if it led to personal consequences. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not the Asshole).\n"
