The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author in the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation is that the author, a 17-year-old in grade 12, called a friend's mom because they saw the friend driving under the influence. The friend was at a party, had been drinking and smoking, and the author tried to get her to take an Uber but she refused. Then the author called her mom, leading to the friend's punishment. Now, the author is feeling guilty because their friend hit them and they're no longer friends.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the actions. The key points are: the friend was underage, driving while impaired, and the author tried to intervene. The author's intention was to prevent a dangerous situation, which is a good motive. However, the method was calling the parent directly. \n\nIn many places, underage drinking and driving are illegal. The friend was 16 at the time, which is definitely underage. Driving under the influence is a serious offense. The author's action, while invasive, could be seen as trying to prevent a potential accident or harm. The friend's actions were risky, and the author might have felt responsible, especially after seeing the Snapchat videos.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have considered other options first, like calling the authorities instead of the parent. However, in the heat of the moment, the author might not have thought of that. Also, the friend's reaction and the subsequent fallout (being grounded, losing phone and car) were harsh, but the parent was the one to decide the punishment, not the author.\n\nThe friends who are now calling the author an asshole might be in denial about the danger of their actions. The author did prevent a possible accident, which is a positive outcome. The author's guilt stems from conflicting feelings between wanting to help and causing personal trouble for the friend. \n\nSo, considering the potential harm prevented versus the immediate fallout, the author's actions were in the right. The friend's parents handled the punishment, and the author acted out of concern for safety. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
