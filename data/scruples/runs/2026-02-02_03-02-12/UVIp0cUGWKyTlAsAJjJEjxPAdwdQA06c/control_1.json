The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author saw their friend was drinking and driving, and they called the friend's mom to report it. The friend ended up getting in trouble, and now people are mad at the author. The question is whether the author did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend was at a party, underage, drinking, and driving. The author knew she was driving and saw her driving while doing risky stuff like smoking and texting. So, the author tried to get her to take an Uber, but she refused. Then, the author took the step of calling her mom to prevent a potential accident. \n\nFrom a safety perspective, driving under the influence is extremely dangerous, especially for teenagers. The MADD presentation at school probably highlighted how serious DUI is. By calling her mom, the author was trying to prevent a potential tragedy. If the friend had crashed, it could have been fatal. So, the author's intention was good, to prevent harm.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't have the friend's consent to call her mom. There might be privacy concerns, but given the situation, the immediate danger of driving under the influence might outweigh that. The friend's choice to drive while impaired was a major risk, and the author felt responsible because they were a friend. \n\nThe friend got grounded and lost her phone and car, which is a consequence of the parent's decision. The author didn't have control over those punishments, but they did act in what they believed was the right thing to prevent a disaster. The friends and classmates who are upset might not see the danger as the author does. \n\nThe author mentioned they feel guilty both for getting the friend in trouble and for not acting if something bad happened. That shows they considered both possibilities. The act of reporting was a proactive step to prevent harm, which is generally seen as responsible, especially when a friend's life is at risk.\n\nHowever, the method of reporting could be questioned. Maybe the author could have tried to contact the parents directly without calling the mom, but given the urgency, calling the mom was a direct way. Also, the friend's response of punching the author is aggressive and wrong, but that's a result of the situation.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, preventing someone from driving drunk is a responsible action. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to stop a friend from making a deadly mistake. The fact that the friend and others are upset doesn't negate the rightness of the action. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were motivated by concern for safety, even if it caused personal conflict. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
