The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling their friend's mom about her driving under the influence. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 17, and there was a party that got big. They left early because they don't drink or smoke. Their friend, who was 16 at the time, stayed. The author saw on social media that the friend was drinking and smoking, and when they tried to get her an Uber, she refused. Then, the author saw videos of her driving while doing all that. So they called the mom. The friend's parents grounded her, took her phone and car. The friend and others called the author an asshole, and the friend even punched the author. Now the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author was trying to prevent a dangerous situation\u2014DUI is a big deal, especially with underage drinking. The friend was under 21 (since the author is 17 and in grade 12, the friend was 16). Driving under the influence is illegal and dangerous. The author took action to prevent a potential accident or worse. However, they might have overstepped by not involving other authorities first, but given the situation, they might have felt it was the only option. The friend's friends and classmates are upset because they see it as ruining their fun, but the author's intent was to prevent harm.\n\nNow, considering the options: A says the author is in the wrong. B says they are not. The author's actions could be seen as responsible, trying to prevent a DUI, which is a serious offense. However, maybe the method was not the best, but intentions were good. The friend's reaction (punching) is extreme. The parents' punishment was for the friend's actions, but the author did the right thing in terms of safety. So likely, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
