The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who called their friend's mom is in the wrong. The situation involves a high school party where underage drinking and drug use are happening. The friend, who is 16, is seen driving while under the influence and engaging in risky behavior. The author, who is 17, tries to get her to call an Uber but she refuses. Then, after seeing more evidence of her driving while impaired, the author contacts her mom.\n\nNow, the key points here are the legal and safety aspects. In the US, driving under the influence is a serious offense, especially for minors. The age of consent for driving varies by state, but the consequences for underage DUI are severe. The author's actions were aimed at preventing a potential tragedy. Even though the friend was upset and there were social repercussions, the author was trying to prevent a dangerous situation. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of privacy and the method used. By contacting her mother without perhaps a direct conversation with the friend first, the author might have bypassed a step that could have resolved the issue without escalating it. But considering the immediate danger of drunk driving, the author's intent was to prevent harm. \n\nThe friends and classmates are upset because they view the situation as harmless fun, but the author was acting in what they believed was a responsible manner. The MADD presentation at school adds context that the community is aware of DUI risks. \n\nSo, the author's primary concern was safety, and while the method might be debatable, the intent was to prevent a potential accident or legal issue. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
