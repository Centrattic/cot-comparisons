The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who called their friend's mom is in the wrong. The situation involves a high school party where underage drinking and driving were happening. The friend was driving after drinking and smoking, and the author called her mom to prevent potential danger.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend was 16 at the time, which is under the legal drinking age. The author saw her on social media doing dangerous things, tried to get her an Uber, but she refused. Then, after seeing her driving while impaired, the author called the mom. The friend's parents took action, grounding her and taking her car. The friend got angry and punched the author. Now, the author feels torn between guilt for getting her in trouble and relief that they might have prevented an accident.\n\nI should think about the legal aspects. At 16, driving under the influence is a serious offense, even if it's underage. The author's actions could be seen as preventing a potential DUI accident, which is a safety concern. On the other hand, calling a parent without the friend's consent could be considered overstepping, especially if the friend felt her privacy was invaded. But the alternative is that if the author didn't act, there could have been a tragic accident.\n\nAlso, the friend's friends are upset, but that might be because they were part of the same reckless activities. The author is concerned about being labeled an asshole for \"ruining\" the friend's life, but the parent's grounding seems to be a necessary consequence. The fact that the school had a MADD presentation that day might highlight the awareness of the risks involved.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author chose to act to prevent harm, which is generally seen as the right thing to do. The friend's reaction of violence is extreme, indicating possible resentment towards being held accountable. The author's intentions were to protect, not just to get her in trouble. However, there's the question of whether the author should have informed the friend first or trusted the parent's response. But considering the immediate danger, calling the parent was a proactive step.\n\nSo, balancing these factors, the author's actions were aimed at preventing a dangerous situation, which justifies their actions. The friend's punishment, while harsh, is a result of parental authority, not directly the author's. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
