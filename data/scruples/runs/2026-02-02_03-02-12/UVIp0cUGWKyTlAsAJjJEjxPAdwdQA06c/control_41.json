The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let's break this down.\n\nSo, the situation is a teenager (17 years old) who was at a party, saw their friend (who was 16 at the time) driving under the influence, and called her mom to prevent a potential accident. The friend ended up getting grounded and losing her phone and car. Now the friend and others are upset, and the author is feeling guilty about causing the trouble but also worried about what could've happened if they didn't act.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect. In many places, the legal drinking age is 21, so the friend was underage and definitely shouldn't have been drinking. Driving under the influence is illegal and dangerous, especially for a 16-year-old. The author saw their friend in a risky situation and tried to intervene. That seems like a responsible action.\n\nHowever, the method of intervention was calling the friend's mom. The friend had a chance to respond when the author offered to call an Uber, but she refused. Then, after seeing the Snapchat stories showing her driving while impaired, the author took action. The mom thanked them, so she appreciated the heads-up.\n\nThe consequences were severe grounding, but the author's motive was to prevent a possible DUI accident. The friend reacted violently, punching the author. The author is left feeling conflicted because they helped prevent a possible tragedy but caused personal consequences for their friend.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intent to prevent harm versus the outcome of their friend's punishment. Legally and morally, preventing someone from driving drunk is right. The friend made poor choices, and the author tried to stop her. Even though the friend is upset, the author's actions were in good faith. The friends who are criticizing the author are engaging in risky behavior themselves, which adds another layer.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for trying to prevent a dangerous situation. It's a tough spot, but their actions were responsible. The answer should be B (No).\n"
