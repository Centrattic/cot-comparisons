The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author did the wrong thing by calling their friend's mom about her driving under the influence. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is 17, in grade 12. They were at a party that got big, but they left early. Their friend, who was 16 at the time, stayed. The author saw on social media that the friend was drinking and smoking, and later saw videos of her driving while doing those things. The author tried to get her to take an Uber but she refused. Then, the author called the mom, and the friend ended up getting grounded and losing her phone and car. People are upset with the author, and their friend punched them. Now the author is feeling torn between guilt for getting her in trouble and maybe doing the right thing to prevent a crash.\n\nFirst, let's consider the legal aspects. In many places, driving under the influence is illegal, especially for minors. The friend was 16 and driving while intoxicated, which is a serious offense. The author was trying to prevent a potential accident, which is a valid concern. However, they took the step of calling the mother, which is a personal decision. Was that overstepping?\n\nOn one hand, the author had a good intention: to prevent harm. They might have thought that by informing the parents, they could stop the friend from driving drunk. On the other hand, the friend might have seen this as betrayal, especially since they were friends. The author didn't go through the friend first but went straight to the parents, which could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nBut considering the potential consequences of drunk driving\u2014like a car accident that could kill someone\u2014the author's action could be justified as a necessary intervention. The friend, in this case, was endangering herself and others by driving under the influence. The author's actions led to the parents taking action, which, while harsh, might have been the right decision in the long run to prevent a tragedy.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the friendship. The friend reacted violently, which shows that the action hurt their relationship. However, the friend's behavior was also dangerous. The author had every right to be concerned about their safety. The fact that others at school were also involved in risky behavior but didn't face consequences might make the author feel targeted, but the author's action was specific to a situation that could have had fatal consequences.\n\nThe school had a MADD presentation the same day, which emphasizes the dangers of drunk driving. The author's action aligns with that message, which is a positive point. The author might have felt a responsibility to act in line with what the presentation was teaching.\n\nHowever, there's a question about the method. Should the author have first tried to talk to the friend directly, maybe get a ride with her, or involved another trusted adult? But given the urgency of the situation and the fact that the friend was already refusing to take an Uber, the author might not have had more time. Calling the parents was a direct way to ensure the friend wasn't driving drunk.\n\nIn terms of ethics, preventing harm to others and oneself is a high priority. Even though the action caused personal conflict, the author's intent was to prevent a greater harm. The friend's reaction was violent, but that doesn't negate the initial concern. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to prevent a potential disaster, even if it had unintended personal consequences.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's actions were in good faith to prevent a dangerous situation. While the method of intervention might be debatable, the intent was to save lives, which is a valid reason. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
