The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post did the wrong thing by calling their friend's mom after witnessing her drink and drive. So, first, I need to evaluate the situation from both sides.\n\nThe friend was at a party, underage, and clearly not in a good state\u2014driving while smoking, drinking, and texting. The author tried to help by offering an Uber but was ignored. Then, after seeing Snapchat stories showing the friend's dangerous behavior, the author called the mother. The friend ended up grounded and lost her car, leading to anger from the friend and others, and a physical altercation.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the author's intent was to prevent a potential accident, which is a serious issue. DUI is illegal and dangerous, especially for minors. The friend's actions were reckless and could have led to a crash. The author took action to protect her, which might be seen as responsible. However, the method involved contacting a parent without the friend's consent, which could be seen as a breach of privacy.\n\nBut from a legal and ethical standpoint, preventing someone from driving under the influence is generally considered a good act. The author didn't confront the friend directly, which might have been another option, but in the situation, maybe calling the parents was the best choice. The friend's anger and the fallout are unfortunate, but the author's actions were motivated by concern for safety.\n\nOn the flip side, the author could have handled it differently. Maybe trying to talk to the friend more assertively or involving another trusted adult first. But considering the situation's immediacy and the potential danger, the author's action was a split-second decision to prevent harm.\n\nThe fact that the school had a MADD presentation the same day emphasizes the relevance of the issue. The author's actions align with the message of such presentations, which is to prevent DUI.\n\nIn terms of the friendship, the friend's reaction was violent and unforgiving, which is extreme. The author might have overstepped, but the intent was to prevent a dangerous situation. The guilt the author feels is understandable, but the alternative\u2014doing nothing\u2014could have had worse consequences.\n\nSo, weighing the safety of the friend against the breach of privacy and the subsequent fallout, I think the author's actions were justified. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
