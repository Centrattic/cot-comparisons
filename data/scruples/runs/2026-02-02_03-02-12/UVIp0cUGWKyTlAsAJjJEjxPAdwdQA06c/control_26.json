The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who called their friend's mom was in the wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They went to a party, it got big, their friend was drinking and driving. The person saw their friend on social media chugging vodka, smoking, and driving. They tried to get an Uber for her, but she refused. Then they called her mom, which led to the friend getting grounded and losing her car. Now the friend is mad, punched them, and they're being called names by others. The person is unsure if they did the right thing.\n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, driving under the influence is a serious issue. DUI can lead to accidents, injuries, or deaths. The person here was trying to prevent that by contacting the friend's parents. They had a valid concern for safety. On the other hand, the friend and others were upset because they felt it was their personal choice and the person overstepped by involving the parents.\n\nThe key points here are intent and consequences. The person's intent was to prevent a dangerous situation, which is good. However, the consequence was that the friend got in trouble, which caused a rift in their friendship. But the alternative could have been a tragic accident if the friend had driven drunk. \n\nLegally, in many places, it's a good deed to report someone who's driving under the influence. So the person might not be legally wrong. Ethically, it's a bit tricky. The person might feel guilty because the friend was angry, but the action was intended to prevent harm. \n\nThe people who called them names were probably protecting their friend's actions, which they saw as harmless fun. But the reality is that DUI is a serious offense, and the person took responsibility for the potential consequences.\n\nIn the end, the person acted out of concern for safety, which is a valid reason. Even though it caused personal conflict, the intent was positive. So the answer would likely be that they are not in the wrong.\n"
