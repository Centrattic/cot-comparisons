The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a 17-year-old who called another friend's mom because they were driving under the influence after a party. The author is worried about being considered the asshole (AITA) because people are calling them that, even though they thought they were doing the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The friend was at a party, drinking, and decided to drive. The author saw Snapchat stories showing her driving while smoking and drinking. The author tried to get her to take an Uber but she refused. Then he called her mom, which led to her getting grounded. Now, the friend is upset, and others are calling the author names. The author feels conflicted because he's worried about the friend's safety but also feels guilty for getting her in trouble.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author did the right thing. The possible angles here are safety vs. privacy, the duty to prevent harm, and the social consequences. The author's actions were motivated by concern for the friend's safety, which is a valid reason. However, the method\u2014informing parents without consulting the friend first\u2014might be seen as overstepping, especially if the friend is an adult (she's 16 but in high school, so probably 17 now). \n\nIn many places, 16 is the age for a learner's permit, so driving under the influence is a serious issue. The MADD presentation at school also underscores the importance of not driving drunk. The author's actions prevented a potential accident, which is a good outcome. However, the friend's reaction (punching him) and others calling him names suggest that the social fallout is significant. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Legally, maybe not. Ethically, it's a tough call. If the author had a duty of care (like a parent), then reporting would be appropriate. But as a friend, some might argue it's meddling. However, given the potential for serious harm, many would side with the author's decision. The friend's actions were dangerous, and the author's intervention likely saved lives. Even though the friend is upset, the author's intent was to prevent a tragedy. \n\nThe answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the consequences of not acting could have been worse. The author's actions were based on concern for safety, which is a valid reason. The friend's reaction and others' judgment might be short-sighted compared to the potential loss if she had driven drunk and caused an accident.\n"
