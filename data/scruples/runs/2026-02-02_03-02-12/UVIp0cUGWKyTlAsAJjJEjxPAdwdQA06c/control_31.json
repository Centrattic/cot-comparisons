The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who called their friend's mom is in the wrong. The situation is about a 17-year-old who organized a party that got out of hand, and then saw their friend driving under the influence after drinking and smoking. They texted the friend to call an Uber, but when she didn't respond, they called her mom. The friend got grounded, and there was a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The main issue here is whether the author was right to inform the mother. The friend was driving while impaired, which is a serious safety issue. DUI is a major problem, especially for minors. The author was worried about her safety and the safety of others, which is a valid concern. However, the friend's friends and classmates are upset, and the friend herself reacted violently by punching the author. \n\nThe author is torn between feeling guilty for causing trouble for the friend and thinking they did the right thing to prevent a potential accident. They mention that if something had happened, they would feel guilty for not acting. That's a common dilemma in such situations.\n\nLegally, in many places, if you know someone is going to drive under the influence, you have a duty to prevent it. However, calling their parents might be a personal choice that leads to social consequences. The author's action was intended to prevent a dangerous situation, which is a responsible action. The friend's reaction and the friends' insults might stem from not seeing the severity of the situation, perhaps viewing underage drinking and drug use as harmless, which isn't the case.\n\nThe fact that there was a MADD presentation the same day adds context that there's an awareness campaign against drunk driving, which the author took seriously. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to stop a dangerous act. The friend's family did take action, which shows that the author's intervention had the intended effect of protecting the friend. \n\nHowever, the social fallout is significant. The author lost a friend, but the alternative could have been a tragic accident. The answer hinges on prioritizing safety over social consequences. Since the author acted to prevent a potential catastrophe, they are not in the wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
