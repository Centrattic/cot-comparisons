The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing by calling their friend's mom about the friend driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 17, at a party that got big, and their friend stayed. The author saw the friend chugging vodka, smoking, and drinking shots. The friend was driving, and when the author tried to get her to take an Uber, she refused. Then, the author saw videos of her driving while smoking, drinking, and texting. The author called the mom, leading to the friend being grounded and losing her phone and car. The friend then punched the author and they stopped being friends.\n\nSo, the key points here are: The friend was underage (16 at the time), driving under the influence, engaging in dangerous behavior, and the author tried to prevent a potential accident by informing her parents. The friend and others are upset because they think the author ruined their fun and their life.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. From a legal and safety standpoint, driving under the influence is extremely dangerous. The friend was underage, which adds more risk. The author's actions could have prevented an accident. However, the author didn't have legal authority to do so, just a concerned friend. The response from the friend's parents was harsh, leading to the friend being punished, which the friend and her friends are upset about.\n\nBut from a moral perspective, the author was trying to prevent harm. The friend's actions were recklessly dangerous, and the author had a right to be concerned. The fact that the school had a MADD presentation the same day emphasizes the risks. The author felt conflicted because they wanted to prevent a tragedy but ended up causing personal conflict.\n\nThe friend reacted violently, which is a problem on her part. The author's actions were aimed at saving lives, even if it led to a fallout. So, legally and morally, the author isn't in the wrong. The real issue is the friend's irresponsible behavior and the parents' reaction. The author's intentions were good, even if the consequences were negative for the friendship.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
