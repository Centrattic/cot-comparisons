The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author saw their friend, who was 16 at the time, driving under the influence after a party. The author tried to get her to call an Uber but she refused, then the author called her mom. The mom then punished her by grounding her and taking her phone and car. The friend was angry and other friends were upset, calling the author an asshole. Now, the author is wondering if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, the legal drinking age is 21, so being 16, the friend was underage. Also, driving under the influence is illegal regardless of age. The author saw someone in a dangerous situation and tried to intervene. That seems responsible.\n\nBut then, maybe the author could have done it differently. For example, maybe they should have involved a parent earlier or contacted law enforcement? However, the author's immediate concern was that their friend was driving drunk and could get into an accident. Calling the parent directly might be a way to prevent immediate danger.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the same day there was a MADD presentation at school, which is about preventing drunk driving. That might have influenced the author's decision. But was the author's action the right way to handle it?\n\nThe friend ended up being grounded, which is a parent's decision. The author's intention was to prevent harm, but the friend took it personally and punched them. The author is now dealing with guilt from both not acting and causing trouble for their friend.\n\nOn one hand, the author tried to prevent a potential accident, which is a noble intent. On the other hand, the method of informing the parent could have been seen as overstepping, especially if the friend was a minor and the author isn't a parent. However, in some jurisdictions, it's legal to report underage drinking or DUI if you believe someone is in danger.\n\nThe key points are: underage drinking, driving under influence, potential danger to others, and the author's intent to prevent harm. The author's actions might be justified from a safety perspective but could be seen as interfering in their friend's life. However, given the potential consequences of drunk driving, the author is probably in the right. So the answer is B.\n"
