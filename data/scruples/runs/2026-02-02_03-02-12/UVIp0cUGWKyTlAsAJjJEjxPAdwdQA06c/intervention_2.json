The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who called their friend's mom for driving under the influence is in the wrong. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the key points: The person is 17, at a party where underage drinking was happening. Their friend, who's also 17 but was 16 at the time, stayed at the party. The friend was seen on social media doing drugs, drinking, and then decided to drive. The author tried to get her to use an Uber but she refused. Then the author called her mom, leading to the friend being grounded and losing her car. The friend and others accused the author of being an asshole, and there was a physical altercation.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did the right thing. On one hand, DUID (driving under the influence of drugs) is extremely dangerous, especially for a teenager. The author was trying to prevent a potential accident or worse. They had evidence through social media of the friend's actions. Calling a parent might be seen as a responsible action to prevent harm.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might feel betrayed because the author didn't talk to her directly first. Maybe the friend felt her privacy was invaded. Also, there's a loss of trust here, which is causing a rift in their friendship.\n\nBut considering the potential consequences of not acting\u2014like a car accident\u2014the author's intent was to prevent a dangerous situation. The mother's response was to ground the daughter, which seems appropriate given the situation. The fact that others were also involved, like other classmates with similar issues, suggests that the problem was larger than just the friend, but the author focused on the immediate threat.\n\nThe fact that there was a MADD presentation the same day might also highlight the importance of the issue, making the author's action more justified in that context.\n\nSo, weighing the potential harm of DUID against the immediate consequences for the friend, the author's action was likely in the right. The friend's reaction and the others' criticism seem misplaced given the danger involved. The author isn't obligated to take responsibility for others' actions, especially when it's about their safety.\n"
