The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who called the friend's mom was in the wrong. The situation involves a 17-year-old who saw their friend driving under the influence and decided to contact the mother. The friend was at a party, drinking, and then was seen driving while doing multiple risky things. The author's intention was to prevent a potential accident, but ended up getting the friend in trouble.\n\nFirst, consider the legal aspect. Driving under the influence is illegal, especially for a minor. The friend was 16 at the time of the incident, so even more so underage. The author's action might prevent a dangerous situation. On the other hand, the friend's friends are upset and see it as betrayal, which affects their social circle.\n\nThen, the relationship aspect. The author and the friend used to be close, but now there's a rift. The friend lashed out physically, which is a strong reaction. The author might feel guilty for causing the fallout, even if their intention was good.\n\nMoral responsibility: If the author had stayed silent and something bad happened, they might feel guilty. But by acting, they caused immediate consequences. However, the alternative was potentially risking lives. The MADD presentation at school that day adds context; it's likely the school was emphasizing the dangers of DUI, which the author took to heart.\n\nSocial consequences: The author is being called names by others who don't see the severity. The friend's grounding and loss of privileges are significant, but the author's action was a preventive measure. The question is whether the ends justify the means. \n\nLegally, the author did the right thing by reporting the dangerous behavior. However, the method of contacting the parent might be seen as overstepping, depending on the relationship. But in this case, the friend was a minor, and the parent has the right to be informed for their child's safety. The author's action could be justified in preventing harm, even if it led to personal conflict.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's intention was to prevent a dangerous situation, which is a valid concern. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
