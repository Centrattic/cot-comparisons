The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author called their friend's mom because the friend was driving under the influence after a party. The friend got grounded and even lost her car and phone, and now the friend and her classmates are mad at the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and safety aspects. The friend was 16 at the time, and the author is 17. Driving while under the influence is a serious offense, especially for minors. The author saw their friend driving while smoking, drinking, and texting, which is extremely dangerous. The parent's response was strict, which might be understandable given the risk involved.\n\nThen there's the moral angle. The author was concerned about their friend's safety and the safety of others. Even though it's a house party, where underage drinking and driving might be common, the author took action to prevent a potential accident. The fact that they didn't do anything for others but acted on this one instance could be seen as inconsistent, but their intent was to help. \n\nWhat about the friend punched them and the fallout? The friend's anger suggests that she felt betrayed. However, the author might not be responsible for the parents' punishment, as they just informed them of the danger. The parents decided the consequences, so the author's role was to warn them, not to set the punishment. \n\nThe classmates who were also involved in similar risky behavior are upset with the author. That's a bit of a hypocrisy issue, but the author specifically acted when the friend was driving, which is a different level of danger compared to just being at a party. \n\nThe MADD presentation the same day is probably a factor. The school was highlighting the dangers of drunk driving, which the author might have been influenced by. It shows that the community was being made aware of the risks, so the author's action aligns with that message.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have handled it differently. Like, maybe they should have tried to intervene in person before involving the parents. But considering the situation, the friend was already at the party and the author couldn't be there. The author saw the Snapchat videos, which indicated the friend was still engaging in risky behavior, so calling the mom was a last resort to prevent an accident.\n\nThe author's motivation seems to be genuine concern, even if it led to a bad outcome with the friend. They might feel guilty about the punishment, but the alternative was a potential tragedy. The friend's reaction, punching them, is clearly wrong, but the author's action was a protective measure.\n\nSo overall, the author's intention was to prevent a dangerous situation, and while it caused personal conflict, they were acting in good faith. The parents' response is their own choice, and the author isn't responsible for that. The friends' anger is misplaced, as the issue here is the friend's own actions leading to the consequence. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
