The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. So, I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the author is 17, in grade 12. They attended a party that got big, and their friend, who was 16 at the time, stayed. The author noticed through social media that the friend was drinking, smoking, and driving. They tried to get her to take an Uber, but she refused and insisted she was fine. Then, the author saw videos of her driving while doing all those dangerous things. So, the author called the friend's mom to inform her. The mom thanked them and hung up. The friend ended up grounded, lost her phone and car. The friend and others accused the author of being an asshole. Later, the friend punched the author.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. Let's break it down. The key factors here are the legal aspects and the moral responsibility.\n\nIn the US, the legal drinking age is 21. The friend was 16, so underage drinking is illegal. Driving under the influence is also illegal. The author saw their friend engaging in potentially life-threatening behavior. By calling her mom, the author was trying to prevent a possible accident or worse. The friend's actions posed a risk not just to herself but to others on the road. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't go through the friend directly to address the issue. They called the mom, which might be seen as bypassing the friend's autonomy. However, given the immediate danger, maybe it's understandable. The friend's response was violent, but the author's intent was to prevent harm. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they are not a smoker or drinker, indicating they weren't part of the partying themselves. They were concerned about safety. The MADD presentation at school that day reinforces the importance of preventing drunk driving. \n\nThe friend's punishment might be harsh, but the author's action was motivated by safety. While the author might have overstepped by not giving the friend a chance to resolve it herself first, the main issue is the potential danger prevented. \n\nIn terms of legal perspective, the author didn't commit a crime. Morally, it's a gray area. Some might argue that the author was right to act in preventing a possible tragedy. Others might think they should have handled it differently, maybe by contacting authorities instead of the mom. However, given the context, the author's actions were aimed at preventing harm, which weighs in their favor. The friend's violent reaction is regrettable, but the author isn't at fault for trying to stop a dangerous situation. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
