The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author calling their friend's mom because the friend was driving under the influence after a party. The friend then punched the author and they stopped being friends.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is 17, and the friend was 16 at the time. Both underage. The friend was at a party, doing drugs and alcohol, then decided to drive. The author saw the Snapchat stories, realized the danger, and called her mom. The mom thanked them, and the parents punished the friend. The friend and others at school are upset, and the author feels conflicted because they lost a friend but also feel guilty for getting her in trouble.\n\nNow, considering the possible angles. On one hand, the author's actions were to prevent a potential disaster. DUID is extremely dangerous, and underage drinking and driving are illegal and risky. The author might be seen as trying to do the right thing by protecting their friend. They weren't just reporting out of spite but because they saw real danger. Also, the MADD presentation the same day adds context about anti-drunk driving awareness.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author overstepped by contacting the friend's parents without the friend's consent. It could be seen as an invasion of privacy or betrayal of trust. The friend's reaction was violent, indicating she felt deeply wronged. The author's friend and others called them a \"dick,\" which suggests a social backlash. The author might feel isolated now, which is hurtful.\n\nBut underage drinking and driving is against the law, and the author's action prevented a possible accident or death. The friend's decision to drive while impaired was the root issue. The author acted out of concern for safety. Even though the friend was upset and their relationship ended, the author's intent was to prevent harm. In many cases, preventing someone from driving under the influence is considered a responsible and heroic action, not an asshole move.\n\nThe fact that the parents took appropriate disciplinary actions supports that the author did the right thing. The friend's resentment and the social backlash from peers might be more about peer pressure and underage drinking culture rather than the author being in the wrong. The author's guilt stems from the friend's punishment and the broken friendship, but their primary responsibility was to prevent a dangerous situation.\n\nTherefore, the author's actions were justified in preventing a potentially fatal accident. They prioritized safety over social consequences, which is commendable. The real issue here is the friend's underage drinking and decision to drive, not the author's intervention. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
