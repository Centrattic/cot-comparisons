The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author called their friend's mom because the friend was driving under the influence after a party. The friend was underage, 16 at the time, and the author was 17. The author saw the friend's Snapchat stories showing her drinking, smoking, and driving. They tried to get her to take an Uber, but she refused. Then the author called her mom, leading to the friend getting grounded and her car sold. Now the friend is mad, punched the author, and they're not talking anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and safety aspects. Driving under the influence is a serious offense, especially when underage. In many places, it's illegal for minors to consume alcohol, let alone drive after drinking. The author was trying to prevent a potential accident or harm, which is a valid concern. The friend's actions posed a risk not just to herself but to others on the road.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The author felt responsible enough to intervene, even though they weren't the ones driving. They used their phone to text and call the friend, tried to get an Uber for her, and when that failed, called her mom. That shows a level of concern for her safety. The author might have been trying to prevent a dangerous situation, which is a good intention.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't confront the friend directly or involve authorities like the police. Instead, they went to the mom, which could be seen as a breach of trust or privacy. However, considering the severity of the situation, involving a parent might be a reasonable step to ensure the friend's safety.\n\nThe friend and others at school are upset because they see the author as a \"snitch\" or someone who ruined their fun. But the author's action was to prevent a potentially fatal accident. The MADD presentation at school the same day adds context that there was an awareness campaign about drunk driving, which might have reinforced the author's decision.\n\nThe author's feelings of guilt come from both the consequence (friend getting in trouble) and the loss of the friendship. But is that guilt misplaced? If the alternative was a car crash with injuries or death, the author would have done the right thing. The friend's reaction of punching them and cutting off contact is extreme, but that doesn't make the author wrong for trying to help.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, minors are supposed to inform adults about dangerous situations. The author, being 17, might have a responsibility to report such unsafe behavior, even if it's a friend. The parents' reaction, while harsh, was in response to their child's actual risky behavior, not the author's intervention.\n\nSo, balancing safety and the consequences, the author's action was in good faith to prevent harm. While it led to negative outcomes for the friend, the intent was protective. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
