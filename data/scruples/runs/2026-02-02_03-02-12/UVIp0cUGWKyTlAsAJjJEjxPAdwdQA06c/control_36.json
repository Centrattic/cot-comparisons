The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a 17-year-old called their friend's mom because they saw her driving under the influence after a party. The friend was 16 at the time, which is underage in many places. The author was worried about her safety after seeing her on social media doing reckless stuff, like drinking and smoking, and then driving. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Driving under the influence is illegal, especially for someone under 21 if that's the age of majority in their state. If the friend was driving after drinking and smoking, that's a serious offense. The author's action was to inform her parents, which could prevent a potential accident. \n\nBut then, there's the reaction. The friend punched the author, and others called them a dick. The author is now questioning if they overstepped. On one hand, they were trying to prevent a dangerous situation. On the other hand, they might have overreacted by involving the parents without maybe giving the friend a chance to stop on her own. \n\nAlso, the friend was 16, so she's a minor. The parents have a responsibility to know her actions. The author, being her friend, might have a duty to intervene if they see something dangerous. However, the method of intervention\u2014calling the parents without warning the friend first\u2014could be seen as crossing a line. Maybe the author should have tried to stop her directly first, like confronting her or calling an Uber instead of immediately informing her parents. \n\nBut considering the context, the friend refused to get an Uber and insisted she was fine. The author had no control over the situation once the friend went to drive. The risk of her driving was high, so calling the parents might have been the only way to prevent harm. Also, the fact that the parents grounded her could have been a necessary consequence to ensure she understands the seriousness. \n\nThe aftermath is that the friend became hostile, but the author's intent was to prevent a possible tragedy. The friends who are doing similar things are upset because they might feel the author is a tattletale. However, the author isn't responsible for their actions. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author made a judgment call based on concern for safety. While there's a possibility of overstepping by involving parents, the primary goal was to prevent harm, which is a valid reason. The fact that the school had a MADD presentation the same day might emphasize the importance of the issue. \n\nSo, weighing all this, the author's actions were motivated by safety, even if the method was questionable. The key point is that preventing a potential DUI accident is more important than the immediate fallout with friends. Therefore, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
