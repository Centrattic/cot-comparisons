The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing by calling their friend's mom when they saw her driving under the influence. First, I need to consider the facts.\n\nThe situation happened at a party where underage drinking and drug use were occurring. The author, who isn't a drinker or smoker, left early. Their friend stayed and started posting videos of herself drinking, smoking, and doing shots. The friend was driving, and when the author tried to get her to call an Uber, she refused. Later, the author saw videos of her driving while impaired. So the author called her mom to prevent a potential accident.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is trying to prevent a dangerous situation. DUI is a serious offense and can lead to fatal accidents. By informing the friend's parents, the author is acting in what they believe is the friend's best interest and public safety. However, the author's friend and her friends are upset because they view it as interfering in their \"fun.\" The friend even physically assaulted the author, which adds complexity.\n\nNow, considering the possible consequences: if the author hadn't acted and the friend had a crash, the guilt would be heavier. But by acting, the author caused immediate repercussions like being grounded and losing her car. The author is conflicted because they want to help but also feel responsible for the fallout.\n\nLegally, in some places, you can report someone if you believe they're about to commit a crime, like DUI. The author's action might be legally justified as a good Samaritan. Emotionally, the friend's reaction is extreme, but the author's intent was to prevent harm. The MADD presentation at school also highlights the real dangers of drunk driving, which the author might have been influenced by.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author overstepped by contacting the parents without the friend's consent. Privacy and autonomy are considerations here. However, the potential risk of a DUI accident is a strong argument in the author's favor.\n\nBalancing these points, the author's actions were aimed at preventing a dangerous situation, which is commendable. While the fallout is unfortunate, the intent was protective. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
