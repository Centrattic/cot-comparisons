The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who asked this question is in the wrong for calling their friend's mom when they saw her driving under the influence. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is 17, in grade 12, and went to a house party that got out of hand. They left early because they don't drink or smoke. Their friend, who was 16 at the time, stayed. The author saw the friend's Snapchat stories showing her chugging vodka, smoking, and doing shots. They tried to get her to call an Uber but she refused, saying it's too expensive. Then, after 30 minutes, the author saw more videos of her driving while smoking, drinking, and texting. The author called the friend's mom to report this. The mom thanked them and hung up. The friend came back to school the next day but was grounded, lost her phone and car. Her friends and classmates started calling the author an asshole. The friend punched the author and they haven't talked since. The author is now conflicted, feeling both relieved they acted and guilty about the consequences.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me think about the factors here. \n\nFirst, the friend was under 21 (assuming 18 is the drinking age in their country, but in the US, it's 21, but the friend was 16, so definitely underage). She was engaging in underage drinking, drug use, and driving under the influence, which are all illegal. The author witnessed this through social media and then tried to intervene. The author's actions were to prevent a potential accident or worse by informing the parents. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, driving under the influence is a serious offense, especially with texting and smoking while driving. The author's decision to involve the parents could be seen as responsible, as they were trying to prevent a dangerous situation. However, there's a moral aspect here too. The author didn't confront the friend directly but went straight to her parents. That might be seen as bypassing the friend's autonomy, but given the potential danger, it's understandable. \n\nThe friend's reaction was to punch the author, which is violent and inappropriate. The classmates also criticized the author for \"ruining her fun,\" which is a common reaction when someone takes a responsible action. But the author's priority was safety, not social approval.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have tried to confront the friend more directly first, maybe using a ride service for her, but she refused. The author did offer to call Uber for her, but she declined. Then, seeing her still driving recklessly, they escalated to calling the parents. That seems like a reasonable step given the immediate danger.\n\nThe consequences were harsh (grounding, losing car and phone), but the author didn't cause those; the parents did. The author's intent was to stop a dangerous situation, not to get her in trouble. The guilt they feel comes from the fallout, but their intention was to prevent harm.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions were motivated by concern for safety and preventing a potential accident. The friend's actions were illegal and dangerous. The author took a step to involve a responsible adult when direct intervention failed. While the fallout is negative, the author isn't in the wrong. The friend and others are at fault for their behavior and reactions.\n"
