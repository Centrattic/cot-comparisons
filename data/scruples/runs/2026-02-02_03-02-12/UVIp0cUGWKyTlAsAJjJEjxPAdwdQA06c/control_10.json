The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who called their friend's mom is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the friend was at a party, drinking, smoking, and driving. The author tried to get her to take an Uber but she refused. Then they saw videos of her driving recklessly. The author called her mom, leading to her being grounded and losing her car. Now the friend is mad, punched the author, and they're no longer friends.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did the right thing. The options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nThe key points here are intent and consequences. The author's main concern was to prevent a potential DUI accident, which could have serious, even fatal, consequences. They were trying to protect their friend's safety. On the other hand, the action of calling the mom caused immediate trouble for the friend, leading to her being punished and the friend taking out her anger on the author.\n\nBut from a moral standpoint, preventing a dangerous situation is generally considered the right thing. The author didn't have malicious intent; they acted out of concern. The consequences were harsh, but the alternative was risking her life and others. The friends who criticized the author were participating in similar risky behaviors, which doesn't excuse their actions but shows that the author's intervention was necessary to prevent a worse outcome.\n\nAlso, the fact that there was a MADD presentation the same day highlights the importance of such actions. The author's intervention might have saved lives, even if it caused personal conflict. The friend's reaction (punching the author) is impulsive and wrong, but that doesn't make the author the problem. The author is left dealing with guilt from both possible outcomes\u2014either risking the accident or causing personal conflict.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions were in good faith to prevent a potential disaster. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
