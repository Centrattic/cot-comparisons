The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is 17, in grade 12. They went to a house party that got pretty big. They left early because they don't drink or smoke. Their friend, who was 16 at the time, stayed. Later, the user sees the friend on social media doing a bunch of bad stuff\u2014drinking, smoking, doing shots. They know the friend drove there, so they text her to get an Uber. When she doesn't respond, they call and offer to pay. She refuses and says she's fine to drive. Then, the user sees videos of her driving while smoking, drinking, and texting. So they call her mom, who thanks them and hangs up. The friend's parents ground her, take her phone and car. The friend's friends are mad at the user, calling them a dick. The friend later punches the user at school. Now the user is wondering if they were the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The friend was 16, so underage. Driving under the influence is illegal for anyone, regardless of age. In many places, even attempting to drive under the influence is a serious offense. The user saw their friend doing dangerous things while driving, which could lead to a crash. The user's action of informing the mom might prevent a potential disaster.\n\nOn the other hand, the user didn't know exactly what the mom would do. They might have caused the friend to lose her privileges without knowing if the mom would have handled it differently. Also, the user didn't report to authorities but called the mom directly, which is a personal choice. However, the friend's actions were risky and illegal, so the user's intent was to prevent harm.\n\nThe friend's friends are upset because they also engage in similar behavior, which suggests there's a pattern of risky behavior. The user's action might have drawn attention to the friend's specific actions, making others angry because they fear similar consequences.\n\nThe MADD presentation the same day adds context. It's a campaign against drunk driving, so the user's action aligns with that message. The friend's parents taking action supports the idea that they were acting responsibly based on the information provided.\n\nThe user now feels guilty for getting the friend in trouble but also for potentially preventing a disaster. The friend's physical reaction (punching) shows a breakdown in their relationship, but the user's initial concern was safety.\n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, the user acted to prevent a possible accident or legal trouble. While it's a personal choice to involve the parents, the intent was protective. The consequences were harsh, but the user didn't cause the grounding; the parents did based on the information given. The user isn't legally responsible for the friend's actions, but they chose to intervene. Whether it's the \"right\" thing depends on perspective\u2014some might say it's meddling, others that it's responsible.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is not in the wrong because they prioritized safety and prevented a potential accident. The friend's anger and friends' reactions are misplaced given the risks involved. So the answer should be B.\n"
