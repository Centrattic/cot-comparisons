The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who called their friend's mom was in the wrong. The situation involves a high school party where underage drinking and drug use happened, and the friend decided to drive home while impaired.\n\nFirst, the author is 17, and their friend was 16 at the time. The friend was driving after drinking and smoking, which is a serious issue. The author tried to call an Uber but the friend refused, thinking it was too expensive. Then, after seeing the friend driving dangerously, the author contacted her mom. The friend's parents took action, grounding her and taking away her phone and car. However, other classmates and friends are upset with the author for \"ruining\" the friend's fun, and the friend even punched the author.\n\nThe key points here are the legal aspects. In most places, driving under the influence is illegal, especially for minors. The author's action was to prevent a potential DUI or car accident. The friend was endangering herself and possibly others. The author's intent was to stop a dangerous situation, not just to get her in trouble. However, the friend's reaction and the social backlash are significant factors.\n\nOn one hand, the author acted to prevent harm. On the other hand, calling the mom might have caused personal consequences for the friend. But since the friend was breaking the law and putting lives at risk, the author's intervention could be justified. The fact that there was a MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving) presentation that day adds weight to the decision, as it's a direct response to the topic discussed.\n\nThe friend's parents handled it by grounding her, which the author might feel responsible for, but the alternative could have been a tragedy. The author's guilt stems from the friend's anger and loss of friendship, not necessarily the action itself. The friend's punch and hostility might be a result of her own actions and guilt, not just the author's.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions were in the interest of safety, which is a higher priority than allowing underage drinking and driving. So the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
