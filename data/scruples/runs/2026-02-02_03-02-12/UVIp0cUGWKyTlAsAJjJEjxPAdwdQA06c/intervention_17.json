The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. So the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for calling their friend's mom when they saw her driving under the influence. \n\nFirst, let's break down the facts. The author is 17, at a party, and sees their 16-year-old friend posting about drinking and smoking. The friend is supposed to drive home but refuses to call an Uber. Then, the author sees videos on Snapchat of the friend driving while smoking, drinking, and texting. The author calls the mom, which leads to the friend getting grounded and losing her car. The friend punches the author later.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author did the right thing by contacting the mom. From a legal standpoint, driving under the influence is dangerous, especially for minors. The author witnessed potential DUI and reckless behavior, which could lead to accidents. By informing the parents, the author was trying to prevent a possible tragedy. The friend's actions were not just about having \"harmless fun\"; they were putting themselves and others at risk.\n\nHowever, the author could have considered other options first. Maybe calling a family member or a trusted adult, or even contacting authorities if they couldn't reach the parents. But in this case, the author did contact the mom, which was a direct action to prevent danger. The friend's reaction and the backlash from peers don't negate the seriousness of the situation. The author's intent was likely to protect the friend, even if the method caused immediate conflict.\n\nThe MADD presentation at school also adds context, highlighting the importance of preventing drunk driving. The author's actions align with that message. While the friend's parents' punishment might seem harsh, the alternative\u2014allowing the friend to drive intoxicated\u2014could have had far worse consequences. \n\nSo, the key points are the potential danger of the friend's actions and the author's attempt to intervene. While the method might have been direct, the intent was protective. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for trying to prevent a dangerous situation, even if the outcome was a strained friendship and backlash.\n"
