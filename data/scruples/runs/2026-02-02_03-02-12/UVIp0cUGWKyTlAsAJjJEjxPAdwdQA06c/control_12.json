The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) question is in the wrong for calling someone's mom when they were driving under the influence. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 17 and witnessed their friend, who was 16 at the time, driving under the influence after a party. The author tried to get an Uber for her, but the friend refused. The author then called the friend's mom, leading to the friend being grounded and losing her car. The friend retaliated by punching the author, and others are upset with the author for \"ruining\" the friend's fun.\n\nNow, considering the key points. The friend was underage (16), driving after drinking and using drugs, and engaging in risky behavior. The author acted out of concern for safety, which is a valid reason. The fact that there was a MADD presentation the same day might emphasize the importance of the issue. The author's actions prevented a potential accident, which is a responsible choice.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't confirm if the friend was actually impaired before calling the mom. However, the evidence from the Snapchat stories showed clear signs of dangerous behavior. The author's intent was to prevent harm, not to get the friend in trouble for fun.\n\nThe friend's retaliation and others calling the author an asshole is a consequence, but the author's primary concern was safety. The ethical consideration here is whether preventing a potential tragedy justifies the immediate consequences. Since the friend was underage and the behavior was reckless, the author's action is more about protecting lives. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author acted responsibly to prevent a dangerous situation, even if it caused personal conflict.\n"
