The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author called a friend's mom because they thought the friend was driving under the influence after a party. The friend was at a party, the author saw her drinking and driving, tried to get her to call an Uber but she refused. Then the author called her mom, which led to the friend getting grounded and losing her phone and car. Now the friend is angry, punched the author, and they're no longer friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's intentions. The main point here is that the author was trying to prevent a potential DUI or a car accident, which is a serious safety issue. Driving under the influence is illegal and dangerous, especially for minors. The author saw the friend in videos drinking and driving, which is a red flag. The author's action was to protect the friend's safety, even though it had consequences.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't talk to the friend first and went straight to the mom. That might have been a direct approach, but maybe they should have tried to intervene in person first? However, the friend was already ignoring texts and calls, and the author couldn't reach her in time. The author's concern was valid given the circumstances. Also, there was a MADD presentation that same day, which probably highlighted the dangers of drunk driving, so the author's action aligns with promoting safety.\n\nBut the consequences were that the author caused the friend to get in trouble with her parents, leading to a strained relationship. The friend and others are upset because they saw it as ruining their fun. The author might feel guilty about the relationship fallout, but the initial intention was to prevent a potentially fatal accident.\n\nSo, the key factors here are the intent to prevent harm versus the method of intervention. Legally, driving while under the influence is a serious offense. The author's action was to prevent a dangerous situation. Even though the method might have been abrupt, the intention was good. The friend's anger is about losing freedom and social consequences, but the author's action was in response to an immediate danger.\n\nTherefore, considering the potential for a serious accident, the author's intervention was justified. The author isn't in the wrong because they acted to prevent harm, even if it caused social repercussions. The friend's reaction is understandable given the consequences, but the author's intent was protective.\n"
