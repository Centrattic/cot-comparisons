The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for calling someone's mom when they were driving under the influence. The situation is that a 17-year-old found out their friend was driving while smoking, drinking, and texting. They called the friend's mom, which led to the friend getting grounded and having her car sold. The friend and others are upset, and there's some fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and safety aspects. Driving under the influence is a serious offense. Even though the person is a minor, it's still dangerous. The author acted to prevent a potential accident or harm. In many places, there's a duty to report someone if they're in immediate danger. So from a safety standpoint, the author might be justified.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The friend was upset and others called the author an asshole. But the author's intention was to prevent harm, not just get the friend in trouble. The fact that there was a MADD presentation that day might emphasize the educational context about the dangers of DUI. The author's actions align with what the presentation was about, which could support their decision.\n\nHowever, maybe the author could have handled it differently. Perhaps contacting a parent directly might have been a good move, but calling the mom might not be the best approach. But given the situation, the author saw imminent danger and acted. The consequences for the friend were severe, but the author's intent was protective.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the action prevented a potential tragedy, then no. The key factors here are intent and the immediate risk. The author isn't responsible for the punishment the parents gave; that's the parents' decision. So the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
