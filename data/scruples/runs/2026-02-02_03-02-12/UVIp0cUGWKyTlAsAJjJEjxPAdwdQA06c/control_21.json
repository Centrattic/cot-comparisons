The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The person called their friend's mom because they saw her driving under the influence after a party. The friend was 16 at the time, so under the legal driving age, and was doing dangerous things like smoking, drinking, and texting while driving.\n\nFirst, the situation involves underage drinking and driving, which is illegal and dangerous. The author tried to stop their friend by offering to get an Uber, but when that didn't work, they informed the parent. The parent took action, grounding the friend and taking away her phone and car. The friend then got angry and even punched the author.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author did the right thing. On one hand, the author was trying to prevent a potential accident or tragedy by informing the parent. Underage drinking and driving is a serious issue, and the author might have felt responsible to act. The fact that the school had a MADD presentation that day adds context about the awareness of the dangers involved.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't directly confront the friend after she refused to take an Uber. They called the parent, which might have been a breach of trust. The friend and others at school reacted negatively, saying the author was an asshole. The author now feels guilty for getting the friend in trouble with her parents and losing a friend.\n\nBut considering the legal and safety aspects, the author's action could be seen as necessary. Driving under the influence can lead to severe consequences, and by informing the parent, the author might have prevented a possible crash. The friend's actions were reckless, and the author was trying to stop her. However, there's a line between concern and overstepping. The author could have perhaps involved a trusted adult or authority figure at the party first, but given the circumstances, calling the parent might have been the only option left.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's intention was to prevent harm, which is understandable. While the consequences were personal for the friend, the author was trying to do the right thing in a dangerous situation. So, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
