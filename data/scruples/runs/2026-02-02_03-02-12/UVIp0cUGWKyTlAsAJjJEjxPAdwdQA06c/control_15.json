The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's friend was driving under the influence, and the author called her mom to stop her. The friend ended up getting grounded and lost her phone and car. Now people are upset, and the friend punched the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and safety aspects. Driving under the influence is a serious offense, especially for a minor. The author saw her friend driving while smoking, drinking, and texting, which is extremely dangerous. By calling her mom, the author was trying to prevent a potential accident or worse. \n\nThen, there's the question of the author's intent. The author mentions they were concerned because they saw the friend's Snapchat stories showing reckless behavior. They tried to get her to take an Uber but she refused. So the author's intention was to prevent harm, not just to get her in trouble. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have handled it differently. Like, maybe they could have gotten someone else to help, or called the police instead of involving the parents. But given the age of the individuals (17 and 16), calling the police might not have been the immediate thought. Also, the author was trying to help a friend, not cause trouble. \n\nThe friend's reaction was violent, which is a problem, but that's her choice. The author didn't provoke her to punch them. The classmates are upset because they were also doing similar things, which might indicate a broader issue of underage drinking and drug use, but that doesn't justify the friend's actions or the author's intervention being wrong.\n\nThe MADD presentation at school adds context that there's an awareness campaign against drunk driving. The author's action aligns with that message. So, the author was acting in line with promoting safety, which is a positive action. \n\nHowever, the author might feel guilty because the friend's life was affected. But the alternative of not doing anything could have led to a much worse outcome. The author had to make a choice between letting a dangerous situation happen or intervening. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions were meant to prevent a potential tragedy. The consequences for the friend were severe, but the author's intent was good. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
