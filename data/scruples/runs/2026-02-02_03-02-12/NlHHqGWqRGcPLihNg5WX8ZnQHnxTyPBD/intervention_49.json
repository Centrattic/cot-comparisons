      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend often rides in the author's car, and the author covers the gas costs. This time, the author forgot their purse and the friend put $10 in gas as a gesture. The author then decided to stop offering rides and told the friend to find their own way. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants a confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The friend has been getting free rides and gas for hundreds of times. The one time the author forgot something, the friend contributed a bit. But the author is now cutting off the rides. The question is whether the author is justified.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author has been covering all the costs. The friend never contributed before, so even a small gesture like $10 might not be enough to make up for the cumulative cost. The author might feel taken advantage of, so cutting off the rides could be a way to set boundaries. On the other hand, the friend might feel that the $10 was a kind gesture, but maybe not enough to change the overall dynamic.\n\nLegally, the author isn't in the wrong because there's no contract here. Socially, it's about expectations. The author probably expected some form of reciprocity, which wasn't there. The friend's $10 might be seen as an attempt to fix the situation, but if the author feels that it's not enough, they have the right to end the arrangement. The author isn't obligated to continue offering rides if they're not comfortable with the arrangement anymore.\n\nAnother angle: the author's decision to stop rides could be seen as a reasonable response after feeling that the balance is unfair. The friend's previous behavior was one-sided. The author is assertive in their own needs, which is a positive trait. Unless the author is being overly harsh without a valid reason, they're not the asshole here.\n\nPotential counterarguments: Maybe the author is overreacting to a small act of goodwill. However, the friend's consistent lack of contribution over hundreds of times could justify the author's frustration. The $10 was an exception, not a norm. So, the author's reaction is about setting boundaries after repeated one-sided behavior.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to decide the terms of their interactions and can end the arrangement if they feel it's unfair. The answer should be B.\n"
