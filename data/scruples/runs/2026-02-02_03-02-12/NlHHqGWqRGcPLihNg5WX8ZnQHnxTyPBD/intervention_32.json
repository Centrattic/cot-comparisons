      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about ending free rides for a friend. The friend has always ridden in their car without contributing to gas, except once when they put $10 in gas because the author forgot their purse. The author is now telling the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points here. The friend has used the car hundreds of times without paying gas. There's a one-time exception where they contributed $10. The author is ending the arrangement, which the friend might see as unfair. \n\nThe question is whether the author is an asshole. The author's reasoning is that they're covering all the gas costs, maintenance, etc. The friend is essentially free-riding. The one-time payment of $10 isn't enough to balance the cost over hundreds of rides. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they're setting boundaries. They've been covering all costs, and now they're saying it's time to stop. The friend might feel entitled because they contributed once, but that's not proportional. \n\nThe author isn't being mean; they're just stopping the arrangement. It's about fairness. People often have friends who take advantage, and setting a boundary isn't necessarily wrong. The friend should have contributed more or found other ways to help out instead of relying on the author's generosity.\n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong here. They're asserting their right to not be taken advantage of. The friend needs to find their own transportation, which is reasonable given the circumstances.\n"
