      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend has been riding in their car hundreds of times without contributing to gas, but this one time the author forgot their purse, so the friend put $10 in gas when they returned it. Then the author told the friend to find their own way around in the future.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend has a history of not contributing to gas costs, using the author's car frequently. The friend only contributed once when the author forgot their purse. The author then stops offering rides, leading to the friend being upset. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the author might feel that the friend isn't contributing their fair share. Gas costs can add up, especially with frequent use. The friend's one-time contribution of $10 doesn't seem to compensate for hundreds of rides. The author setting boundaries here could be seen as reasonable. Maybe the friend took advantage of the situation, expecting a free ride without reciprocating.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of friendship. If the author is the one offering the rides, maybe they should have set expectations earlier. But the friend hasn't contributed at all except that one time, which the author might see as a one-off gesture rather than a regular contribution. The author's response of stopping rides might be a way to enforce some form of contribution or to stop the friend from relying on them without any giveback.\n\nThe friend's reaction could be that they're upset because the author is now making them find other transportation. But if the author is the one who decided to stop, maybe that's their right. It's about mutual respect and boundaries. The author isn't obligated to provide rides, so ending them isn't necessarily wrong, especially since the friend didn't contribute before.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the author should have discussed the gas cost earlier instead of ending it abruptly. But the friend never offered to contribute until the purse incident. The author's frustration is valid if they feel taken advantage of. So, the author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary after the friend's one-time contribution, especially if they've been using the car without paying consistently.\n\nI think the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They're enforcing a boundary after the friend's inconsistent contribution. The friend's behavior of not paying gas regularly is the issue here. The author's action is about fairness in the friendship.\n"
