      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend regularly uses their car without contributing to gas, except once when they put in $10 after the author forgot their purse. The author then told the friend to find another way to get around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is the one providing a service (rides) without compensation, and the friend has been taking advantage of that. The friend contributed once, but that's not consistent. The author is setting a boundary, which is their right. However, maybe the friend didn't realize the author was upset about the lack of contribution in other times. But the key point here is that the author is ending the rides, which could be seen as standing up for themselves. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're asserting their own needs. They've provided a lot of rides without any contribution, and now they're saying it's time for the friend to take responsibility. The friend's one-time contribution of $10 might have been a good gesture, but it's not enough to make up for all the previous free rides. The author isn't being unreasonable by asking the friend to find their own transportation now. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
