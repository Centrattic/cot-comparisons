      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the question is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend often takes rides in their car, and the author fills up the gas. The friend only put gas in once when the author forgot their purse, and the author is now saying the friend should find their own way.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The friend has used the car hundreds of times without contributing to gas. The one time they did contribute was when the author forgot something, and the author is now telling them to find their own way. The main issue is whether the author is justified in ending the free rides.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the friend didn't contribute much, so the author might feel it's unfair to always cover the gas. The author is within their rights to set boundaries, especially if they feel the friend isn't contributing their fair share. Also, the fact that the friend only put in $10 when the author forgot their purse might not be a valid reason to continue offering rides without contribution. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of friendship. Maybe the author should have communicated their expectations earlier, like asking the friend to chip in for gas on a regular basis instead of only once. However, the friend never did that, so when the author ends the rides, they might be justified because they're standing up for their own interests. \n\nAnother angle is the expectation of reciprocity. If the author was doing this as a favor, they might expect some form of contribution. Since the friend didn't contribute except once, the author's decision to stop could be seen as reasonable. However, if the author didn't ask for contributions and the friend didn't offer, maybe there's a misunderstanding. But the author is now setting a boundary, which is their right.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their own needs and setting boundaries after feeling they've been taken advantage of. The answer should be B (No).\n"
