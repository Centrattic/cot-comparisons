      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the author's friend has been riding in their car hundreds of times without contributing to gas, except once when the author forgot their purse and the friend put in $10 for gas. Then the author told the friend to find their own way around in the future. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong and wants to confirm.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms and expectations here. Offering rides is often seen as a kindness, but there's an unspoken agreement about sharing costs when it's a regular thing. The friend has been using the author's car frequently without contributing, which could be seen as taking advantage. The one time the friend did contribute was when the author forgot their purse, which might have been a coincidence or a reaction to being reminded. \n\nThe key points are: the friend's consistent lack of contribution, the one-time exception, and the author's decision to stop providing rides. The author is setting a boundary after repeated use without reciprocation. Socially, it's reasonable to expect some contribution if it's a regular occurrence, especially when it's costing the author money. The friend might feel the author is being unfair, but the author has the right to set limits on their own resources.\n\nAlso, the act of ending the rides is a form of self-preservation, ensuring that the author isn't shouldering the entire cost. The friend's initial gratitude for the ride might not extend to covering the gas, but in this case, the friend has been using it as a free service. The author isn't obligated to continue offering rides without some form of reciprocation, especially after hundreds of instances without contribution.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong for setting this boundary. The answer should be B.\n"
