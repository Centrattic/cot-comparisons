      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about ending free friend rides in their car.\n\nSo the author's friend always rides with them, they fill the gas tank, and drop the friend off. Last weekend, the friend put $10 in gas because the author forgot their purse at home. Now the friend asked for the money back. The author says they've ridden hundreds of times without putting gas, and they told their friend to find their way around in the future.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong. I need to decide if the answer is A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nFirst, the friend used the car for rides many times without contributing to gas. Then, once, when the author forgot their purse, the friend gave $10. Now the author is ending the rides. \n\nThe key points here: Did the friend have an obligation to pay for gas? The author isn't charging, so maybe the friend's occasional payment isn't required. The author is now stopping the free rides, which is their right. The friend might expect some consistency, but the author can choose when to offer rides. \n\nThe friend's action of putting gas once when the purse was left might be a gesture, but the author isn't obligated to continue providing rides without compensation. The author could feel that their friend isn't contributing, so ending it isn't wrong. \n\nSo the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
