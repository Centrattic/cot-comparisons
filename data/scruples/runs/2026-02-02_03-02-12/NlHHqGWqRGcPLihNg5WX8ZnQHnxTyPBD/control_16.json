      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about ending free rides for a friend. The friend usually gets rides in the author's car, and the author fills up the tank and picks them up/drops them off. The friend only put gas once when the author forgot their purse. Now, the author is asking if they're an asshole for telling the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms of shared expenses. If the author is covering all the gas costs, and the friend has never contributed before, but suddenly the friend puts in $10 once, is that enough? The author is ending the rides because the friend didn't pay gas before. Does the author have the right to set boundaries here? \n\nThe key points: The friend used the author's car hundreds of times without contributing. The one time they did put in $10 was after the author forgot their purse. The author is now saying the friend should find their own way. \n\nIs it fair for the author to expect some contribution for the gas? Probably. If the friend never helped with gas, maybe the author felt they were subsidizing the friend's transportation. When the friend finally did contribute once, the author might see that as a token amount and not consistent. So ending the rides could be seen as the author protecting their own resources. \n\nBut maybe the author should have communicated earlier if they wanted the friend to contribute. However, the friend only did so once, implying they didn't think they needed to. The author's response is to end the arrangement, which could be justified if they felt it was unfair. \n\nSo the author isn't in the wrong here. They're setting a boundary. The answer is B.\n"
