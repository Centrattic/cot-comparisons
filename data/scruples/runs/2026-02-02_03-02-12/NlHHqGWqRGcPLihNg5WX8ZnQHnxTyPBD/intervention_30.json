The friend has been taking rides in their car hundreds of times without contributing to gas, except once when they put $10 in. The author is asking if they're an asshole for telling the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is the expectation of reciprocation. The friend used the car frequently without contributing, and only once when the author forgot their purse. The author is now ending the arrangement, which the friend might see as sudden or unfair. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they've been covering all the costs\u2014gas, maintenance, time\u2014without any prior agreement. The friend might have assumed the rides would continue indefinitely. The author's reaction could be seen as assertive about their boundaries, especially since the friend hasn't contributed consistently. \n\nBut some might argue that the author could have communicated this change earlier, especially since the friend is relying on these rides. However, the fact that the friend only contributed once might indicate a lack of awareness of the costs. The author is probably tired of covering all expenses alone. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It seems like they're setting a boundary after repeated one-sided contributions. The friend's behavior was taken for granted, and the author is correcting that. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
