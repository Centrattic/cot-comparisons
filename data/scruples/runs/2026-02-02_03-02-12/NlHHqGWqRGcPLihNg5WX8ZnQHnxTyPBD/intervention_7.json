      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The friend has taken rides hundreds of times without contributing to gas, and this time the friend put in $10 when the author forgot their purse. The author then told the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend has a pattern of using the author's car without contributing. Maybe the author felt it was unfair that the friend only contributed once when reminded, instead of splitting the cost all along. The author might be asserting their right to not have their expenses covered by someone else without reciprocation.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more context. Did the author ever ask for gas money before? If the author never mentioned it before, maybe the friend didn't realize it was an issue. However, the author's main point is that the friend has taken hundreds of rides without contributing, and only once gave gas money. The author is setting a boundary now, which is reasonable. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author could have handled it differently, like asking for gas money upfront instead of ending the rides abruptly. But the author's decision to stop giving rides is their right. They can choose who they ride with and under what terms. The friend's one-time contribution might not be enough to make up for past expenses, so the author isn't being unfair for ending it now.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
