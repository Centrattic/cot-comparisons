      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who ended free rides for their friend is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend often rides in their car without contributing to gas. This time, the friend put $10 in gas when the author forgot their purse at home, and then the author told the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core issue here. The main points are about fairness and reciprocity. The friend has been using the author's car regularly without contributing, which might be seen as one-sided. The author is now ending the arrangement, possibly feeling it's unfair to always cover the gas costs. \n\nThe friend's action of putting $10 in gas might be seen as a one-time gesture, but the author's response is to stop the rides altogether. The question is whether the author overreacted. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if the friend has never contributed before, expecting a one-time contribution might not be reasonable. The author's car and time are their own, so they have the right to set boundaries. However, the abrupt end to the rides might come off as harsh, especially if the friend had just tried to contribute. \n\nBut considering the context, the author's stance could be justified. They might feel taken advantage of, especially if this is a long-term pattern. The friend's single act of putting gas might not make up for the hundreds of times they didn't. The author's right to set limits on their own resources is important here. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend's attempt to contribute, even if small, could be seen as a positive step. Ending the rides might seem like a disproportionate response if the friend was trying to be considerate. However, the author might feel that it's too late for that and that the friend should have contributed all along.\n\nSo, the key factors are: the pattern of one-sided usage, the sudden change in behavior from the friend, and the author's right to set boundaries. In many cases, people expect some level of reciprocity, especially when it comes to shared costs. If the friend never contributed before, the author's frustration is valid. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the free rides. They have the right to decide how their resources are used. The friend's one-time contribution doesn't erase the previous pattern. The answer would be B (No).\n"
