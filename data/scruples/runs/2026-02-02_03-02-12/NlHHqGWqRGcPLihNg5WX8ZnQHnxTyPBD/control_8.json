      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Ask a Therapist (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is about ending free rides for their friend. The friend has taken rides hundreds of times without contributing to gas, and when the author forgot their purse, the friend put in $10 for gas. Now the author is saying the friend should find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend always rode in the author's car, the author handles gas and the friend doesn't contribute usually. The one time the author forgot something, the friend put in $10. Now the author is ending the rides. The question is, is the author the asshole here?\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether it's reasonable for the author to expect the friend to contribute to gas. The author is ending the rides, which the friend has relied on for a long time. The friend only contributed once, which might not be enough to cover the costs over hundreds of rides. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're setting a boundary. The friend didn't contribute most of the time, so the author is just asking them to take responsibility. The friend might have expected to ride for free, but that's not fair. The author is ending the arrangement, which is their right. The friend should find another way. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
