      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who ended free rides in their car is in the wrong. The scenario is that their friend often rides with them, and the user fills up the gas. Last time, the friend put in $10 for gas when the user forgot their purse, and then asked for it back. The user is now saying the friend should find their own way around. The question is whether the user is an asshole (Answer A) or not (Answer B).\n\nFirst, I need to consider typical social norms regarding sharing car rides and expenses. Usually, when someone offers a ride, especially regularly, there's an unspoken understanding about who covers costs. If the friend has been taking rides hundreds of times without contributing, it might be reasonable for the user to expect some contribution, especially if it's causing them financial burden.\n\nIn this case, the friend did contribute $10 once, then asked for it back. That might suggest the friend didn't actually intend to pay, maybe just temporarily placing it or misunderstanding. The user might feel that since the friend hasn't contributed before, they're not willing to take responsibility for gas costs. By ending the rides, the user is setting a boundary, which could be seen as justified if the friend's behavior is taking advantage of the user's generosity.\n\nAnother angle: the user might have felt that the friend's one-time contribution wasn't genuine, especially if they got the money back. The user is then asserting that they can't keep covering all the costs and that the friend should arrange their own transportation. This is about setting limits, which is often necessary in relationships to prevent resentment.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the user should have discussed this earlier instead of just ending the rides. But the user might not have wanted to confront the friend repeatedly about gas money, leading to this decision to stop altogether.\n\nConsidering all this, the user's action seems like a reasonable boundary setting after repeated one-sided use of their resources. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
