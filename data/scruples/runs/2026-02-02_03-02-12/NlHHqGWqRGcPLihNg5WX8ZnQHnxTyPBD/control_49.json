      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about ending free rides for their friend. The friend always rides with them, the author fills up gas, picks them up and drops them off. Last weekend, the friend put $10 in gas because the author forgot their purse. Then the friend asked for the money back. The author then said the friend should find their way around in the future. The question is whether the author is wrong in ending the free rides.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are: the friend has ridden hundreds of times without contributing to gas, once they put $10 in when the author forgot their purse, then asked for it back. The author is upset and stops offering rides. The friend might feel that since they contributed once, the author is being unfair. But the author is frustrated because the friend never contributed before.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong? From the friend's side, they might have expected that contributing $10 would cover their share, but they had ridden for hundreds of times without paying. The author is ending the service because the friend isn't covering costs. The friend might not realize that one-time contribution isn't sufficient. The author's reasoning is that the friend isn't contributing, so they are within their right to stop. The friend might feel they did their part once, but the author is not obligated to provide rides for free. \n\nThe author isn't being unreasonable here. They set a boundary after the friend didn't contribute consistently. The friend's action of asking for money back after one contribution is also questionable. The author is not in the wrong because they are setting a boundary. So, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
