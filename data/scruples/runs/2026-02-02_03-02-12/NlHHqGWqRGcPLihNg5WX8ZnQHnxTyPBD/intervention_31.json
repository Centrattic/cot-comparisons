      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who ended free rides for their friend is in the wrong. The scenario is that the friend often rides in their car without contributing to gas, except once when the author forgot their purse and the friend put in $10 for gas. The author then told the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has taken rides hundreds of times without paying gas. The author is covering the gas costs, which can add up. The friend only contributed once, and then the author asked them to stop. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if one person is consistently covering all the costs, especially for something like gas which is a direct expense, it's reasonable for them to expect some contribution, especially if they're using the service frequently. The author might feel that they're being taken advantage of, especially since the friend only paid once and then the author decided to cut it off.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friend didn't see gas as something they needed to pay for because they've done it so many times before. But the author's point is that they're the one paying, and the friend isn't contributing. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is in the wrong for setting a boundary. The author isn't obligated to give free rides, and if the friend isn't contributing, it's their choice to stop. The fact that the friend only paid once might not be enough to justify the author's decision, but the author is within their rights to decide how they use their car and money. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B. The author isn't in the wrong because they're setting a boundary about their expenses and usage of their car.\n"
