Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author's friend always rides in their car, and the author fills up the gas and picks them up. This happened hundreds of times without the friend contributing. Last weekend, the author forgot their purse, and the friend put $10 in gas. Then the author told the friend to find their own way around. The question is whether the author is an asshole for ending the free rides.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend never contributed to gas before, only once when the author forgot their purse. The author is ending the rides, possibly because they feel taken advantage of. On the other hand, the friend might just be helping out in a small way after the incident. \n\nThe author's main point is about fairness. They've been providing a service (transportation) without compensation, and the friend only helped once. The author is asserting their boundaries now. \n\nIn AITA cases, it's important to look at both sides. The friend's occasional contribution might not be enough to justify the change in behavior. The author has the right to set boundaries, especially if they're feeling used. However, the friend might feel confused or upset about the sudden change. \n\nBut the fact that the author ended the rides after hundreds of free rides, except for one instance, shows that the author is taking a stand. They're not being unreasonable for wanting to stop if they're not comfortable with the arrangement anymore. \n\nSo, considering that the friend only contributed once out of hundreds of times, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the rides. They're reclaiming their personal choice and setting limits. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
