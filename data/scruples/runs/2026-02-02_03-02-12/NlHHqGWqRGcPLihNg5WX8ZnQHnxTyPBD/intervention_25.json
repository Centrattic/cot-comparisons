      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend has been getting rides in the author's car hundreds of times without contributing to gas. This time, the author forgot their purse and the friend put $10 in gas as a thank you. The author then told the friend to find their own way around in the future. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong and wants a confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's action is justified. The friend had been using the car ride as a free service, which could be seen as taking advantage. The author is the one providing the car, gas, and the ride. Even though the friend put gas money once, it's just one instance out of many. The author is setting boundaries now, which is reasonable. People can get frustrated if someone is always taking without giving back. The key here is whether the friend's actions were a one-time thing or a pattern. Since it's mentioned hundreds of times, the author is right to ask the friend to be responsible. The friend might be used to getting free rides and now is being held accountable. The author isn't being selfish; they're establishing limits. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
