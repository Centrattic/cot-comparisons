      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about ending free friend rides. The friend used to ride in the car for free, and after the author forgot their purse and the friend put in $10 for gas, the author decided to tell the friend to find their own way. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend has been using the author's car for rides without contributing to gas, hundreds of times. Then, once the author forgot their purse, the friend put $10 in gas. The author is upset that the friend didn't do this before and now is asking if they're an asshole for ending the free rides.\n\nSo, the key points: the friend took advantage of the author's generosity by not contributing to gas, and the author is ending the rides. The friend's one-time contribution of $10 is not making up for the previous times. The author is asserting their right to not have to cover all the costs alone.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, it's about mutual respect and responsibility. The author is setting a boundary, which is reasonable. The friend's expectation to ride for free without contributing is the issue here. The author isn't wrong for stopping the rides when the friend isn't covering their share. The friend should have contributed from the start, and the author is justified in ending the arrangement.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they are setting a boundary and the friend was taking advantage of a one-sided arrangement.\n"
