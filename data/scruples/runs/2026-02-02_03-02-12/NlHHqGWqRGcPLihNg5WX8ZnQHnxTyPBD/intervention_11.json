      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend regularly uses the author's car for rides, filling up the gas tank. The friend usually doesn't put gas back in, but this time he did after the author forgot their purse. The author then told the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been taking rides hundreds of times without contributing to gas. This time, after a specific incident where the author forgot their purse, the friend put in $10 for gas. The author is now ending the rides, which the friend might see as unfair, especially since it's the first time he contributed and the author is reacting strongly.\n\nThe key points here are about fairness and reciprocity. The friend's past behavior of not contributing to gas costs is a form of freeloading. The author is the one covering all the expenses, which can be costly over time. The friend's action of putting gas this time might be seen as a one-time gesture, not a consistent change. The author's response is to stop the rides, which could be justified as self-preservation to avoid ongoing expenses.\n\nHowever, the timing might be sensitive. The friend did contribute gas once, and the author's reaction might come across as harsh if it's the first time the friend tried to help. The author's tone in saying \"find your own way around\" could be perceived as abrupt. But considering the long history of the friend not paying, the author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary. The friend's past actions justify the author's decision, even if the timing of ending the rides might seem quick after one contribution. So, the answer is B.\n"
