      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending free friend rides. The situation is that the friend always rides with them, they fill up the gas, and the friend recently put $10 in gas when the author forgot their purse at home. The author then said the friend should find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author has been consistently giving rides, covering gas costs, and now the friend contributed once. The author is asking if they're an asshole for ending the rides. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the friend might have taken advantage, expecting free rides all the time. On the other, the author is setting a boundary after the friend finally contributed. \n\nBut the key here is whether the author is in the wrong. The friend's action of putting gas money in once might be seen as a small gesture, but the author is now refusing rides. Is that fair? The author has the right to set boundaries, especially if they feel taken for granted. The friend's past behavior could have been more considerate. \n\nAlso, the context is that the friend only put gas money in once when the author forgot their purse. That might not be consistent. So, the author's decision to stop giving rides could be justified as they're no longer accommodating a one-way relationship. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they are setting a boundary after feeling taken advantage of, and the friend's contribution was minimal compared to the ongoing favor.\n"
