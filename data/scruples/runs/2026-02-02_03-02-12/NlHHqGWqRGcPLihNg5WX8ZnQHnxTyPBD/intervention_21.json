The author's friend has been riding in their car a lot without contributing to gas. This time, the friend put $10 in gas because the author forgot their purse, and now the author is telling the friend to find their own way around. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but they want confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend has always ridden for free, but this time when the author forgot their purse (and presumably the money for gas), the friend put in $10. The author is upset and says they're done giving rides. The friend might feel that since they contributed once, maybe it's a sign of change or expectation for the future. But the author is ending the rides because of this one instance.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the friend has a history of not contributing, and only did so once when the author had a reason not to have money. The author is within their rights to set boundaries. People can't be expected to provide free services indefinitely. The friend might not be in a position to pay, but that's not the author's responsibility. The author isn't making a big deal out of one time the friend helped, but rather deciding to stop the arrangement. So the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
