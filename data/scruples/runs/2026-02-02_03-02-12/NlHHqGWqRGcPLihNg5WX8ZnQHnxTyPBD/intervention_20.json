      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about ending free rides for a friend. The friend has always taken rides in the author's car, with the author covering gas and making the trips. This time, the friend put $10 in gas because the author forgot their purse. Then the author told the friend to find their own way around in the future.\n\nThe user says they think the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics here. The friend has been getting rides for a long time without contributing to gas. It's possible the author felt taken advantage of, especially if they were covering all the costs. When the friend put in $10 this time, it might have been a gesture to help, but the author still decided to stop the rides. That could be seen as a boundary being set. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author had never mentioned the cost before and the friend didn't realize it was an issue, maybe the author should have communicated earlier. But the friend only contributed once, and the author still ended the arrangement. \n\nI think the key points are: the author provided rides and gas for a long time, the friend contributed once when asked, and the author decided to end the rides. The author isn't being unreasonable in setting a boundary, especially if the friend didn't contribute to costs before. The friend might have taken it for granted. So the author is probably not in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
