      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about ending free rides for a friend. The friend used to ride with them constantly, and now the author is telling them to find their own way around after the friend only put $10 in gas once when the author forgot their purse at home.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author has been giving their friend rides hundreds of times without payment, covering gas costs. The friend only contributed $10 once. The author is now cutting off the rides because the friend hasn't been contributing. The question is whether the author is an asshole for doing this.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author provided a service (rides) without compensation, the friend only contributed once, and the author is ending the arrangement. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong.\n\nIn terms of social norms, giving someone rides for free is a common kindness, especially among friends. However, when it becomes habitual and one-sided, it can be seen as taking advantage. The author is justified in setting boundaries if they feel their time and resources are being used without reciprocation. The friend putting in $10 once might not cover the actual cost of gas over multiple rides. The author's response to stop the rides is a way to enforce fairness, especially since the friend hasn't contributed consistently.\n\nThe friend's actions could be seen as taking the rides for granted. The author, by ending the rides, is asserting their right to not be taken advantage of. There's no indication that the author was asked to provide the rides; it's more about the friend relying on them. So, the author is within their rights to stop if they feel it's becoming a burden or unfair.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have communicated earlier or asked the friend to contribute more. But since the friend only did so once, it's understandable that the author is frustrated. The main issue is the lack of reciprocity. Since the author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary, the answer would be B (No).\n"
