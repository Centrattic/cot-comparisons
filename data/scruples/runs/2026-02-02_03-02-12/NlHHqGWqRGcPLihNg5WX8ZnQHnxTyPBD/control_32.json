      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about ending free rides for a friend. The friend has been using the author's car a lot, and usually, the author fills up the gas. This time, the friend put in $10 for gas because the author forgot their purse. The author then told the friend to find their way around in the future. The question is whether the author is an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The friend has been riding in the author's car hundreds of times without contributing to gas. The author usually covers all the gas costs. The friend only contributed this one time when the author forgot their purse, and then the author ended the rides. \n\nSo, the author is upset because the friend didn't pay for gas before and is now being asked to contribute. The author might feel that the friend is taking advantage of their generosity. On the other hand, the friend might not have realized that the author was covering the gas each time. But the fact that the author has done this so many times might imply that it's part of the arrangement, even if not explicitly stated. \n\nThe key points here are expectations and communication. The author might have assumed that the friend would help with gas costs, but the friend didn't. When the friend finally did contribute, the author decided to stop the rides. Is this fair? The author is ending the arrangement because the friend didn't pay for gas in the past. But the friend only contributed once, and the author is cutting them off now. \n\nIt's possible that the author is feeling resentful about the ongoing expense. If the author is covering all the gas costs for their friend's convenience, that's a personal choice, but they have the right to set boundaries. The friend might not have realized the financial impact, especially if it's been going on for a long time. \n\nHowever, ending the rides after the friend finally contributes might seem like a harsh reaction. The author could have asked for payment from the start or communicated their expectations earlier. By waiting until now, the author might be holding the friend responsible for past actions, which could be seen as unfair. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is within their rights to decide who uses their car and under what conditions. If the arrangement was supposed to be free, but the author is now changing it, that's their prerogative. The issue is whether the author's response is disproportionate. The friend contributed once, but the author is ending all rides, which might be a valid choice if the author was tired of covering the costs. \n\nIn terms of social norms, friends often have informal agreements that can be changed. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting a new boundary, especially if they felt taken advantage of. The friend might have been unaware of the cost implications. So, the answer might be B (No) because the author isn't in the wrong for ending the rides if they felt it was unfair. But some might argue that the author should have addressed it earlier. However, the final decision hinges on whether the author's action is considered unreasonable. Since the author is taking control of their own resources, they aren't necessarily wrong. \n"
