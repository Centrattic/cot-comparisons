      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The situation is about ending free friend rides because the friend only put gas in once when the author forgot their purse. The author is asking if they're an asshole for telling the friend to find their own way.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The friend regularly rides in the author's car without contributing to gas, except once. The author ends the arrangement because of that one instance. The key points here are the frequency of the friend's help versus the single act of contributing. \n\nThe friend has ridden hundreds of times without contributing gas. Only one time did they put in $10 when the author forgot their purse. The author is now ending the rides, possibly due to this inconsistency. \n\nSo, the main question is whether the author's reaction is justified. The friend's behavior is mostly taking without giving back, except once. The author's response is to stop helping entirely. \n\nIn terms of social norms, reciprocity is important. If someone consistently takes without giving, it can feel unfair. The author might feel that their effort (gas, time) isn't appreciated. However, the friend did contribute once, but the author is holding that one act against all the times they didn't. \n\nBut maybe the author is being a bit harsh. The friend's one act of putting gas could be a sign of awareness, but if the author expects regular contributions, then not getting them makes the author feel used. On the other hand, the friend might not be able to contribute regularly, or maybe they expected the author to cover it as part of the friendship. \n\nThe author's decision to end the rides might be seen as standing up for themselves, especially if they feel their resource (gas) is being consumed without contribution. However, the way it's framed\u2014only once\u2014is a small amount compared to the hundreds of times. So, the author might be overreacting. \n\nAlternatively, if the author never asked the friend to contribute, maybe the friend didn't realize they should. The author might have assumed it was a one-time thing. But the author is now cutting off rides because of that single instance. That could be seen as unfair, as the friend isn't the one who set the expectation. \n\nBut if the author felt that contributing gas was part of the arrangement, then the friend not doing so is a problem. However, since it's only once, maybe the author is being too strict. \n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) contexts, the community often looks at the balance of actions. If the friend is taking without giving back most of the time, the author has a valid point. But if the friend tried once and the author is penalizing them for not doing it consistently, maybe the author is overstepping. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the author communicated their expectations. If they never asked the friend to contribute, then the friend might not know they should. If the author did ask and the friend refused, that's different. But in this case, the friend only contributed once. The author might be in the right to say they can't keep doing this without more help. However, the friend might not have the means, or it's a cultural norm in their friendship. \n\nGiven that the author is upset about the lack of consistent contributions, and the friend only did it once, the author's decision to end it could be justified. But if the author didn't set clear boundaries from the start, they might be the asshole for ending it over a single instance. \n\nHmm. The key here is reciprocity. If the friend is only contributing once in hundreds of times, that's not reciprocal. The author is trying to correct that by ending the rides. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Alternatively, if the author never communicated that they wanted help with gas, it's their fault for not setting expectations. \n\nSince the friend put gas in once, maybe the author is being a bit unfair to demand help every time. But if the author expects regular contributions, then the friend isn't meeting that. The answer might hinge on whether the author communicated their expectations. Since the question doesn't mention that, we can assume the author didn't, so they might be in the wrong. \n\nWait, but the friend did put gas in once. The author's reaction is over a single instance. Maybe the author is being too harsh. The friend's action shows they care, but maybe not enough. The author could have asked for help more directly instead of ending the rides. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for being too strict. \n\nBut if the author is tired of the friend taking advantage, they have a point. It's a tough call. In AITA scenarios, the community often sides with the person who is setting boundaries. However, if the boundary isn't clear, the person might be in the wrong. \n\nIn this case, the author ends the arrangement because of one instance. If the friend never contributed before, maybe the author is justified. But the fact that the friend did contribute once might show that they are trying, even if not consistently. So the author's reaction might be too extreme. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they're setting a boundary after being taken advantage of. The friend's one act of putting gas isn't enough to counteract the hundreds of times they didn't. The author has the right to decide not to provide rides if the friend isn't contributing. However, there's a counterargument that the author didn't ask for contributions, so the friend didn't know. But given the context, I'm leaning towards B.\n"
