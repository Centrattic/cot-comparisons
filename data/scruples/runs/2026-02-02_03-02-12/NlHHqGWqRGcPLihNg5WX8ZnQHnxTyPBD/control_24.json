      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend often rides in their car, the author fills up the gas and picks them up. This time, the friend put $10 in gas because the author forgot their purse, and then later asked for it back. The author then said to find their way around in the future, and the question is whether that makes them an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend has been getting free rides for hundreds of times without contributing to gas. The author is covering all the expenses, including gas and the time/mileage. Now, when the friend did contribute $10 once, they asked for it back. The author is upset about that and decided to stop giving rides. \n\nSo, the core issues here are fairness and boundaries. The friend has been using the author's car without contributing, and now the author is setting a boundary. The friend's action of putting gas and then asking for it back might be a red flag. It's possible that the friend expected to cover the gas once but then wanted their money back, which could indicate a lack of understanding of the arrangement. \n\nThe author is ending the rides because they're tired of shouldering all costs. It's understandable that after hundreds of free rides, the author wants to stop. People have the right to set boundaries, especially when it comes to their own resources. The friend might not have realized the extent of the cost or the author's feelings about it. \n\nHowever, the friend might feel that since they contributed once, the author is being harsh. But the author's point is that the friend never contributed before. The act of contributing once and then asking for it back could be seen as insincere. The author's response is about ending the arrangement, which they have the right to do. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. They're setting a boundary after being taken advantage of. The answer should be B.\n"
