      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who ended free rides in their car is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend regularly rides with them, and the user fills up the gas. This time, the user forgot their purse at home, so the friend put $10 in gas to help. Then the user told the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The friend has relied on the user for rides many times without contributing. The user is the one handling all the costs, like gas and maintenance. When the user forgot their purse, the friend offered to help by putting in gas money, but maybe that was just a one-time gesture. The user then ended the arrangement, asking the friend to arrange their own transport.\n\nIs the user being unreasonable? Well, they've been covering all the costs up until now. The friend didn't contribute before, so the user might feel taken advantage of. The friend putting in $10 once isn't enough to make up for hundreds of free rides. The user is setting a boundary by saying no more free rides, which seems fair. The friend might have expected continued rides despite previous behavior, but the user is asserting their right to not be a chauffeur indefinitely. \n\nPossible angles: The user had the right to set boundaries after being used. The friend's one-time contribution isn't enough to justify the ongoing cost. The user is not obligated to provide free transportation. On the flip side, maybe the user should have been more appreciative of the friend's small gesture. But since the friend never contributed before, the user's frustration is valid. \n\nI think the key points are the friend's history of not contributing and the user setting a boundary after being taken advantage of. So the user isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
