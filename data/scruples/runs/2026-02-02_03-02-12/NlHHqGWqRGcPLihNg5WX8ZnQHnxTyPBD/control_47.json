      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ending free friend rides. The situation is that the friend often rides in their car for free, and when they forgot their purse, the friend put $10 in gas. The author then told the friend to find their own way around in the future.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The friend has used the author's car hundreds of times without contributing to gas. This time, the friend put $10 in gas. The author is upset about this and decided to stop giving rides. The question is whether the author is an asshole for doing so.\n\nSo, the main issue here is fairness and reciprocity. The friend has been using the car without contributing, which the author is now objecting to. The fact that the friend put $10 once might not be enough to offset hundreds of free rides. The author is asserting their right to not have to cover the friend's expenses every time. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if someone is using your car regularly without contributing, it's reasonable to expect some form of contribution, especially if it's affecting you (gas costs, wear and tear). The author is taking a stand, which could be seen as justified because they're setting boundaries. \n\nHowever, maybe the friend's $10 was a good gesture, but it's a drop in the bucket compared to the total cost. The author's response is to cut off rides entirely. Is that too harsh? Well, the author might feel that the friend isn't taking responsibility, so ending the rides is a way to make the friend take ownership. \n\nOn the other hand, some might say that the author should have communicated earlier about expecting gas contributions, rather than waiting until now. But the fact that the friend never contributed before makes the author's actions about correcting the imbalance. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're addressing a long-standing issue where their friend isn't contributing, and they're setting a boundary. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
