      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending free rides. The situation is that the friend usually rides in the author's car without contributing to gas, but once put in $10 after the author forgot their purse, and when asked back, the author told the friend to find their own way now. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author provides rides regularly, always covering the gas, and the friend hasn't contributed before. This time, after the gas contribution, the author is ending the rides. The question is whether the author is an asshole (ITA) for doing so.\n\nI should consider the context. The friend has a history of not contributing, but this one time did. Maybe the author feels it's unfair that the friend only helps when caught or as a one-time thing. The author is asserting their right to set boundaries. The friend might feel confused or upset because the author is ending it after that one contribution.\n\nBut is the author wrong? Well, the author isn't obligated to provide rides, so setting a boundary is reasonable. The friend's actions don't necessarily entitle them to continued rides. The author is just taking back their decision to offer rides, possibly because they feel the friend isn't genuinely contributing. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer would be B.\n"
