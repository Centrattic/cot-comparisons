      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about ending free rides for a friend. The friend has ridden in their car hundreds of times without contributing to gas, but this time they put in $10 when the author forgot their purse. The author then told the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The friend has been getting free rides regularly. The author has been covering all the gas costs. Now, when the friend finally offers to contribute once, the author ends the arrangement. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing so.\n\nThe key points here are about fairness and reciprocity. The author might feel that the friend is taking advantage of their generosity. The friend might feel that contributing $10 once is a small gesture, but the author is ending the rides entirely. The author's reaction could be seen as disproportionate if the friend had only offered to contribute once, but the prior behavior of not contributing at all is a big issue.\n\nHowever, the author is within their rights to stop offering rides if they feel it's unfair. It's their car and their money to spend as they see fit. The friend might not have realized the impact of their actions. The author's decision could be a way to set a boundary after feeling taken advantage of. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for ending the rides, especially if they were doing it out of a sense of fairness.\n"
