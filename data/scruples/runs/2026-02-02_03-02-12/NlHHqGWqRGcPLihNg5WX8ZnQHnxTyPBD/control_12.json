      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's friend has been taking rides in their car for a long time. The author fills up the gas themselves and picks up/drops off the friend. Recently, the friend put in $10 for gas because the author forgot their purse. Now the author is telling the friend to find their own way around in the future.\n\nThe key points here are about fairness and consistency. The friend has been getting free rides hundreds of times, and only once contributed when the author forgot their purse. The author is ending the arrangement because of this inconsistency. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the friend's contribution was a one-time thing, not a pattern. The author is asking them to cover the cost now. But the friend has never done this before. The author is setting boundaries after being taken advantage of. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friend didn't realize the cost was an issue. But the author didn't mention asking for payment before. Ending rides now might be a reaction to the friend's lack of contribution. \n\nBut the author is within their rights to set boundaries. They can decide who they give rides to and under what terms. The friend's one-time help doesn't negate the previous lack of contribution. The author is not obligated to continue providing rides without compensation or mutual agreement.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They're setting a boundary after the friend's pattern of not contributing.\n"
