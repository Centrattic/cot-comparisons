      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend has been riding in their car a lot, and the writer fills up the gas. Recently, the friend put $10 in gas because the writer forgot their purse at home. Now the writer is saying that the friend should find their way around in the future. The question is whether the author is an asshole (answer A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The friend has been getting free rides, and the writer is the one covering gas costs. The friend only contributed once when the writer forgot their purse. The writer is ending the rides, possibly expecting the friend to contribute more or not rely on them.\n\nThe key points to consider are: Is expecting some contribution from the friend reasonable? Has the friend been unfair in not contributing? The writer's actions are ending the rides, which is a reasonable response if they feel taken advantage of. The friend's behavior might be seen as parasitic, not contributing. The writer is asserting their own needs, which is a common theme in AITA posts where the person is standing up for themselves.\n\nBut, maybe the writer's tone is harsh? The friend might have expected some flexibility. However, the friend didn't contribute except once, so the writer's stance could be justified. Also, the writer is the one providing the service, so they have the right to set boundaries. The friend's repeated use without contribution might be the real issue here.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the person is often not the asshole if they're standing up for themselves when someone else has been taking advantage. The friend's actions (not contributing except once) might make them the one at fault. The writer's response is a way to stop the free-riding. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
