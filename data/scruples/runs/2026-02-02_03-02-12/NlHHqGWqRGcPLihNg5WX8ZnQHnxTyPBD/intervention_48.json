      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend has been getting rides in their car hundreds of times without contributing to gas. This past weekend, when the author forgot their purse at home, the friend put $10 into gas, and then later asked for it back. The author then told the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the friend's repeated use of the car without contributing, the one-time gas contribution that was later reclaimed, and the author's decision to stop providing rides. \n\nThe author's main complaint is about the friend taking advantage of their generosity. The friend putting in $10 might have been a one-time gesture, but then asking for it back might indicate that the friend wasn't actually trying to contribute but was just lending money. That could be seen as manipulative. The author is setting a boundary by stopping the rides, which is a personal choice. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if someone is using your resources (like your car and gas) repeatedly without contributing, it's reasonable to set limits. The author isn't being selfish; they're recognizing that their friend isn't respectful of their time or costs. The friend's behavior of asking for the money back after putting it in might even show a lack of genuine effort to help, which could justify the author's decision. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author should be more understanding, especially if the friend is in a tough spot. But the scenario doesn't mention any extenuating circumstances for the friend. The author isn't cutting off all contact, just ending the free rides. \n\nSo, based on the information given, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their right to not be taken advantage of. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
