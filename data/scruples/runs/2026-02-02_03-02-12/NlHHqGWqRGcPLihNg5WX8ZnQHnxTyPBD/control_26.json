      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. So the person is asking if they're an asshole for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that their friend always rides in their car, they fill up the gas, pick him up, drop him off. This time, the friend put $10 in gas because the author forgot their purse. Then the friend asked for it back. The author is saying that the friend has ridden in the car hundreds of times without putting gas, and now they're telling the friend to find his way around in the future. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So the friend has been using the author's car and gas for a long time without contributing, but this one time he did put in $10. Then he asked for the money back. The author is upset about that and decides to stop giving rides. \n\nFirst, I need to consider if the friend's actions were reasonable. Putting $10 in gas is a small gesture, but asking it back might be seen as not appreciating the gesture. If the friend has never contributed before, maybe he's just trying to make up for it now. But the author is tired of the one-sided arrangement. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author is setting boundaries. If the friend has been using their car and gas without contributing, the author has every right to stop. The friend's asking for the money back might have been a trigger. It's possible that the author felt disrespected by the friend's request, leading them to end the rides. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have communicated their feelings sooner. But since the friend's request was the last straw, it's understandable. The author isn't obligated to subsidize the friend's transportation indefinitely. So the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
