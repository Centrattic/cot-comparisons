      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend often rides in their car, and the author fills up the gas and picks them up. Last weekend, the friend put $10 in gas because the author forgot their purse and asked for it back. The author is now saying the friend should find their own way around in the future. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The friend has used the author's car hundreds of times without contributing to gas. Then, once the author forgot their purse and asked for it back, the friend put $10 in gas. The author is now ending the free rides. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is being unreasonable. From the description, the friend's contribution was only once, and the author is ending the arrangement after that. But maybe the author is within their rights to set boundaries after that incident. \n\nThe key points: The author has been providing rides without payment up to this point. The friend contributed once when asked for a purse, but that's not the same as a regular contribution. The author is ending the rides because the friend hasn't been contributing to gas regularly. \n\nIn many AITA cases, friends expect some level of mutual benefit. If the author is covering all costs (gas, car maintenance, etc.) and the friend isn't contributing, the author is within their rights to stop. The fact that the friend put $10 once might be a gesture, but if the author expected ongoing contributions and the friend hasn't provided them, ending the rides makes sense. \n\nHowever, maybe the friend's single $10 contribution was a one-time thing, and the author is now holding it against them. But from the author's perspective, they might feel that their friend isn't contributing to the cost of the rides. So the author is setting a boundary, which is reasonable. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
