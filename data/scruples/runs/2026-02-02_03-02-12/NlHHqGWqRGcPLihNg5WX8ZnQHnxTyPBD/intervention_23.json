      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ending free friend rides in their car.\n\nSo the situation is: the author's friend frequently rides with them, and they handle gas and pickups. The friend usually doesn't put gas in the car but once did after the author forgot their purse. The author then told the friend to find their own way around. The question is whether the author is an asshole for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author has been accommodating, filling up gas and picking up the friend regularly. The friend has taken advantage of this for a long time. The one instance where the friend contributed was when the author forgot their purse, but maybe that was out of necessity rather than a sudden awareness of responsibility. The author is probably feeling that it's unfair to always be the one covering the costs and effort, especially since the friend hasn't done it before. \n\nIs there an expectation of reciprocity here? If the friend has never contributed and the author is now setting boundaries, is that reasonable? The author isn't being asked to do this indefinitely, and they're asking the friend to be independent. The friend might feel they're being cut off, but the author might feel they've been overstepping. \n\nLooking at similar cases, when someone stops accommodating a friend who hasn't been contributing, it's usually seen as the friend being inconsiderate for not contributing and the person setting boundaries being justified. However, the timing of the friend putting gas in might be a red herring, since it was a one-time thing. The author's main issue is the ongoing free rides. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries, especially when the friend hasn't been contributing. The friend's one-time action doesn't negate the long-term lack of reciprocity. The author is just ending a situation where they've been shouldering all the responsibility without much help.\n"
