      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend has taken rides in the author's car hundreds of times without contributing to gas, except once when the author forgot their purse and the friend put in $10. The author then told the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the fairness here. The key points are the frequency of the rides and the one-time contribution. The friend has essentially been using the author's car as a personal taxi without any prior payment. The $10 was a one-time thing, possibly due to the author's oversight, not a regular contribution. \n\nThe author is asking if they're an asshole for ending the rides. From a fairness standpoint, when someone consistently uses a resource without contributing, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The friend's one-time contribution doesn't offset the hundreds of times they didn't pay. So the author's decision to stop the rides isn't unreasonable. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should have communicated earlier or found a different solution, like splitting gas costs each time. But the fact that the author only mentions the friend contributing once, and that was after a mistake, suggests that the friend never took responsibility for their share. The author's right to set limits on how their car is used is valid. \n\nAnother angle is the relationship between the two. If they're close friends, maybe there's an understanding of mutual support, but it's also about respecting personal resources. The author isn't obligated to provide rides indefinitely without reciprocity. \n\nSo considering all that, the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to decide how their car is used and to stop if the arrangement is one-sided.\n"
