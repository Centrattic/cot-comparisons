      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of a \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for ending free rides for a friend. The situation is that the friend has always taken rides in the author's car without contributing to gas, except once when the friend put $10 in gas because the author forgot their purse. The author then told the friend to find their own way around. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The friend has been using the author's car for rides repeatedly without paying for gas. That seems like a one-sided arrangement where the author is shouldering all the costs. The friend's act of putting $10 in gas this time was in response to the author forgetting the purse. The author is now saying to find their own way, which the user is defending.\n\nI should consider the concept of fairness in shared costs. If the friend has never contributed before, suddenly doing so once might not be enough. The author might feel that the friend only contributes when there's a personal gain (getting the purse back), which could be seen as opportunistic.\n\nAlso, the question is about whether the author is an asshole for ending the rides. The author is setting a boundary, which is a common reason people ask about in these forums. Boundaries are important, and if someone is taking without giving back, it's reasonable for the author to want to stop. The friend's behavior might be taken for granted, and the author is asserting their own needs.\n\nHowever, maybe the friend's single act of contributing could be a sign of wanting to start paying their share. The author's response might be harsh if the friend was just trying to be considerate. But given the history, the author has a right to expect fairness. The initial $10 might not be sufficient if the friend continues to ride without contributing in the future.\n\nAnother angle: the author might be feeling used or like their generosity is being exploited. Ending the rides when they feel the friend isn't reciprocating could be a justified reaction. The friend might not have a car, so the author is providing a necessary service, but that doesn't mean it's fair to do it for free, especially if it's frequent.\n\nIn terms of community norms for AITA, usually, people who set boundaries after being taken advantage of are seen as not the asshole. The friend's lack of contribution beyond one time could be the issue here. The author isn't wrong for asking for reciprocation or ending the arrangement if their friend isn't willing to share the costs.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They are setting a boundary after the friend's one-time contribution, which might not be enough given the history. The friend should have been contributing all along, and the author's request for them to find their own way is a reasonable response to stop being taken advantage of.\n"
