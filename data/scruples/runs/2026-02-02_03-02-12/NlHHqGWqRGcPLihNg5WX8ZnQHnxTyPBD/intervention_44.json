      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author ends free rides for their friend. The friend usually rides with the author, and the author fills up the gas. This time, the friend put $10 in gas because the author forgot their purse. The author then told the friend to find their own way around. The user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The friend has taken rides hundreds of times without contributing to gas. This time, the friend added $10. The author is upset that the friend only contributed when they forgot their purse, which seems like an excuse to get the gas money back. The author is ending the rides, saying the friend should find their own way. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the friend is using the author's car repeatedly without contributing to the cost. Gas is a recurring expense, and expecting someone to cover that without contribution can be unfair. The friend only added money this time under the pretense of returning the purse. That might be seen as a one-time gesture rather than a commitment. The author's decision to stop this arrangement could be justified because the friend hasn't consistently contributed. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author didn't communicate their expectations beforehand. If they had mentioned the gas cost up front, the friend might have contributed more regularly. But in reality, people might assume it's a free ride unless specified. The friend's action of adding $10 this time might not be enough to cover the ongoing costs, especially if the author is covering the gas every time. \n\nThe author's response of ending the rides could be a reasonable boundary. They're asserting that their resources (gas) aren't free, and the friend needs to take responsibility. Alternatively, maybe the author could have asked the friend to contribute in other ways or set expectations earlier, but in this case, it seems like the author is standing their ground. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is not in the wrong. They're setting a boundary after the friend's one-time contribution. The friend's pattern of not contributing previously makes the author's decision justified. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
