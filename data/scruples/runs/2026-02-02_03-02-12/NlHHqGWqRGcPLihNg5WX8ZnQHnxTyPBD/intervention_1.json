      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The friend often rides with them, and this time when the author forgot their purse, the friend put $10 in gas. The author then said the friend should find their own way around now.\n\nSo the friend has used the car a lot without contributing to gas. The author is upset that they have to cover all the costs and is ending the rides. The key points here are about fairness, contribution, and expectations in the friendship.\n\nFirst, the friend's previous behavior: they rode in the car hundreds of times without adding gas. That seems like they took advantage of the author's generosity. The author might have felt it's unfair to cover all the gas costs for someone else's convenience. When the author forgot their purse, the friend put $10 in gas. Maybe the author expected this to be a regular thing, but the friend only did it once. The author then decided to stop the rides, which the friend might see as being overly strict or not appreciating the one time they contributed.\n\nDoes the author have the right to expect contributions? If the author didn't ask for it before, but the friend occasionally paid for gas, maybe the author's expectation was low. However, the friend's consistent lack of contribution over hundreds of rides could justify the author's frustration. The author is setting boundaries now, which is reasonable. The friend might feel blindsided, but the author isn't wrong for wanting to stop something that's costing them money.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't mention asking the friend to contribute before, so the friend might not have known. But the author could have communicated their expectations earlier instead of ending it abruptly. However, the main issue is the friend's past behavior of not contributing. The author is within their rights to stop if they feel it's unfair. So the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
