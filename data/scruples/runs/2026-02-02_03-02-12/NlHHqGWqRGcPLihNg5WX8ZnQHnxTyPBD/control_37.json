      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend has been taking rides in the author's car many times without contributing to gas, but this time they put in $10 for gas because the author forgot their purse. The author then told the friend to find their own way around in the future.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend has a history of using the author's car without paying for gas. The author mentions they've given hundreds of free rides. Then, in one instance, the friend contributed $10 when the author forgot their purse. The author is now being asked if it's right to end the free rides after that one contribution.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about fairness and boundaries. The author might feel that the friend is taking advantage of them by not paying for gas regularly. The friend, on the other hand, might have felt bad in that specific case and offered to contribute, which doesn't necessarily mean they'll do it consistently. \n\nThe author's action was to set a boundary by saying the friend should find their own way. The question is whether that's justified. In general, if someone is using your resources (like car and gas) without contributing, it's reasonable to expect them to help with the costs, especially if it's a frequent occurrence. The friend's one-time contribution might have been a response to the situation where the author forgot their purse, which could have made the friend realize they were being a freeloader. \n\nBut does the author have the right to end rides altogether after that one time? Maybe the friend tried to be considerate once but hasn't made it a regular practice. The author might be punishing the friend for past behavior rather than the current instance. However, the author could argue that they're setting a precedent and enforcing a rule now that the friend has started to pay. \n\nI think the key here is the pattern of behavior. The friend didn't pay for gas hundreds of times before, so the author is within their rights to expect some contribution. The friend's one-time payment might have been a good gesture, but it's not enough to absolve the previous behavior. The author's response is about maintaining boundaries and ensuring that future rides are accounted for. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they're finally setting a rule that the friend should help with gas costs. The friend might not have realized there was an expectation before, and the author is just being fair now. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the friend's single act of putting gas was enough and the author is overreacting. But given the context of hundreds of free rides, it's reasonable for the author to establish a boundary. So, I'm leaning towards the answer being B, No, the author is not in the wrong. They have a right to expect their friend to contribute to the costs when using their car regularly.\n"
