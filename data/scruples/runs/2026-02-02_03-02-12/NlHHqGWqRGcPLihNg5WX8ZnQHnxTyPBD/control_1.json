      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" situation is in the wrong for ending free friend rides.\n\nSo the situation is: The friend has been riding in the author's car a lot. The author fills up the gas tank, picks up the friend, and drops him off. This past weekend, when the author forgot their purse, the friend put $10 in gas, and then asked the author back for it. The author is now saying they should find their own way around in the future. The author is asking if they're an asshole for ending the free rides.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The friend has used the author's car hundreds of times without contributing to gas. The only time the friend contributed was when the author forgot their purse and the friend put in $10. Then the friend asked for the money back. The author is ending the rides because the friend only contributed once and now is being asked for it back.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? The friend has been taking advantage, not contributing to gas, and now when they did contribute once, they want it back. The author is setting a boundary. In most cases, if someone is using your resources (like gas) without contributing, it's reasonable to set a boundary. The friend's request for the $10 might be seen as a way to get back the money they put in, but the author is ending the rides entirely. However, the author is not wrong for doing so because the friend hasn't been contributing. The author is justified in asking for compensation when it's needed, and ending the rides if the friend is not willing to contribute. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
