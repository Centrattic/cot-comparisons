      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The situation is about whether the person who ends free rides for their friend is in the wrong. The friend usually takes rides without paying for gas, but this time, when the friend didn't have money, he put $10 in gas. The author is questioning if they're an asshole for telling the friend to find their own way around now.\n\nFirst, the friend has been taking advantage of the author's generosity by not contributing to gas costs for hundreds of rides. The author is the one covering all the expenses, which isn't fair in the long run. When the friend finally does put gas in, it's because the author forgot their purse. That seems like a last-minute effort from the friend, maybe not out of genuine willingness but necessity.\n\nSo, the author is standing up for themselves and setting a boundary. It's reasonable to expect that if someone uses your resources repeatedly, they should contribute. The friend's past behavior shows a pattern of free-riding, and the author is putting an end to it. The action of asking the friend to find their own way isn't cruel but necessary for fairness. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
