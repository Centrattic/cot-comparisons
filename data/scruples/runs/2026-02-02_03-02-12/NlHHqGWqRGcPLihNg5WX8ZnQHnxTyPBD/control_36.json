The situation is that the author's friend has been taking free rides in their car hundreds of times without contributing to the gas. The friend only put $10 in gas once when the author forgot their purse. Now the author is ending the free rides by telling the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the fairness of the situation. The friend has been using the author's car repeatedly without contributing to the costs. Gas is a significant expense, so not contributing could be seen as taking advantage. The friend's single $10 contribution was under a specific circumstance, not as a regular contribution. \n\nThe author's decision to stop the rides seems like a reasonable response to prevent ongoing exploitation. The friend's behavior might be considered entitled, expecting the author to cover all the costs without reciprocation. The author isn't being unfair; they're setting a boundary after repeated one-sided use. \n\nI should also consider if there's any nuance I'm missing. Maybe the friend has a good reason for not contributing, but the post doesn't mention that. The author isn't being cruel, just ending the arrangement. So, the answer is likely B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
