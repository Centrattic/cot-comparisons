      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ending free friend rides. The situation is that the friend always rides in their car, the author fills up the tank, and the friend usually doesn't contribute to gas. But this time, the friend put in $10 when the author forgot their purse, and then asked for it back. The author then decided to tell the friend to find their own way in the future.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the dynamics here. The main points are about fairness and reciprocity. The author has been providing rides consistently without compensation, which might be a mutual understanding. However, the friend only contributed once, and the author feels it's unfair. The author's response is to stop giving rides. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. In these kinds of situations, it's important to consider both sides. The author has a right to set boundaries, especially if they feel they're shouldering all the costs. The friend's contribution was minimal and possibly out of obligation when they asked for their purse back. The author might feel that the friend isn't considering their expenses. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might feel that the occasional help is enough. But the author's decision to stop rides could be seen as a reasonable boundary if they're uncomfortable with the arrangement. There's no indication the author was forced to do this; they chose to offer rides before. So ending it now is their prerogative.\n\nIn many AITA scenarios, the key is whether the action is a proportionate response. Here, the author is ending the rides after one instance of the friend paying. The fact that the friend didn't pay before might justify the author wanting reciprocity. The author isn't asking for payment but to stop using their car. That seems fair. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). It's about personal boundaries and the author has the right to change their mind about providing rides, especially if they're not happy with the current arrangement.\n"
