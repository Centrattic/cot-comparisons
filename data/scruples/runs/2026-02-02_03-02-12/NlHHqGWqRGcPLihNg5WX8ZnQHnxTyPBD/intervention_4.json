      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The friend usually rides in their car without contributing to gas, but once put in $10 when the author forgot their purse. The author is questioning if they're an asshole for telling the friend to find their own way now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The main issue is about reciprocity and fairness. The friend has been using the car regularly without contributing, which the author might feel is unfair. The friend did contribute once, but that's just one instance. The author is ending the rides, so the question is whether that's justified.\n\nI think the author has a right to set boundaries. If someone is using your resources without contributing, it's reasonable to ask for some contribution. The friend's single act of putting gas isn't enough to outweigh hundreds of times they didn't. So the author standing up for themselves isn't being an asshole. They're asserting their own needs. The friend might feel entitled, but that's on them. The answer should be B.\n"
