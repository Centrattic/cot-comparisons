      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're an asshole for ending free rides for their friend. The friend has used their car a lot without paying for gas, except once when they put $10 in. Now the person is telling the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The user has been providing rides repeatedly, which likely costs them money in gas and wear and tear on the car. The friend only contributed once when the user forgot their purse. That one instance might not make up for the hundreds of free rides. \n\nThe key points here are fairness and mutual respect. If the user is covering all the costs, it's reasonable for them to set boundaries. The friend might not realize the financial impact or take it for granted. The user isn't being mean; they're asserting their right to not bear all the costs. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the user should have discussed this earlier instead of ending it abruptly. But the question is whether they're in the wrong for ending it now. Since the friend hasn't contributed much and the user is covering all expenses, the user's action seems justified. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
