      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend has been riding in their car hundreds of times without contributing to gas, but when the author forgot their purse and the friend put in $10 for gas, the author responded by telling the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has been providing a service (rides) without any contribution from the friend until this one instance. The friend did contribute once, but the author still decided to end the rides. The key issue here is whether the author is justified in doing so after just one instance of the friend contributing, especially when the friend had a valid reason (the author forgot their purse).\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author might feel that the friend isn't contributing their share, but the friend's action of putting in $10 was in response to a specific situation. The author's response seems a bit harsh because the friend did make an effort once. However, the author might be frustrated after many instances of no contribution. It's possible that the author is setting boundaries, which is reasonable, but the timing after just one act of contribution could be seen as a bit abrupt.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend has a history of not contributing, so maybe the author is within their rights to expect payment going forward. The fact that the friend put money in once doesn't necessarily mean they've changed their habit. The author might be trying to correct the imbalance, which is a valid reason. However, the author could have approached it differently, perhaps by discussing it rather than cutting off rides completely.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common for people to split gas costs when sharing rides. The author might be enforcing that norm here. The friend's past behavior of not contributing could be seen as taking advantage, so the author's decision to stop providing free rides isn't unreasonable. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They might just be setting boundaries after being taken advantage of for some time.\n"
