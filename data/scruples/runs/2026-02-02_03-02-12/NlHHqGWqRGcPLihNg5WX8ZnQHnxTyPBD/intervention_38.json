      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ending their friend's free rides. The situation is that the friend often rides in their car, gets gas put in, but only once contributed when the author forgot their purse. The author is now asking if they're an asshole for telling their friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The friend has ridden in the car hundreds of times without contributing to gas, except once. The author is ending the rides because the friend didn't help with gas. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong for setting this boundary.\n\nFrom the information given, the author is the one providing the service\u2014driving, filling up gas, picking up and dropping off. The friend has been using this service without contributing, except once. The author is now asserting their right to stop this arrangement. \n\nIn terms of fairness, it's reasonable for the author to expect some reciprocation or contribution, especially since they're covering the costs. The fact that the friend only contributed once when the author forgot their purse might be a one-time gesture, not a regular contribution. The author's decision to end the rides could be seen as standing up for their own boundaries and not wanting to subsidize the friend's transportation indefinitely.\n\nHowever, maybe the friend didn't realize the cost was an issue. But the author hasn't mentioned discussing the expectations beforehand. If the author never communicated that contributing to gas was necessary, maybe the friend didn't know. But in this case, the author is ending it after 10 instances where the friend didn't contribute, except once. The author is within their rights to stop allowing the rides if they feel it's unfair. \n\nSo the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the author is setting a personal boundary and has the right to choose who they spend time and money on. The friend's free-riding might be the real issue here, and the author is just taking a stand.\n"
