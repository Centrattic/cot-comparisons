      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the friend has used the car a lot, always getting rides without contributing to gas. The writer mentions they fill up the tank and pick the friend up, drop him off safely. Then, one time, the friend put in $10 for gas because the writer forgot their purse. After that, the writer asked the friend to find his own way around in the future. The question is whether the writer is an asshole for doing that.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about fairness and expectations. The writer is the one providing the car, the gas, the time, and the friend has taken that for granted. The friend only contributed once when it was an oversight. The writer is now asking the friend to be independent, which seems reasonable. \n\nBut wait, maybe the friend thought the rides were a given? If the writer never set boundaries before, maybe the friend didn't realize they should pay for gas. However, the writer is the one who's been handling all the costs. It's their car and their money. The friend isn't being forced to ride; they can choose other means of transport. \n\nThe act of ending the free rides isn't punishment for the one time the friend paid. The writer is asking for the friend to take responsibility. So, the writer isn't being unkind here. They're setting a boundary. Unless there was an agreement before that gas would be covered, the writer isn't in the wrong. The friend might be in the wrong for not contributing, but the writer is just correcting that. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the writer is enforcing their own limits. It's their car and money, and it's reasonable to expect the friend to contribute or find their own way.\n"
