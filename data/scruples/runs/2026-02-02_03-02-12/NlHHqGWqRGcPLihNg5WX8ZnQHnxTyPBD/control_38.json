      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post (the author) is in the wrong for ending free friend rides. Let me read the situation again.\n\nThe author's friend always rides in their car, filling up the tank and dropping the friend off. The friend put gas in this past weekend because the author forgot their purse. Then the author said the friend should find their own way around. The question is whether the author is an asshole (AITA) for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend usually rides for free, but this time, they contributed gas money. The author might have felt taken advantage of because the friend never paid before. The author's response was to stop giving rides, which could be seen as cutting off a favor they've provided many times.\n\nBut wait, the author mentions that the friend put gas in this time because they forgot their purse. Maybe the friend was trying to be helpful or make up for something. The author's reaction is to stop giving rides entirely. Is that fair?\n\nOn one hand, the author could feel that the friend is used to free rides and didn't expect them to contribute. On the other hand, the author might be ending the rides because they want the friend to contribute, which is reasonable. But the friend only contributed once, not as a regular thing. The author is making a big change based on a one-time action. That might be overreacting.\n\nAlso, the author is asking if they're an asshole. The friend has a history of not contributing, so the author might be justified in asking for reciprocity. However, ending all rides because the friend contributed once might not be the best approach. A better approach might be to ask for gas money going forward, but instead, they just cut it off. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether their reaction was proportional. The friend's action was a one-time contribution, but the author is ending the rides. That could be seen as harsh, especially if the friend was trying to be helpful. However, if the author felt taken advantage of all along and finally had enough, maybe not. But the friend didn't ask for a ride this time; the author ended it preemptively. \n\nHmm. Maybe the author is not in the wrong because they have the right to set boundaries. However, the way they did it might come off as abrupt. But considering the friend's history, the author's decision to ask the friend to find their own way is a valid boundary. So the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
