      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending free friend rides. The scenario is that the friend regularly uses the author's car for rides, the author fills up the gas, picks up and drops off the friend. Then, once, when the author forgot their purse, the friend put $10 in gas. The next day, the author asked the friend back for it. The friend had ridden hundreds of times without paying, so the author is now telling them to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about fairness and expectations. The friend has been taking advantage of the author's generosity by using their car and gas repeatedly without contributing. The author is now setting a boundary after the friend made a one-time contribution. \n\nThe friend's action of putting in $10 is a new behavior, but it's after hundreds of free rides. The author is asking for that $10 back, which seems fair because the friend didn't do that before. The author's statement to find their own way implies they're done allowing the friend to ride for free. \n\nIs the author being selfish or is this a reasonable boundary? The author is reclaiming their own resources. The friend's behavior was a free ride, and the author is now asserting their right to not be taken advantage of. \n\nIn many cases, unpaid favors can lead to resentment if the balance isn't maintained. The author might have felt it was time to stop the free rides, especially after the friend contributed once. The fact that the friend didn't contribute before could indicate a pattern of taking without giving. The author is now asking for the $10 and ending the arrangement, which is a form of setting a boundary. \n\nThere's no indication that the author is being unreasonable here. They are not demanding payment for all past rides, just the recent one. Ending the free rides is a way to stop the exploitation. So, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B."
