      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is about ending free rides for a friend. The friend has taken rides hundreds of times without contributing to gas, and when the author forgot their purse, the friend put $10 in gas. Then the author told the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author provided rides regularly, which involved filling up gas and picking up the friend. The friend only contributed once when the author forgot the purse. The author is now ending the rides. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by doing so.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author isn't obligated to provide rides. The friend's contribution of $10 was a one-time thing, not regular. The author might have felt that the friend wasn't contributing to the costs, leading to resentment. Ending the rides could be seen as the author setting a boundary, which is reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the friend was relying on the author for transportation and that the one-time $10 wasn't sufficient. However, the friend had a history of not contributing, so the author might feel justified in stopping the rides to avoid being taken advantage of.\n\nThe author's statement to \"find your way around in the future\" is a clear boundary. The friend's action of putting $10 might have been a reaction to the author's forgotten purse, not a regular contribution. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for ending the arrangement, especially if they felt it was one-sided.\n\nSo, considering the context and the lack of consistent contribution from the friend, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
