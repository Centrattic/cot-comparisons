      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend has been riding in their car hundreds of times without contributing to gas, but this past weekend the friend put $10 in gas. The author then told the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The main point is whether the author is justified in stopping the rides after the friend contributed once after so many free rides. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know if I agree.\n\nSo, the friend has been using the car regularly without paying gas. That seems like an imbalance in the friendship. The author is the one covering all costs. Then, the friend puts in $10 after the author forgot their purse. That might be the first time the friend contributed. The author then ends the ride, telling the friend to find their own way.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if the author is consistently covering all the costs of gas, it's reasonable to expect some contribution, especially if the rides are frequent. The friend's one-time $10 might not be enough, but the author could be frustrated. The author's response is to stop giving rides entirely. Is that a proportional reaction?\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to set boundaries. If they feel exploited, it's reasonable to say something. The fact that the friend only contributed once after so many times might be the breaking point. The author isn't obligated to keep giving free rides if they don't want to.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have handled it differently. Instead of cutting off rides completely, they could have asked the friend to contribute more regularly. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not whether their method of handling it is the best approach. The author's action is to stop the rides, and the question is about that decision.\n\nSo, if the author is tired of covering all the costs and decides to stop, that's their right. The friend didn't contribute until now, which might not be enough. The author isn't in the wrong for setting that boundary. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
