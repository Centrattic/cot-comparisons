      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend has been riding in their car hundreds of times without contributing to gas, but this time put $10 in gas when the author forgot their purse. The author then told the friend to find their own way around from now on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness here. The friend used the author's car many times without paying for gas, which is a recurring expense. The author is covering the cost of the gas each time, and the friend only contributed once when reminded. The author's decision to stop giving rides makes sense because it's about setting boundaries when someone is taking without contributing.\n\nThe key points are: 1) The friend has a history of not paying for gas. 2) The friend only contributed this one time when prompted. 3) The author is now asking the friend to find their own transportation. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author isn't obligated to provide free rides indefinitely, especially when it's a financial burden. The friend's one-time contribution might not be sufficient if the author has a long history of covering all the costs. It's reasonable for the author to decide that they don't want to bear the expense alone. \n\nAlso, the situation mentions that the author fills up the tank and picks up the friend, which implies regular use. If the friend is using the car frequently, the gas costs add up. The author might feel that it's unfair to keep covering these costs without any contribution from the friend. The friend's action of putting in $10 could be seen as a small token, but if the rides are frequent, that amount might not even cover a fraction of the actual expenses. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's common for people to feel that they have the right to set boundaries, especially regarding their own resources. The author isn't being unreasonable by asking the friend to take responsibility for their own transportation now. It's about mutual respect and fairness in the friendship. \n\nSo, based on these points, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to expect some contribution from the friend, especially after repeated use of their car. The friend's lack of prior contribution and the author's decision to stop the rides is a reasonable response to an unfair situation.\n"
