      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for ending free rides. The situation is that their friend always gets rides in their car, but this time the friend put $10 in gas because the author forgot their purse. Then the author told the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has used the car hundreds of times without contributing to gas. This time, even though the friend put in $10, the author felt justified in ending the free rides. \n\nThe key points here are the frequency of the rides and the sudden change in the friend's behavior. The friend only contributed once after hundreds of free rides. The author might feel that this single contribution isn't enough to make up for the long-term cost. \n\nAlso, the reason the friend contributed was because the author forgot their purse, which might not be a valid reason for the friend to start paying now. The author is asking if they're an asshole for ending the rides. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the friend has never contributed before and only did so once under specific circumstances, the author is within their right to set boundaries. The author isn't obligated to provide free rides indefinitely. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong (B) because they have the right to decide who uses their resources and under what conditions. The friend's one-time contribution doesn't erase the prior history of free rides, and the author can choose to stop the arrangement without being an asshole.\n"
