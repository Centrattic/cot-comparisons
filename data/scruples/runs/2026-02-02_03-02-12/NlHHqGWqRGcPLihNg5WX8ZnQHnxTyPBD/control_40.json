      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about ending free rides for their friend. The friend has been getting rides hundreds of times without contributing gas money, and when the author forgot their purse, the friend put in $10 for gas. Now, the author is telling the friend to find their own way around. The question is whether the author is an asshole for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context better. The friend has been using the author's car regularly without contributing. The author might be feeling that it's unfair for the friend to not help with gas costs. When the friend finally does contribute after the author had a problem (forgetting the purse), the author ends the arrangement. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, maybe they felt taken advantage of. They've been covering all the costs, and the friend's occasional contribution isn't enough. The author might be asserting their boundaries, which is a reasonable thing to do. People have different expectations about what's fair in friendships. If the author didn't set this boundary earlier, maybe the friend didn't realize it was an issue. But once the author decides to stop, it's their car and their choice.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might feel that $10 was a gesture to help out, and the author's response is too harsh. But the friend had been riding for hundreds of times without contributing. The author isn't obligated to provide rides, especially if it's causing them financial strain. \n\nSo, considering the situation, the author is setting a boundary after the friend's inconsistent behavior. The friend didn't contribute before, so the $10 might not be enough to change the pattern. The author's decision to stop is about their own comfort and fairness. Therefore, the answer is likely B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
