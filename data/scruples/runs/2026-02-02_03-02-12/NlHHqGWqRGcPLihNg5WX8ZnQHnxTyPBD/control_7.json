      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about their friend who often rides in their car without contributing to gas. The author ended the free rides when the friend put $10 in gas after the author forgot their purse. Now the friend is asking for the purse back, and the author told them to find another way.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend usually takes rides without paying for gas, which the author handles by filling up the tank themselves. Then, in one instance, the friend put $10 in gas because the author forgot their purse at home. The next day, the friend asked for the purse back, and the author said they should find their own way around now.\n\nThe question is whether the author is an asshole by ending the free rides. To determine this, I should consider the fairness of the situation. The friend has been using the author's car without contributing to fuel costs for a long time. The author might feel it's unfair that the friend isn't helping with the expenses. The friend's one-time $10 contribution might have been a gesture to help with the gas the author needed to get their purse back. However, the author is now cutting off the rides entirely, which could be seen as an overreaction if the friend is relying on that transportation regularly.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has the right to set boundaries. If the friend expects to ride in the author's car, they should contribute to the costs. The author might have put up with it for a long time, but it's reasonable to ask for some contribution. The friend's single act of putting in $10 might not be enough if the author is covering all the gas costs otherwise. The author could have asked the friend to consistently contribute, but instead, they ended it after one instance. That might be seen as abrupt, but it's also a way to enforce a boundary.\n\nAnother angle is that the friend might be in a situation where they don't have reliable transportation, so the author's decision could impact them negatively. However, the author's right to their own car and the costs associated with it is also valid. The friend's use of the car without contributing to expenses could be seen as taking advantage. The author is within their rights to end the arrangement if they feel it's unfair.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the friend had a history of not contributing and the author finally set a boundary, even if it's a sudden one, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The friend might need to find another way, which is a consequence of their own actions. The key point is whether the author's action of ending the rides is a reasonable response to the friend not contributing to gas costs over time. If the author communicated their expectations and the friend didn't meet them, then it's justified. However, if the author didn't communicate this before, it might be abrupt. In the scenario described, the author didn't mention prior communication, just ending it after the one $10 contribution. That could be seen as unfair if the friend was expecting to continue as before. But if the author felt it was time to set a boundary, then they might not be in the wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the free rides because they have the right to set boundaries regarding their car and expenses. The friend's lack of consistent contribution justifies the author's decision, even if it was abrupt. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
