      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The friend has been using their car for rides many times without contributing to gas, but this time the friend put $10 in gas after the author forgot their purse. The author then told the friend to find their own way around in the future. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to confirm.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been getting free rides consistently, which the author has covered for gas. The friend's action of putting $10 in gas once might be seen as a kind gesture, but it's only a one-time contribution. The author is ending the rides because of this. \n\nFriendship dynamics matter here. Friends often help each other, but when it becomes a one-sided arrangement, it can lead to resentment. The author might feel taken advantage of, especially after hundreds of free rides. The friend not contributing to gas could be seen as unfair, especially if the author is covering all costs. \n\nThe key point is whether the friend's single act of putting $10 in gas justifies the author ending the rides. Since the friend had never contributed before, the author might feel that this is a small gesture and not a commitment. The author could be setting boundaries to prevent future exploitation. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might feel that they were trying to be considerate by adding gas once, but the author's reaction is overly harsh. However, the author has the right to set boundaries around their personal property and time. \n\nSo, considering the repeated use without contribution versus a one-time gesture, the author is likely justified in ending the rides. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
