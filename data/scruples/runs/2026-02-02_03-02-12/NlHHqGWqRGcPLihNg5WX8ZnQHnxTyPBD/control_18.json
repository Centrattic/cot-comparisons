      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend always rides with them, uses their car, and this time put $10 into gas when the author forgot their purse. The author then told the friend to find their own way in the future.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation objectively. The friend has been using the car without contributing to gas for hundreds of times. This time, they did put in $10, which the author might see as a small gesture but not a consistent contribution. The author is ending the rides, possibly because they feel it's unfair that the friend isn't contributing consistently.\n\nThe key points here are: recurring rides without payment, occasional payment, and the author's decision to stop. The question is whether the author is being unreasonable. Usually, when someone regularly uses another person's resources (like a car) without contributing, it's considered a one-sided arrangement. The friend's single act of putting $10 in might not make up for the hundreds of times they didn't. \n\nThe author is setting a boundary by saying the friend should find their own way. That seems reasonable because it's about fairness. People have different expectations, but if the author is consistently covering all the costs, it's understandable to want to stop. The friend's action this time might have been a reaction to the author's forgetfulness, but that doesn't justify the prior non-payment.\n\nIn terms of AITA standards, the author isn't being unfair. They're taking steps to protect their own resources. The friend might need to adjust their behavior, but the author isn't the asshole here. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
