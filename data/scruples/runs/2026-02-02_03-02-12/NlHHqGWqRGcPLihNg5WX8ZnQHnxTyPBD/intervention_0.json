      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author's friend usually gets rides everywhere in their car. The author fills up the gas, picks the friend up, and drops him off. This has happened hundreds of times without the friend contributing to gas. But this time, the friend put $10 in gas because the author forgot their purse at home. The author then told the friend to find their own way around in the future.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know if that's the case. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The friend has been taking rides without contributing to gas costs. That's not unusual in friendships, but it's a bit one-sided over time. The author is covering all the expenses. Now, when the friend finally does contribute $10, the author ends the arrangement. \n\nIs it fair for the author to stop giving rides after the friend contributed once? Well, the author might feel that the friend only did that because they had to, and it's a one-time gesture. The author might not see it as a reciprocal arrangement. Alternatively, the friend might feel they were trying to be considerate by contributing that $10, but the author's reaction is seen as harsh. \n\nBut the key points are that the author is the one who has been consistently providing the service (rides) without compensation, and the friend has only contributed once. The author is now ending the arrangement, possibly because the friend's contribution was insufficient or not consistent. \n\nIn many cases, people might expect that if someone is using your resources (like your car) frequently, they should share the cost. However, if the friend never contributed before and only did so once, the author might feel that the friend isn't taking responsibility for their part. \n\nThe author's decision to stop could be seen as standing up for their own needs and setting boundaries. The friend's action of putting $10 in gas might not be seen as enough by the author, especially since the friend had used the car hundreds of times without contributing. \n\nSo, from a fairness standpoint, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a right to set boundaries on their own time and resources. The friend's one-time contribution doesn't outweigh the hundreds of times they didn't contribute. Therefore, the author isn't being an asshole for ending the arrangement. \n\nI think the correct answer here is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
