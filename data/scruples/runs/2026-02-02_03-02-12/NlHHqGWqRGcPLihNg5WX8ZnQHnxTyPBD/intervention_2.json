      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending free rides. The situation is that the friend frequently uses the author's car without contributing to gas, except once when the author forgot their purse and the friend put $10 in gas. Now the author is telling the friend to find another way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has ridden in the car hundreds of times without paying for gas. That's a lot of times. The author provides transportation regularly, and the friend only contributed once. That seems like a one-time exception. So the author is setting a boundary here, which is understandable. People might feel that it's unfair to have to cover all the costs while the friend benefits.\n\nThen, the friend's action of putting $10 in gas might be seen as a nice gesture, but it's not consistent. The author might be tired of the imbalance. It's about mutual respect and fairness. The author is within their rights to decide when and how they want to use their car, and they're not obligated to provide free rides indefinitely. \n\nBut some might argue that the friend's single act of putting gas in could be seen as a sign of appreciation, and the author ending the rides might seem harsh. However, the main issue here is the consistent lack of contribution from the friend. The author is just asserting their own needs, which is a common scenario in relationships where boundaries are necessary.\n\nSo, based on this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're setting a boundary after repeated use without contribution. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
