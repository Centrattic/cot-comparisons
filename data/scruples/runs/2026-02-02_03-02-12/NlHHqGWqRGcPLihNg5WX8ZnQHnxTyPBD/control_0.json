The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for ending the free rides.\n\nThe situation is that their friend has been riding in their car a lot, and the friend only put gas in once when the author forgot their purse. The author is asking if they're an asshole for telling the friend to find another way.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has used the car hundreds of times without contributing to gas. The one time they did put in gas was when the author forgot their purse. So the friend's action was maybe out of obligation or a specific instance, not a regular contribution.\n\nThe author is ending the rides, which could be seen as a boundary. People often help friends, but if it's becoming a one-sided situation where the friend isn't contributing, it's reasonable to set limits. The friend might not be aware of the burden, or maybe they expect it as part of the friendship. But the author has a right to decide how their resources (like gas and car) are used.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friend didn't realize the impact. But the author is the one who has to maintain the car and pay for gas. It's their responsibility, so they can choose to stop offering rides. The friend using the car hundreds of times without contributing could be seen as taking advantage, so the author isn't wrong for ending it. The answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
