      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend regularly uses the author's car for rides, and even though the author fills up the gas tank, the friend only put $10 in gas once when the author forgot their purse. Now the author is telling the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations here. The friend has been taking rides hundreds of times without contributing to gas costs, and only once put $10 when the author forgot something. The author is now ending the rides, so the question is whether this is justified.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the friend never contributed before and only did so once, it's reasonable for the author to expect some contribution. The author is covering all costs (gas, maintenance, time) and the friend isn't sharing the burden. The author's request for the friend to find their own way seems like a boundary being set after repeated one-sided use.\n\nHowever, maybe the friend thought it was understood that they would help with gas sometimes. But the fact is, the friend didn't do it except once. The author is not obligated to provide free rides indefinitely. It's their car and their money, so they have the right to decide who uses it and under what terms. The friend might be taken aback, but the author is within their rights to change the arrangement.\n\nSo, based on this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their right to set boundaries. The answer should be B.\n"
