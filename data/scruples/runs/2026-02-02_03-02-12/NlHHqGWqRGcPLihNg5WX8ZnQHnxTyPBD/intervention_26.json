      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend has always ridden with them, the author fills up the gas, picks them up, etc. This time, the author forgot their purse, so the friend put $10 in gas. The author then told the friend to find another way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend has used the author's car hundreds of times without contributing to gas. The author is now asking them to handle their own transportation. The question is whether the author is being an asshole by ending this arrangement.\n\nI think the key points are: 1) The friend has been getting free rides, 2) The author is now setting a boundary after the friend contributed once, 3) The author is not being rude, just stating they need to find another way.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person acted unreasonably. The author isn't asking for reimbursement for past rides, just ending the free ride. The friend did contribute once, but the author is now saying no more. It seems the author is within their rights to set this boundary, especially since they've been covering the costs all along. The friend's one-time contribution might not be enough to justify continued free rides. The author is standing up for their own resources and time, which is reasonable. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
