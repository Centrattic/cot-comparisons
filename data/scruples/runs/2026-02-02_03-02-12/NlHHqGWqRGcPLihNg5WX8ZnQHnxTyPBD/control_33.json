      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend often rides in their car without contributing, but this time when the author forgot their purse, the friend put in $10 for gas. The author then told the friend to find their own way around in the future.\n\nSo, first, I need to figure out if the author's actions were justified. The friend usually doesn't pay for gas, which the author covers, but this time the friend did pay. However, the author decided to stop giving rides altogether. \n\nI think the key points here are about fairness and expectations. The friend has a history of not contributing, so maybe the author felt used. The friend only contributed once when reminded, but that's not enough to change the pattern. The author might be standing up for themselves, which is reasonable. On the other hand, maybe the author overreacted by cutting off rides completely instead of just asking for gas money each time.\n\nBut considering that the friend has ridden hundreds of times without paying, and only once after being reminded, it's understandable that the author is frustrated. The author's main issue is that the friend isn't contributing to the cost, even if it's their own gas. The author isn't obligated to provide rides for free, so telling the friend to find their own way isn't necessarily wrong. It's about setting boundaries. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
