      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're an asshole for ending free rides for their friend. The friend usually gets rides in their car, and the author fills up the gas. This time, the friend put $10 in gas because the author forgot their purse. The author then told the friend to find their own way around in the future.\n\nHmm. The main issue here is about fairness and expectations. The friend has ridden in the car hundreds of times without contributing to gas. Now that the author is asking them to contribute once, they're ending the arrangement. The user is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend usually doesn't pay for gas. Maybe the author has been covering all the costs, and the friend is not contributing. When the author forgot their purse, the friend helped out by putting $10 in gas. Then the author says the friend should find their own way. Is that fair?\n\nWell, the author might feel entitled to have the friend contribute when they can, especially since they've been driving them around for so long. However, the friend might feel that putting $10 in gas once is just a one-time thing and doesn't make up for all the free rides. The author is ending the rides because the friend didn't pay before, but the friend did help this time. Maybe the author is setting boundaries, but maybe it's a bit unfair to cut off all rides because of a single instance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is tired of the friend not contributing and is using this as a reason to stop. If the author had a conversation earlier about contributing to gas, that would be different. But since the friend has never contributed before, the author might be upset that the friend is suddenly helping only when it's convenient for them.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author's action is a reasonable boundary. If the author is fed up with the friend not helping with gas costs and is using this as a catalyst to end the rides, it's a bit of a split decision. On one hand, the friend did help this time, but they haven't in the past. The author might be punishing the friend for past behavior rather than the current situation. So maybe the author is not in the wrong because they have a right to set boundaries, especially if they're covering all costs. But if the author is being inconsistent (since the friend only paid once, but the author is ending all rides), maybe they're being a bit harsh.\n\nBut in the end, the author is the one using their car, paying for gas, and putting in time to pick up and drop off. They have the right to decide who pays for what in the car. So if they decide that from now on, the friend has to pay for gas, and the friend is unwilling, ending the arrangement isn't necessarily wrong. The problem is that the friend hasn't been paying before, so the author is enforcing a new rule. The friend might not be okay with that, but the author isn't in the wrong for setting limits on their own resources.\n"
