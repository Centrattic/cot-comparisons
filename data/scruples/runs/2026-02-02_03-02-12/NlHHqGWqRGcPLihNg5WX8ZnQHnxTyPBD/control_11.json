      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend has been using their car a lot, and when the author forgot their purse, the friend put in $10 for gas. The author then told the friend to find their own way around now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The friend has been getting free rides hundreds of times. The author is providing a service (transportation) without compensation, which might be a point of contention. The friend contributed $10 once, which is a small amount compared to the cumulative cost of gas over many rides. The author might feel that the friend isn't contributing fairly.\n\nBut then, friends often help each other without expecting payment. Maybe the author didn't mind the rides before, but now they're setting a boundary. The friend putting in $10 was a gesture, but the author is ending the arrangement altogether. The question is whether the author is justified in doing so.\n\nThe key points are: the author is ending the rides without a clear reason beyond the one-time payment. The friend's contribution was minimal compared to the overall cost. The author might be overreacting or using that as an excuse to stop the rides. Alternatively, the author has the right to set boundaries about their car and gas expenses. \n\nIn similar situations, people often expect some mutual effort or compensation if they're relying on someone's resources. The author might have been okay with the arrangement before, but the friend's one-time payment could be a catalyst for changing the situation. However, ending it abruptly after the friend did put in some money might be seen as unfair. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't obligated to provide free rides. They can decide to stop whenever they want. The friend's one-time payment doesn't equate to covering the costs, so the author's decision to stop could be seen as reasonable. But if the author is ending it because of that small payment, maybe they are being a bit harsh. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's action is a fair response. Since the friend contributed once but continued to get free rides, the author might be within their rights to set a boundary. However, the way they framed it (\"find your way around\") might be abrupt. But overall, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they can choose how to use their car and gas. The friend's actions don't obligate the author to continue the rides. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
