      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend usually gets rides in the author's car, with the author filling up the gas and picking them up and dropping them off. This weekend, the friend put $10 in gas because the author forgot their purse at home and asked the friend to return it. The author is now saying the friend should find their own way around in the future. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The main issue is whether the author was unfair by ending the arrangement. The friend had been using the author's car for rides many times without contributing to gas, except this one time. The author's decision to stop might be based on the friend not contributing enough, even though there was a single instance where the friend did put in $10.\n\nIn typical AITA scenarios, fairness and reciprocity are key. The friend had a free ride, which could be seen as one-sided. The author is the one covering all the costs (gas, wear and tear) without contribution. The friend's one-time $10 gas might not be enough to balance the ongoing cost. The author is now setting a boundary, which is reasonable. The friend might be used to this arrangement, but the author has the right to change their mind. \n\nHowever, the author's response seems abrupt. Ending all rides after a single instance of the friend contributing might be seen as harsh. Maybe a better approach would be to discuss and set expectations. But the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for ending it, especially if they felt taken advantage of. The friend's past behavior of not contributing could justify the author's decision. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't the asshole here. The friend might be the one who relied too much without contributing, and the author is asserting their right to stop. Therefore, the answer is B (No)."
