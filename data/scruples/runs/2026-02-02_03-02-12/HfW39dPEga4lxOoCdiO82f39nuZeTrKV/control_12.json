My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about custody and vacation plans. The author and their ex have a 50/50 custody agreement, alternating weeks. The ex wants the kids to go to a family reunion at Disneyland during the author's week, so they can switch weeks, but the author refuses. Now the kids are upset, thinking the author is the bad guy for not letting them go.\n\nFirst, the custody agreement is court-ordered, I assume, so the author has the legal right to have the kids during their scheduled weeks. The ex is trying to take the kids during that time. The author didn't switch weeks even when asked, which the ex claims is important because the family reunion can't be rescheduled. The author's stance is that they have the right to their week and didn't want to give it up. \n\nBut maybe there's a nuance here. The key points are: the custody agreement's flexibility, the ex's request to switch, and how the author communicated their refusal. The author mentions they've never switched weeks before unless it's extremely important. The ex is saying this is extremely important because the family can't reschedule. The author's response was firm, even to the point of hanging up.\n\nThe kids are upset because their ex-parent is making them think the author is the villain. The author tried to explain but the kids aren't listening. The author is frustrated, feeling wronged because they believe they're upholding the custody agreement.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, legally, if the custody agreement is strict and doesn't allow for switches unless both agree, then the author isn't wrong. But maybe there's a consideration for the kids' well-being. The ex's family reunion is a significant event. However, the author's right to their scheduled time is protected. The ex shouldn't force the author to switch without agreement. The author isn't obligated to give up their time unless the court order allows it. \n\nHowever, the author's approach\u2014saying \"tough luck\" and hanging up\u2014might come off as harsh, which could affect the kids' perception. But the core issue is about respecting the custody agreement. The ex is trying to use the kids to pressure the author, which is not appropriate. The author isn't in the wrong for upholding their custody rights. The ex is the one trying to disrupt the agreement. So the answer is B (Not the Asshole).\n"
