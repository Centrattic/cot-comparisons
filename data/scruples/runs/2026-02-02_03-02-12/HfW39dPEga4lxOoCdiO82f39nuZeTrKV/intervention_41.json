My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for not allowing their kids to go on a vacation with their ex during their scheduled custody week.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parents have a 50/50 custody agreement, switching every other week. The author has been strict about not switching days unless it's extremely important. Now, the ex wants to take the kids to Disneyland during the author's week. The author refused, leading to the kids being upset and the ex not helping to explain the situation.\n\nThe author claims they followed the custody agreement and that the ex is trying to manipulate the kids into thinking the author is the bad guy. The key points here are the custody arrangement and the actions each parent took. The ex approached the author about switching weeks, but the author refused because it's their scheduled time. The ex then told the kids that the author\u4e0d\u8ba9 them go, which caused the kids to be upset.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the custody agreement is strict and there's no provision for switching unless both agree, the author isn't violating any terms by not switching. The ex's parents scheduled the reunion during the author's week, so maybe the ex should have planned ahead. The author didn't initiate the request to switch, so they might be within their rights to refuse.\n\nHowever, the emotional impact on the kids is significant. The kids are upset and feeling torn between their parents. The author is trying to explain their side, but the ex isn't helping. The ex might be using the kids as pawns, which is a negative aspect. The author's refusal could be seen as prioritizing their time over the kids' wishes, but given the agreement, they have a valid point.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author followed the custody agreement, and the ex is the one trying to change plans. The ex might be at fault for not planning or for manipulating the kids. The author's actions are within the legal framework of the custody arrangement, even if it causes emotional distress. However, the emotional aspect is tricky\u2014parents should ideally cooperate for the kids' well-being, but if the agreement is clear, the author isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong because they upheld the custody agreement. The ex is the one trying to switch without the author's consent. The kids are caught in the middle, but the author isn't violating any rules. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
