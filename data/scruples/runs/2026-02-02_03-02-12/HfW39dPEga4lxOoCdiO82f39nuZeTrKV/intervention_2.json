My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their kids go on vacation with the ex during their scheduled week. The author has a 50/50 custody agreement, and the ex wanted to switch weeks for a family trip to Disneyland during the author's time. The author refused, leading to the kids being upset and the ex painting the author as the bad guy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the custody agreement. The author mentions that they've had the 50/50 arrangement for 8 years, and they've agreed not to switch days unless it's extremely important. The author has never given up their time before, even when asked. So, legally, the author might have a right to their scheduled time. But maybe there's more to it. \n\nThe kids are 16 and 9. The 16-year-old is old enough to feel betrayed, while the 9-year-old is upset too. The ex is using the kids's emotions to his advantage by making them think the author is blocking the trip. The author is trying to explain that it's their week, but the kids aren't listening. \n\nThe ex's parents hosted the reunion, and it's during the author's week. The author is standing by the custody agreement, which they both agreed to. The ex is asking for a switch, but the author isn't budging. The key point here is whether the ex's request was valid under their agreement. Since they agreed not to switch unless extremely important, and the author hasn't given up their time before, the author is technically following the agreement. \n\nHowever, maybe the ex's situation is a valid exception. But the author hasn't been flexible before, so maybe the ex is trying to get a switch now, which the author isn't willing to do. The author is standing by their right, but it's causing family tension. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, legally, if the custody agreement allows for no switching except in extreme cases, then the author isn't in the wrong. Emotionally, the kids are suffering, but that's because the ex is using them as pawns. The author's refusal is based on sticking to the agreement, which they both agreed to. \n\nThe ex is painting the author as the villain, which is manipulative. The author is trying to maintain their scheduled time, which is their right. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
