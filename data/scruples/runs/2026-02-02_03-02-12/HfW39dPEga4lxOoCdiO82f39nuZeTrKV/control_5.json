My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for refusing to let their ex partner take the kids during their scheduled custody week to go to a family reunion at Disneyland.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the custody agreement, which is 50/50 with strict rules about not switching weeks unless it's extremely important. The author has never switched before, even when asked, and this time the ex wants to do so for a family event. The author refused because it's their week. The kids are upset because the ex is framing the author as the bad guy, making the kids feel like they can't go. The author is frustrated and wants to know if they're the asshole for standing by their custody rights.\n\nNow, considering custody agreements, they are legally binding and both parents are supposed to adhere to them. The ex is trying to alter the schedule for a vacation during the author's time. The author's refusal isn't about revenge but about upholding the custody agreement. The ex's actions might be undermining the agreement by taking the kids without the agreed-upon switch.\n\nHowever, there's a possible issue with the kids' perception. The author's son is older and might understand the situation better, but the daughter is younger and upset. The author tried to explain but the kids don't accept it, possibly because the ex painted the author as being unreasonable. \n\nThe author isn't wrong for following the custody agreement. It's important to maintain the structure for the kids' well-being, especially if the agreement was made to ensure both parents have quality time. The ex is potentially violating the agreement by trying to take the kids without a switch. The author isn't the one breaking the rules; they're upholding their right. \n\nAdditionally, the author's communication with the ex seems to be strained, but that doesn't mean they're at fault here. The ex's refusal to apologize and his snarky attitude might be contributing to the kids' confusion, but the author's stance is justified in terms of custody rights. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for sticking to their custody schedule. The ex is the one attempting to disrupt it without proper negotiation. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
