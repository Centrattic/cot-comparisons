My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their kids go on vacation with their ex during their own custody week. \n\nFirst, the situation: The parents are divorced, have a 50/50 custody arrangement, and have agreed not to switch weeks unless it's extremely important. The ex wants to take the kids to Disneyland during the author's week, but the author refuses. The kids are upset, thinking the author is blocking them from going, and the ex isn't helping by not correcting them.\n\nSo, the key points here. The custody agreement was set up to alternate weeks, and both parties have followed it strictly for 8 years. The ex is asking to switch a week for a family reunion, but the author says no. The author believes that it's their time with the kids, and the ex is trying to make the kids think the author is being unreasonable. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the custody agreement is in place and both have been following it without issues, then the author is within their rights to not switch. The ex's parents scheduled the trip during the author's week, so the ex is the one who's trying to disrupt the schedule. The author isn't violating any terms here. \n\nEmotionally, the kids are upset because they want to go to Disneyland. But the author isn't the one preventing the trip; the ex is. The author is trying to maintain their custody time as agreed. However, the author's refusal to switch might not consider the kids' wishes, especially the older son's. But given the arrangement, the author isn't obligated to give up their time unless both agree. \n\nThe ex's actions seem manipulative, trying to paint the author as the bad guy. The author's response of refusing to switch is justified based on the custody agreement. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The problem lies with the ex not respecting the agreement and trying to shift blame. The answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
