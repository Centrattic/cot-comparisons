My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their kids go on a vacation with their ex during their own custody week. The author has a 50/50 custody agreement and refused to switch weeks even though the ex wanted to take the kids to Disneyland. The kids are upset, and the ex isn't helping by making the kids think the author is being unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the key points. The custody agreement was established as every other week, and they agreed not to plan things on each other's days unless it's extremely important. The author hasn't switched any weeks in 8 years, and the ex is now trying to get them to switch for a family reunion. The author refused, leading to the kids being upset and the ex not cooperating. The author feels it's their right to have the kids during their scheduled week.\n\nThe main question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants my opinion. I should consider legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if the custody agreement is set as 50/50 and there's no flexibility unless both agree, the author isn't violating anything by sticking to their schedule. The ex's request to switch would require mutual agreement, and since the author refused, there's no legal wrongdoing. Ethically, the author might be prioritizing their own time with the kids, but the kids are old enough to understand. However, the author's refusal might seem harsh because the kids want to go to Disneyland. But the author's stance is based on the agreement they both had, and the ex's parents can't reschedule. The ex is framing the author as the bad guy, which complicates things. The author did explain their reasoning, but the kids aren't accepting it.\n\nPossible angles: Is the author being unreasonable by not considering the children's wishes? But the custody agreement is a legal document they both agreed to. The ex's fault might be trying to switch without consensus. The author's right to their scheduled time isn't in question, but the children's emotional response is valid. However, the author isn't violating any rules. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
