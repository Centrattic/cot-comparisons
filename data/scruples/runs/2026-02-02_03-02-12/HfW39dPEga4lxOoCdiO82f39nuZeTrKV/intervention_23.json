My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about custody and a vacation plan. The author has a 50/50 custody agreement with their ex, and the ex wants to take the kids to a family reunion at Disneyland during the author's week. The author refused to switch weeks, leading to the kids being upset and the ex not helping clarify the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The custody agreement clearly states that they don't plan things on days that aren't theirs and don't switch weeks unless necessary. The author has followed this agreement strictly for 8 years, never giving up their time. Legally, the author's time with the kids is their right, so the ex can't just take it without a valid reason. The ex is asking to switch a week without a valid reason, which the author isn't obligated to allow. So legally, the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nLooking at the kids' reaction, the ex told them the author is the one preventing them from going to Disneyland, making the author the villain. But the author's reasoning is that it's their time. The kids might not understand the custody agreement, especially the younger daughter who is crying. The son, 16, might be more aware but is still upset, maybe feeling the author is being unfair. However, the ex is manipulating the situation by not explaining the reality to the kids, which is problematic.\n\nThe author tried to demand an apology from the ex, but the ex refuses, adding to the conflict. The ex's behavior is exacerbating the situation. The author's refusal to switch weeks was based on the existing agreement, so they're standing by their rights. The kids are being caught in the middle, which is tough, but the author isn't violating any terms of their custody agreement.\n\nIn terms of morality, the author is prioritizing their own time with the kids, which they have a right to. The ex is trying to bend the rules by scheduling a vacation during the author's time without a valid reason. The author isn't wrong in asserting their right to their scheduled time. The ex's actions are more in the wrong here for not respecting the agreement and manipulating the kids.\n\nSo, considering both legal and moral aspects, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
