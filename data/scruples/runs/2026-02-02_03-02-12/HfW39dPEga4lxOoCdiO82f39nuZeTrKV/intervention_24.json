My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a custody disagreement between the parent and their ex regarding a vacation to Disneyland during a scheduled visitation week.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the custody arrangement. They have a 50/50 split, switching every other week, and it's been that way for 8 years. The key point here is that they agreed not to plan things on days that aren't theirs unless it's extremely important and they don't switch weeks unless necessary. The parent (author) has never given up their time before, even when the ex begged. Now, the ex wants to take the kids to a family reunion at Disneyland during the author's week. The ex is asking to switch weeks, but the author refuses, leading to the kids being upset and the ex painting the author as the bad guy.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for not giving up their scheduled time. The author argues that the ex scheduled the trip during their time, so it's not their fault. The ex is trying to make the kids think the author is blocking them, which is causing emotional distress.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, custody agreements are typically enforceable. If the agreement states 50/50 with no switching unless agreed, the author isn't violating the agreement by holding their ground. The ex's parents scheduled the event during the author's time, so the onus is on them to adjust their plans if needed. The author is exercising their legal right to have the kids during their designated week.\n\nHowever, from an emotional perspective, the kids are upset. The author's son is not talking, and the daughter is crying. The ex is using the situation to make the kids view the author as the bad guy, which could be emotionally damaging. The author tried to explain but the kids are not listening. The author's stance is firm, but the impact on the children is significant.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for prioritizing their own time over the kids' wishes? It's a tough call. Legally, they're probably not in the wrong. But emotionally, maybe they are. But the ex is also manipulating the situation to make the author look bad. The author's refusal to switch is within the agreed terms, and the ex's insistence without flexibility might be the real issue here.\n\nThe author's response (\"tough luck\") when the ex asked to switch weeks is firm but perhaps not the most compassionate. However, given the history of the divorce and the existing custody agreement, the author is standing by their rights. The ex's actions in not respecting the agreement and trying to alienate the kids might be the real problem.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at both legal/contractual obligations and the impact on others. Since the author is adhering to the agreed terms, they might not be in the wrong. The ex's actions in scheduling during the author's time and then trying to blame the author could be the root of the issue. The kids are caught in the middle, but the author is within their rights.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They are upholding their custody agreement, and the ex is the one trying to disrupt it without valid reason beyond their own plans.\n"
