My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not allowing their kids to go on vacation with their ex during the author's designated custody week. The situation is a 50/50 custody agreement where they switch every other week. The ex wants to take the kids to Disneyland during the author's week, and the author refused. Now the kids are upset and the ex is acting like the author is being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the custody agreement clearly states that each parent has specific weeks and they don't switch unless agreed, then the author is probably within their rights by not changing the schedule. The ex's parents scheduled the reunion during the author's time, so maybe it's their fault for not coordinating properly. \n\nBut then there's the emotional impact on the kids. The son is not talking, and the daughter is crying. The author explains the situation, but the kids think the author is being mean. The author's stance is about upholding their time, but the ex is making the kids feel like the author is withholding their vacation. The author's response of \"tough luck\" might come off as too harsh. Maybe there's a middle ground, like the ex parents finding another time or the author considering a flexible arrangement if possible. However, the author mentions that they've never switched before unless extremely important, and the ex hasn't done that. \n\nAlso, the ex's communication seems manipulative, trying to frame the author as the bad guy. The author tried to address it by talking to the kids but wasn't successful. The key points are the existing agreement, the ex's lack of prior flexibility, and the impact on the children. \n\nLegally, the author isn't in the wrong because the agreement is in place. Emotionally, it's a tough spot. The kids are caught in the middle, but the author's refusal is based on the agreement. The ex might be the one at fault for scheduling during the author's time without considering the rules they both set. The author's firmness could be justified if the agreement is non-negotiable, but the way they handled it (hanging up, saying \"tough luck\") might be seen as uncooperative. However, the ex isn't offering a valid reason to switch, just expecting it because of their parents. \n\nIn the end, the author isn't violating the custody agreement, so they're not in the wrong. The ex is pushing boundaries that they've previously agreed not to. The kids' reactions are because of the conflict, but the author's position is about their right to the time. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
