My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their kids go on vacation with the ex because it's their custody week. \n\nFirst, the background: they have a 50/50 custody arrangement, and they've agreed not to switch days unless it's extremely important. The ex wanted to take the kids to Disneyland during the author's week. The author refused, leading to the kids being upset and the ex not apologizing.\n\nSo, the main points are the custody agreement and the ex's actions. The author followed the agreement by not switching weeks, which they had always done before. The ex tried to schedule something during the author's time, which the author considered their right. The ex then blamed the author, making the kids think they aren't allowed to go, causing emotional distress.\n\nNow, considering custody rights, if the agreement is clear and both parties agreed not to switch unless necessary, the author isn't in the wrong for sticking to that. The ex's parents scheduled it during the author's week, which might not be their fault. However, the ex should have considered the custody schedule when planning. The author's refusal to switch is within their rights, but the way they handled it (hanging up, being firm) might have upset the kids, who are caught in the middle.\n\nBut the key here is the custody agreement. The author isn't violating it. The ex is the one trying to use the kids' time during the author's week. The author's actions are protecting their own custody rights. However, the kids are upset because they want to go on vacation. The author didn't communicate properly with the kids, leading them to believe the author is blocking the trip, which might be why they're upset. But the author tried to explain, and the kids aren't listening because the ex framed it that way.\n\nSo, legally and by their own agreement, the author isn't wrong. Emotionally, the kids are suffering, but that's due to the ex's manipulation and the situation's complexity. The author's stance is justified, but maybe they could have handled the communication better. But the question is about being in the wrong. Since the author adhered to the custody agreement and the ex didn't respect it, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
