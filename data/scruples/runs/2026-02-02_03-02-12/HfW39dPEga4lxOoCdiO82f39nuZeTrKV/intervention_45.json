My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about custody time and a vacation. The author and their ex have a 50/50 custody agreement, and they've been sticking to it for 8 years without switching weeks. The ex wants to take the kids to Disneyland during the author's week, but the author refuses because it's their scheduled time. The kids are upset, thinking the author is blocking them from going.\n\nFirst, the custody agreement was set up by both parties, and they agreed not to plan things on each other's weeks unless it's extremely important. The ex is asking to switch a week, but the author says no. The author's main point is that they're upholding the agreement they both made. The ex is trying to represent the author as the villain, which is causing the kids to be upset. \n\nThe author is standing by their right to have their scheduled time. But maybe the problem is that they didn't consider the kids' desires here. The kids are 16 and 9, so their interests might be important. The ex's parents are hosting a family reunion, which might be a significant event. However, the custody agreement is in place, and the ex initiated the request. The author's refusal isn't out of spite but to maintain the agreement. \n\nBut could the author have been more flexible? Maybe they could have tried to find a compromise, like letting the ex take the kids for part of the week while the author keeps the other part. However, the ex was asking to switch the entire week, and the author might not want to give up their time. Also, the ex's approach of telling the kids that the author is blocking them is manipulative. \n\nThe author's actions are within the legal and agreed-upon terms. The ex is violating the agreement by pushing for a switch without the author's consent. The kids are being affected emotionally, but the author isn't at fault for enforcing the custody schedule. The ex's manipulation is the real issue here. So, the author isn't in the wrong; they're upholding their agreement. The answer should be B.\n"
