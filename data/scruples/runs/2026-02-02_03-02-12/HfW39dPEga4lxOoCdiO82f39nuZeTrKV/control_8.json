My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for not letting their kids go on vacation with their ex during their scheduled time. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The parents have a 50/50 custody agreement, which they've followed for 8 years without switching days unless necessary. The ex wants to take the kids to Disneyland during the author's time, which is scheduled during the author's week. The author refused, leading to the kids being upset and the ex not apologizing. \n\nThe key points here are the custody agreement terms. Both parents agreed not to plan things on days that aren't theirs unless it's extremely important. The ex approached the author to switch weeks, but the author declined. The author's stance is that the ex scheduled the vacation during their time, which the author believes is unfair. \n\nNow, considering custody agreements, they are typically legally binding and both parties are expected to adhere to them. If the agreement states that they don't switch weeks unless there's an extreme circumstance, the author is within their rights to enforce that. The ex's request to switch might be seen as a breach of the agreed terms unless there's a valid, extenuating reason. However, the ex's parents' reunion is presented as a special event, but the author might argue that it's not an emergency. \n\nThe kids are upset because they were told the author is being difficult. The author feels it's their right to have the kids during their scheduled time, and the ex isn't respecting the agreement. The author's refusal isn't just about the vacation but about upholding the custody terms. \n\nPossible angles to consider: Was there a valid reason for the ex to request a switch? The author mentions that the ex's parents can't reschedule, but the author isn't obligated to switch unless there's an agreement. The ex's approach might be seen as trying to manipulate the kids' feelings against the author, which is problematic. \n\nIn terms of legal perspective, unless there's a provision for special circumstances, the author isn't in the wrong. Emotionally, the kids are caught in the middle, which is unfortunate, but the author isn't violating the custody agreement. The ex might be at fault for not adhering to the agreed terms and using the kids as pawns. \n\nSo, the answer seems to lean towards the author not being in the wrong. They upheld their custody rights as per the agreement. The ex's actions and refusal to apologize are contributing to the conflict, not the author's refusal to switch weeks.\n"
