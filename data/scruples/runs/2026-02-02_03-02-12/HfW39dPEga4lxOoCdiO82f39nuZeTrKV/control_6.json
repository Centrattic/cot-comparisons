My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe user is a parent who has a 50/50 custody agreement with their ex-spouse. They mention they don't get along and rarely talk outside of the kids. The key point here is the custody arrangement's terms: they don't plan things on days that aren't theirs and rarely switch weeks unless it's extremely important. The user has never given up their time before, even when asked.\n\nNow, the ex wants to take the kids to Disneyland during the user's week. The ex asked to switch weeks or for the user to let the kids stay with him, but the user refused. The ex is portraying the user as the bad guy, making the kids upset. The kids are now angry, with the son not talking and the daughter crying.\n\nThe user is defending their position by saying it's their appointed time and that the ex scheduled something during their week. They feel it's unfair and that they're just upholding the custody agreement. They asked the ex for an apology, but the ex refused.\n\nSo, from a legal standpoint, if the custody agreement clearly states that they can't switch weeks unless it's an emergency or extremely important, the user is following the agreement. The ex tried to request a switch, but the user is within their rights to deny it if it's not an emergency. The ex's parents scheduled the event during the user's week, which complicates things. However, the agreement's terms would prioritize the user's scheduled time unless there's a valid reason to switch.\n\nThe kids are upset because they want to go on the vacation, but the user is standing by their agreement. The user feels they're not the one being unfair; the ex is trying to make them the villain. The ex's refusal to provide an apology and the way he's framing the situation might indicate that he's overstepping by trying to manipulate the kids.\n\nIn terms of parental rights, the user has the right to spend their allocated time with the children. Unless there's a legal obligation to allow such a switch, the user isn't in the wrong. The ex might be the one at fault for not respecting the agreement unless he can prove the switch is necessary. However, the ex's parents scheduling during the user's time might be a factor, but unless there's a legal provision for such events, the user's stance is justified.\n\nThe emotional impact on the kids is significant, but that's more about how the ex is handling the situation rather than the user's actions. The user is adhering to the custody agreement, so legally and based on the terms they've both agreed to, they aren't in the wrong. The ex's actions of portraying the user as the bad guy and not respecting the agreement could be the issue here.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
