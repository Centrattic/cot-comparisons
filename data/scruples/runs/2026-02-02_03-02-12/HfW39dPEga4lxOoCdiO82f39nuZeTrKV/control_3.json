My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their kids go on vacation with their ex during their scheduled visitation time. The parents have a 50/50 custody agreement, which they've been following for 8 years. The ex wants to take the kids to Disneyland during the author's week, but the author refuses to switch weeks. The kids are upset, the ex is painting the author as the bad guy, and the author feels wronged.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. A 50/50 custody agreement typically means both parents have equal rights to their children's time. If the agreement states that they can't switch weeks unless it's extremely important, then the author is within their rights to not give up their scheduled time. The ex's parents scheduled the reunion during the author's week, so maybe the ex should have planned better. However, family events can sometimes be unpredictable, but the agreement was clear. The author hasn't violated any terms by refusing to switch. \n\nNext, the emotional impact on the kids. The kids are upset because they want to go to Disneyland. The author is trying to explain that it's their scheduled time, but the ex is making them feel like the author is being mean. The author is frustrated because they believe they're standing by their agreement, but the kids are taking it personally. The son and daughter are reacting emotionally, which is common in teenagers and young children. The author might need to address the kids' feelings more directly, even if the decision is legally sound.\n\nThe ex's behavior is also a factor. The ex is using the kids to manipulate the situation and not being cooperative. The author is firm in their stance, which could be justified, but the way they communicated (\"tough luck\" and hanging up) might have contributed to the tension. Maybe a more diplomatic approach could have helped, but if the agreement is strict, the author isn't wrong to enforce it.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't taking away the kids without reason. They have the right to their time. The ex's request is during the author's scheduled week, and unless there's a valid reason to switch, the author isn't in the wrong. The problem might be the ex not respecting the agreement and trying to bend the rules for their benefit. The author's refusal could be seen as standing up for their rights as a parent, even if it causes short-term upset.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author isn't in the wrong. They followed the custody agreement, and the ex is the one trying to change the terms without valid cause. The answer should be B.\n"
