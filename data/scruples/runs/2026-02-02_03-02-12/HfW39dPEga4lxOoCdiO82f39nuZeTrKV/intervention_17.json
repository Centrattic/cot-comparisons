My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to process this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing their kids to go on vacation with their ex during the author's custody time. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author has a 50/50 custody arrangement, which they've followed strictly for eight years. They've never switched days unless it was extremely important. Now, the ex wants to take the kids to Disneyland during the author's week, asking to switch weeks. The author refuses because it's their time, and the kids are upset, thinking the author is the bad guy.\n\nSo, the key points here are the custody agreement and the ex's request. The author's stance is that the ex scheduled the trip during their time, so they're not giving up their rights. The ex is trying to make the kids believe the author is being unfair by not allowing the vacation. The author didn't make the ex's parents schedule it during their time, so they feel it's not their fault. \n\nI need to consider legal aspects. Since there's a court-ordered custody arrangement, the author is following it. The ex is asking to deviate from the schedule, but the author isn't obligated to agree unless both parties agree. The ex's refusal to communicate properly and the kids' reactions are part of the conflict. \n\nThe author isn't the one breaking the custody agreement. The ex is making a unilateral decision to plan something during the author's time, which the author has the right to refuse. The kids are upset because they were told the author is blocking the trip, but the author is just upholding their custody rights. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're following the agreed-upon schedule, and the ex is trying to manipulate the situation. The kids' anger is due to the ex's actions, not the author's. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
