My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves a custody arrangement where both parents have 50/50 time with their kids, switching every other week. The ex wants to take the kids to Disneyland during the author's week, so the author refuses. Now the kids are upset, thinking the author is preventing them from going, and the ex is framing the author as the bad guy.\n\nFirst, the custody agreement was established as part of their divorce, and both agreed not to plan things on days that aren't theirs. The author hasn't broken this agreement before, so this seems like a precedent they've both respected. The ex is now trying to switch weeks, but the author says no. The key here is that the custody schedule is a legal agreement, and unless there's a court order allowing for switches, the author has the right to their scheduled time.\n\nThe author is defending their right to spend time with their kids as per the agreement. The ex is trying to get the kids to see them as the villain, which could be a manipulation tactic. The kids are young and emotionally affected, which adds to the tension. The author isn't violating any terms of their custody agreement, so legally and by their mutual agreement, they're in the right. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the kids' desire to go to Disneyland is valid, especially since they're caught in the middle. But the parent's right to their custody schedule is also important. The ex's approach of getting the kids upset and not respecting the agreement could be seen as the real issue here. The author is standing by their right, which is within the bounds of their agreement. So, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
