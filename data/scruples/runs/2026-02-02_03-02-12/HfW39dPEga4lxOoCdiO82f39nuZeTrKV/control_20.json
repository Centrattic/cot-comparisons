My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a custody dispute where the parent (author) is refusing to give up their scheduled time with the kids to allow the ex to take them on a vacation to Disneyland.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The divorce happened 8 years ago with a 50/50 custody arrangement, alternating every other week. The key agreement was that they don't plan things on days that aren't theirs and rarely switch unless extremely important. The author has never before given up their time, even if the ex asked. Now, the ex is asking to switch a week because his parents are hosting a family reunion at Disneyland, which is during the author's week. The author refused, leading to the kids being upset and the ex painting the author as the bad guy.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong by not allowing the kids to go on the vacation during their scheduled time. To determine this, I need to consider several factors: the custody agreement's terms, the children's well-being, the fairness of the situation, and the parents' roles.\n\nThe custody agreement clearly states that they don't switch weeks unless it's extremely important. The author has consistently followed this rule, never giving up their time before. The ex is now asking for a switch for a vacation, which the author might not consider extremely important. The author's right to spend time with the kids is a key point here. Custody agreements are legally binding, and each parent has the right to their scheduled time unless there's a mutual agreement or a valid reason to change it.\n\nHowever, the ex is framing the author as the bad guy, which might be affecting the children's perception. The kids are upset, with the daughter crying and the son cutting off communication. The author is trying to explain the situation, but the ex's influence is causing tension. \n\nI should also consider if the author's refusal is justified. If the ex's parents scheduled the trip during the author's week without considering the custody agreement, that's on the ex. The author isn't obligated to give up their time unless they agree. The ex's claim that it's the only possible week for the family might not be valid unless proven. The author is standing by the terms they both agreed to, so they aren't necessarily at fault for enforcing those terms.\n\nOn the other hand, the children's feelings matter. The kids want to go to Disneyland, which is a significant event. However, the author's time with the kids is also important for their well-being. The ex's approach of making the kids believe the author is being unfair could be more harmful in the long run, affecting the children's relationship with both parents.\n\nIn terms of legal standing, unless there's a clause allowing for such exceptions, the author isn't in the wrong. The ex is asking for a switch without a valid reason as per their agreement. The author's refusal is a right they have under the custody arrangement. The ex's actions in manipulating the children against the author are problematic, but that doesn't make the author the one at fault here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They are upholding the agreed-upon custody terms, and the ex is the one trying to bend those rules without justification. The children's upset is a result of the ex's influence and the situation's circumstances, not the author's wrongdoing.\n"
