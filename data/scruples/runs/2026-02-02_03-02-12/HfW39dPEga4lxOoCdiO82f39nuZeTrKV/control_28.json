My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is a parent who's refusing to let their kids go on a vacation with their ex during the author's custody week. They have a 50/50 custody arrangement, and the ex wants to switch weeks for a Disneyland trip, but the author says no. The kids are upset, especially the son who's not talking and the daughter who's crying. The ex is also upset and is making the kids think the author is being mean.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the custody agreement. They have a 50/50 arrangement, and they agreed not to switch weeks unless it's extremely important. The author has never switched before, even when asked. The ex's request is for a family reunion, but the author's time is their own. So, legally, if the custody is set by court order, the author is within their rights to keep their scheduled time. The ex is trying to get a switch, but the author isn't obligated unless both agree.\n\nNext, the emotional impact. The kids are upset because they want to go on vacation with their other parent. The author is trying to enforce boundaries, but the kids might not understand the conflict between parents. The author's refusal might make the kids feel like they're losing out on family time with the ex, but the author's stance is about upholding the custody agreement. However, the author is also causing stress for the kids by not being flexible, especially if the ex's situation is a once-in-a-lifetime event. But the author has a point that the ex is using their time without considering the arrangement.\n\nThe ex's behavior might be manipulative, using the kids to get what they want. The author is correct in not wanting to switch weeks without mutual agreement. However, the kids are caught in the middle, and the author's rigid stance might be making them feel like they're being pitted against their other parent. The author's main argument is that it's their time, and the ex is asking for a switch during that time. The ex isn't respecting the custody agreement by making this request, but the author's refusal might be seen as not considering the kids' wishes.\n\nBut the author is also the parent responsible for the kids during that week. If they don't allow the switch, they are following the agreement. However, the kids are old enough (16 and 9) to understand some aspects, but the younger one is still young. The older son might be more aware of the conflict. The author's actions are legally correct, but emotionally, it's causing distress.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? They might not be legally, but maybe emotionally, they could be seen as not being flexible enough. However, the ex is violating the agreement by pushing for a switch. The author's refusal is justified under the custody terms. The ex's manipulation might be the real issue here, not the author's refusal. So the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because they're adhering to their custody agreement. The ex is the one trying to disrupt it without mutual agreement. The kids are caught in the middle, but the author isn't at fault for standing by their rights.\n"
