My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The author is a parent who is refusing to let their kids go on a vacation with the ex during their appointed custody week. The ex wants to take the kids to Disneyland during the author's week, and the author is standing by the custody agreement.\n\nFirst, the custody agreement is 50/50, switching every other week. The key point is that both parents agreed to not plan things on each other's days unless it's extremely important. The author has followed this agreement strictly for 8 years, never switching weeks unless asked. Now, the ex is trying to switch the week for a family reunion, but the author is refusing. \n\nThe ex is painting the author as the bad guy by telling the kids that they can't go to Disneyland because the parent is being selfish. The kids are upset, with the son not talking and the daughter crying. The author is trying to explain that it's their time, but the kids aren't listening because the ex has framed it that way.\n\nLegally, if the custody agreement states that they can't switch weeks unless it's an emergency, the author is within their rights to stick to the schedule. The ex's parents' event is scheduled during the author's week, and the ex is trying to take the kids during that time without the author's consent. The author is firm about their rights under the custody agreement. The ex's actions might be manipulative, using the kids against the author. \n\nThe author's refusal isn't about revenge but about upholding the agreement. The ex is not following the established rules, which the author has always respected. The kids' anger is because they don't understand the custody situation, and the ex is exploiting that. The author is trying to correct the narrative but faces resistance from both the ex and the kids. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They are adhering to the agreed-upon custody terms, and the ex is the one deviating without valid reason. The answer should be B (No).\n"
