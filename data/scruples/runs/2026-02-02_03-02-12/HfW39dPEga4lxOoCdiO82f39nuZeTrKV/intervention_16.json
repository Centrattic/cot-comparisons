My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing their kids to go on vacation with the ex during their scheduled time. The situation is a divorce with a 50/50 custody agreement. The key points are the custody schedule, the ex's attempt to switch weeks, and the kids' reactions.\n\nFirst, the custody agreement was agreed upon 8 years ago, and the author has consistently followed it, not switching days even when asked. That shows they've respected the agreement. The ex approached last week about switching for a family reunion at Disneyland. The author refused because it's their week, which seems reasonable as the agreement states not to plan things on non-own days unless extremely important. The ex's parents couldn't reschedule, so he tried to take the kids during the author's week. The author refused, leading to the kids being upset because the ex framed it as the author not letting them go.\n\nThe author's stance is about upholding the custody agreement. The ex is pushing to change the schedule without a valid reason, and the author is standing by the original agreement. The kids are caught in the middle, but the author isn't the one breaking the agreement. The ex is the one trying to switch, and the author is asserting their rights. The kids' anger is likely due to the ex's manipulation, not the author's actions.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're following the custody arrangement, and the ex is the one trying to bend the rules. The answer should be B.\n"
