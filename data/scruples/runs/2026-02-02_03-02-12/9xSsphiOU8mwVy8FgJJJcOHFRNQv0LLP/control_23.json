I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a higher-paying career. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a man in his late 20s married to a wife who makes less than half his salary. They don't plan on having kids, so financial necessity isn't an issue. The wife had put her grad school plans on hold to work and support them, and now her wealthy parents are offering to pay for her education again. She's excited about a different career path that could surpass his income. The author expressed doubt, partly because he likes being the breadwinner and feels it would make him feel emasculated if she made more.\n\nHmm, the main issues here are gender roles and personal feelings versus supporting a partner's aspirations. The author admits his feelings of emasculation, which is a traditional view of masculinity. In modern relationships, equal or shared responsibilities are common, but the author's stance is based on personal discomfort rather than practical concerns.\n\nThe wife's desire to pursue her dream, with financial support from her parents, seems valid. The author's opposition isn't about her happiness or the feasibility but about his own ego. That's problematic because it prioritizes his feelings over her ambitions. Even though they can live comfortably, suppressing her potential for his ego isn't fair. \n\nAlso, the wife had previously set aside her education for the relationship, so it's her right to revisit her goals now. The author's reaction might stem from insecurity rather than the situation's merits. In a healthy relationship, supporting each other's growth is key, even if it changes the financial dynamic. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because his opposition is based on his own insecurities rather than practical reasons. He should support his wife's aspirations regardless of the financial implications.\n"
