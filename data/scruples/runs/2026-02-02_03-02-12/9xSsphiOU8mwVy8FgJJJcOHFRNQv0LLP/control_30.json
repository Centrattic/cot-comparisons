I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the husband doesn't want his wife to go back to grad school because it might make her earn more than him. He feels that would make him feel emasculated. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the key points: They're in their late 20s, have no kids, he's the main breadwinner, and she's considering a higher-paying career. The husband's main issue is about his ego and feeling emasculated if she makes more. But the wife seems genuinely interested in pursuing her dream. \n\nThe husband's reasoning is based on his own insecurities rather than practical concerns. He mentions they don't need more money, so financial necessity isn't the issue. The fact that he's uncomfortable with being the lower earner points to a personal issue about his self-worth tied to financial status. That seems problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife has a right to pursue her own goals and career aspirations. Her parents are supporting her education, which might be a good opportunity. The husband's opposition could be seen as controlling or not supporting her autonomy. \n\nSociety is moving towards more equality in partnerships, and valuing personal fulfillment over traditional gender roles is important. The husband's concern about being emasculated is a personal feeling, but that doesn't justify opposing his wife's ambitions. \n\nHowever, maybe there are other factors, like the wife's interest in the new career versus her current job. The husband did mention she loves her current job, but she says she wants to pursue her dream. If she's sure about the change, it's her choice. \n\nSo, in terms of right and wrong, the husband is prioritizing his own ego over his wife's aspirations. That's a problem. He should support her decisions unless there are valid, mutual concerns. Since he's not voicing any practical issues (like financial strain, which isn't an issue here) but rather personal insecurities, he's in the wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A.\n"
