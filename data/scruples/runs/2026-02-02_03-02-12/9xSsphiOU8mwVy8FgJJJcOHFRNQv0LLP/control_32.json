I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The husband makes enough for both of them, and they don't plan to have kids. The wife previously put her grad school on hold to work full-time, and now her parents are offering to pay for her grad school. The husband is against her going back because he feels emasculated if she makes more than him. He's okay with her current job but doesn't want her to switch paths, even though she's excited about it.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's think about the dynamics here. The wife has her own aspirations and her parents are supporting her education. The husband's reasoning is based on his ego and financial status. That's a red flag because a healthy relationship should support each other's growth. The fact that he's worried about being the breadwinner and feeling emasculated suggests he might have issues with self-worth tied to finances.\n\nAlso, the wife is making a decision that's important for her, and his opposition is based on his own feelings rather than her happiness or her goals. Even though he acknowledges it's not a popular opinion, the main issue is whether it's right for him to discourage her career advancement because it affects his ego.\n\nIn relationships, both partners should have autonomy in their careers. The husband's stance could hinder his wife's personal and professional growth. Even though they don't need the money, she has the right to pursue her dreams. His feelings of emasculation are subjective, but the fact remains that his opposition is not in line with supporting her. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's prioritizing his own ego over his wife's aspirations and happiness. He should support her if she's decided to go back to school, regardless of the financial implications. The fact that they can afford to live comfortably means that her earning more isn't a financial burden but a personal achievement for her.\n"
