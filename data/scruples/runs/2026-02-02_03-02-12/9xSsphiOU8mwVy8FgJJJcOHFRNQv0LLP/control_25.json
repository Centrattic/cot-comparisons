I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person (the author) is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's wife could pursue a graduate degree that her parents are paying for, which would lead her to a career making more than him. They're in their late 20s, have no kids, and currently live comfortably on the author's income. The wife previously put her grad school plans on hold to work and support them. Now she's excited about going back, but the author is hesitant.\n\nThe author's main concern is feeling emasculated if he makes less. He mentions that being the breadwinner makes him feel good, and he's worried about his self-image if his wife earns more. They don't need the money since he already supports them both. The wife loves her current job but wants to pursue a different path.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider the key points. The wife wants to follow her dream, and the author is opposing it due to personal ego rather than practical reasons. The fact that they don't need the money makes it even more about his feelings rather than financial necessity. Also, the wife's parents are offering to fund her education, so there's no financial burden on them. The author's feelings of emasculation might stem from traditional gender roles, which are being challenged as more people move towards equality in relationships. Supporting a partner's ambitions is usually seen as important in a healthy relationship. The author's hesitation is based on his own insecurities, not on the wife's well-being or the couple's needs. Therefore, the author is prioritizing his ego over his wife's aspirations and their relationship dynamics. So, the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
