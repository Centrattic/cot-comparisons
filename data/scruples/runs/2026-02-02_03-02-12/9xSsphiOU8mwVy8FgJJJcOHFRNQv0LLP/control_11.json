I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The author of the question is a man who doesn't want his wife to pursue a career that would make her higher than him. He's worried about feeling emasculated even though they can live comfortably on his salary alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife had put her grad school plans on hold to work full-time, which supported their relationship. Now, her parents are offering to fund her education, and she wants to go back. The author is against it not because of financial necessity but because his ego is tied to being the breadwinner. \n\nThe main issue here is the husband's motivation. He's not concerned about the practical aspects of her career change, like job satisfaction or her long-term goals, but rather his own feelings about being emasculated. That seems to be the core of his opposition. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's important to note that a person's career choices should ideally be their own decision, especially if it's feasible financially. The husband's objection isn't based on financial need or other valid reasons but on his personal insecurities. This could be seen as undermining his wife's autonomy and her personal growth. \n\nHowever, there's another angle. The husband might feel that their current setup is working, and he might be worried about the disruption that a new career path would bring. But since they don't have kids and he's okay with her current job, the main issue is his own feelings about his role as the breadwinner. \n\nSociety is moving towards more equality in relationships, and traditional gender roles are being challenged. In a modern context, it's expected that both partners can pursue their own careers regardless of income. The husband's stance might be seen as outdated or selfish, prioritizing his ego over his wife's aspirations.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. The fact that he's being honest about his feelings is important. However, acting on those feelings by discouraging his wife from pursuing her goals could indeed be in the wrong. Supportive relationships should encourage each other's growth, even if it changes the dynamic.\n\nAlso, considering the wife's past decision to put her education on hold, this might be her chance to fulfill her own dreams. The husband's support is crucial here. His opposition, even if based on personal feelings, could be seen as a barrier to her personal fulfillment.\n\nSo, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because his reasoning is based on his own insecurities rather than objective practical concerns. A healthy relationship should support each other's ambitions regardless of income levels.\n"
