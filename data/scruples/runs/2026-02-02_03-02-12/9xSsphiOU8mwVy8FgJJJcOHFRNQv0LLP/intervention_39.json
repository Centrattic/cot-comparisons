I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the husband) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The husband makes enough to support them both comfortably. His wife currently earns less than half of his salary. She put her grad school plans on hold when he was getting his master's, and she found a job she loves. Now, her wealthy parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which could lead to a higher salary than him. The husband is conflicted because he feels emasculated at the thought of her earning more than him, even though they don't need the money.\n\nThe key points here are the husband's motivations. He's not against her getting a better education or career for her own advancement; the main issue is his personal feelings about being the primary breadwinner. The wife is following her dream and has the financial support from her parents. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, a spouse shouldn't hold back their partner's career just to maintain their own ego. It's about supporting each other's growth. The husband's reasoning is based on his self-esteem, which isn't a valid reason to prevent her from pursuing her goals. Also, financially, they don't need the extra income, so it's not about necessity. \n\nHowever, the husband isn't forcing her; he's expressing his concerns. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting her to take the opportunity. If he's actively discouraging her for selfish reasons, that's problematic. Even if he's not stopping her from doing it, his disapproval could affect her decision-making. \n\nIn relationships, supporting each other's aspirations is important. The husband's feelings about being the breadwinner shouldn't override his wife's career choices, especially when she's happy with her current job but still wants to pursue her dream. The fact that her parents are willing to cover the costs removes the financial burden, making her decision more about her personal fulfillment. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be AITA (Am I the Asshole) if the husband is in the wrong. The main issue is his ego conflicting with his wife's career aspirations. Even though the situation isn't straightforward, the husband's primary reason is his own insecurities rather than practical concerns. Therefore, he is in the wrong because he's prioritizing his self-esteem over his wife's happiness and growth.\n"
