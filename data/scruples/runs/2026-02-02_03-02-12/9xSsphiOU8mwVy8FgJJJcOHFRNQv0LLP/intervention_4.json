I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author and his wife are in their late 20s, financially stable with him being the higher earner. She's currently working but earns less. They don't plan to have kids, so there's no immediate need for her to increase her income. She previously put her grad school plans on hold to work full-time, which he supported. Now her wealthy parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead to a higher salary than his current one. He's against it because he feels emasculated if he's not the primary earner, even though they're doing fine financially.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong, but they want a second opinion. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nI need to consider several factors here. First, the dynamics of their relationship. The wife is making a personal decision about her future. The author's reason for opposing it is based on his feelings about being the breadwinner, which is more about ego than practical necessity. They don't need the money, so it's a matter of personal satisfaction for him. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, supporting each other's ambitions is key. The author is prioritizing his own feelings over his wife's aspirations. Even though their financial situation is secure, the wife's desire to pursue her dream and potentially a higher salary should be respected. The fact that her parents are funding the education removes financial strain from her decision. \n\nThe husband's concern about being emasculated is rooted in traditional gender roles, which many might view as outdated. Modern relationships often emphasize equality and mutual support rather than one partner being the sole provider. The author's reluctance could hinder his wife's personal growth and her career development. \n\nAdditionally, the wife has already shown commitment to her current job, but now she's excited about a new path. The author's hesitation is based on his own insecurities rather than practical concerns. Supporting a partner's educational and career goals is generally seen as a positive, unless there are valid reasons like financial instability or family obligations, which aren't present here.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because he's not supporting his wife's aspirations due to his own ego, rather than her actual needs or their shared stability. The answer should be A.\n"
