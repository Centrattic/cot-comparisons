I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. The key points here are about feelings of emasculation and financial roles in the relationship.\n\nFirst, the author is male, and he's expressing discomfort about being the lower earner. His wife has the opportunity to go back to grad school, which would lead to a higher salary. He's not against her education per se, but the underlying issue is his emotional response to the potential reversal of their financial roles.\n\nI need to consider societal norms and personal values. In many traditional setups, the man being the primary breadwinner is the norm. However, modern relationships often emphasize equality. The author's feelings are personal, but the question is whether it's right to suppress his wife's ambitions based on his insecurities.\n\nThe wife's parents are funding her education, so there's no financial burden on them. The author's main issue is emotional\u2014feeling emasculated. But is it fair to expect his wife to forgo her goals for his self-esteem? That could be seen as controlling or dismissive of her aspirations.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they don't plan to have kids, so financial needs aren't an issue. The problem is his emotional need to be the higher earner. The wife seems motivated by her own dreams, which should be respected unless there's a compelling reason against it. The author's reasoning is based on his feelings rather than practical concerns.\n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, supporting each other's growth is important. If the author can't support his wife's decision because of his own insecurities, that might indicate a deeper issue in the relationship. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting her to pursue it. If the wife is making an autonomous decision, the author's objection might be invalid. But he's not forcing her; he's expressing his feelings. So maybe he's not in the wrong, but his attitude is problematic. However, the answer options are A or B. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but others might argue the opposite. The key here is whether his reasoning is valid. Since his reason is based on personal feelings and not the wife's best interest, many might say he is in the wrong (A), but if the question is about whether he's morally wrong, perhaps he's not (B). The answer hinges on whether his feelings justify the objection. The answer here is likely A, because his stance is based on ego and not the wife's aspirations. So I'll go with A.\n"
