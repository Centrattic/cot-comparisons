I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a man in his late 20s married to a woman who works but makes less than half of his salary. They don't plan to have kids, so there's no financial pressure for her to earn more. His wife put her grad school plans on hold when he was getting his degree to work full-time and support them. Now, her parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead to a higher salary than his. The wife wants to do this, but the author is against it because he feels emasculated if she makes more than him, even though they can live comfortably on his income alone.\n\nHmm. So the main issue is the author's hesitation is based on his own ego and feeling like the breadwinner. The wife already made a sacrifice by putting her education on hold to support the author during his studies. Now she wants to pursue her dream, which is supported financially by her parents. The author's concern isn't about practical reasons like financial need but about his self-esteem.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it seems like the author is prioritizing his own feelings over his wife's aspirations. A healthy relationship should support each other's goals, especially when there's no financial necessity. The fact that they can live comfortably on his income alone means that her earning more isn't a threat to their lifestyle. The author's feeling of emasculation is a personal issue, not a justification for discouraging her. The wife's parents are offering to pay, so there's no financial burden on them. The wife is trying to follow her dream, which she had previously set aside. The author's resistance seems to be about his own ego and not about her well-being or the relationship's practical needs.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because he's letting his own insecurities interfere with his wife's personal and professional growth. The answer should be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
