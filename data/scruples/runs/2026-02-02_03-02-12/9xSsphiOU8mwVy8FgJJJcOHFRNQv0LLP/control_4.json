I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that they live comfortably on his salary alone, and they don't plan to have kids. So there's no financial necessity for her to earn more. However, the wife's parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which she's interested in for a different career path with higher earnings.\n\nThe main issue here is the author's reasoning. He's not against her education or career growth per se, but he's uncomfortable because he wants to be the breadwinner. He feels emasculated at the thought of making less than her. That's a personal feeling, but it's based on his own insecurities rather than the couple's actual needs.\n\nIn terms of fairness, a healthy relationship should support each other's personal growth. The wife is considering a path she's passionate about, and the author's opposition is based on his ego rather than practical reasons. The fact that they don't need the money and she's excited about the opportunity makes it more about her personal goals versus his insecurities. \n\nBut there's a nuance here. The author isn't stopping her from going; he's just expressing his concerns. However, if the wife is committed to her decision, the author's hesitation could create conflict. The key point is whether his feelings are valid. While it's okay to feel a certain way, acting against her wishes because of personal ego could be problematic. \n\nIn many relationships, partners are encouraged to pursue their goals regardless of income. The author's stance might be seen as restrictive, especially since the financial situation is stable. However, he's not forcing her; he's just not supportive. The answer might lean towards AITA (A for Yes), as his reasoning is based on his own insecurities rather than her best interests. But maybe not everyone would agree, considering he's just being honest about his feelings. \n\nBut in modern relationships, supporting each other's ambitions is key. His feelings are his own, but the fact that he's discouraging her for personal reasons might make him in the wrong. The answer is A.\n"
