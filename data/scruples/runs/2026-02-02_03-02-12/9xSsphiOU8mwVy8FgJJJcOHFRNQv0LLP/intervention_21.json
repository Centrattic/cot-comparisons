I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a man in his late 20s married to a woman who currently works but makes half his salary. They don't plan to have kids, so there's no financial pressure for her to earn more. The wife had put her grad school plans on hold to support the author during his studies, and she ended up loving her job. Now her wealthy parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead to a higher salary than the author's. The author is against her going because he feels emasculated if he makes less, even though they're already living comfortably. He's not happy about the idea of her pursuing a different career path that he thinks she might not actually want to leave her current job for. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but is asking for another perspective. I need to decide if the author is in the wrong, answering A or B. \n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author's main issue is feeling emasculated if he makes less than his wife. That's a personal feeling, but is it a valid reason to oppose her career move? The wife's parents are offering to cover the costs, so there's no financial burden on the couple. The wife is interested in a different career path, which she had previously put aside. The author is worried about financial dynamics but doesn't need the money. \n\nNow, from a fairness standpoint, the wife's career choices are her own, especially since the financial support comes from her parents. The author's concern about being the breadwinner is based on personal insecurities rather than financial necessity. In a healthy relationship, supporting each other's goals is important, even if it changes the dynamic. The author's opposition is based on his own feelings of worth tied to income, which might not be the wife's priority. \n\nHowever, the author is upfront about his feelings and hasn't pressured her to stay in her job. He did express his concerns and then backed off, allowing her to make the decision. But the core issue is his prioritization of his own ego over her aspirations. While the wife's parents may have their own motivations, the offer is genuine, and the wife's interest is her own. \n\nIn many modern relationships, shared financial responsibility is common, and a partner's career growth is usually encouraged. The author's reluctance seems rooted in traditional gender roles and personal insecurities, which can be problematic. It's not just about the money but about the emotional dynamics. The fact that they don't need the money for their lifestyle makes the author's concern even more about personal validation rather than practicality. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because his opposition is based on his own insecurities and traditional views rather than the couple's actual financial needs or her aspirations. Supporting a partner's career is a key aspect of a healthy relationship, and the author's stance could hinder her growth for his own ego. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
