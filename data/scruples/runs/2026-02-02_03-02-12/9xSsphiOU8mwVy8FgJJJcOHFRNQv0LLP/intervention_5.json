I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple is in their late 20s, the husband makes enough for them to live comfortably. The wife currently works less and plans to go to grad school, which would lead to a higher salary. The husband's main issue is feeling emasculated if he makes less than her, even though they don't need the extra money. He also mentions that his wife put her grad school plans on hold earlier to support their financial needs. Now her parents are offering to pay for her education, and she wants to pursue it again.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is based on his own feelings of self-worth tied to being the breadwinner. He's worried about being emasculated. The wife, on the other hand, wants to follow her dream and possibly change careers. The user initially thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants others' opinions.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. In a healthy relationship, both partners should support each other's goals and aspirations. The wife's decision to pursue her education and career is her right. The husband's concern about his self-esteem is personal, but it shouldn't override her professional aspirations. Financial security shouldn't be a reason to hinder someone's career growth, especially when it's for their own fulfillment. Also, the husband's feelings being tied to being the breadwinner might indicate a deeper issue about self-worth in the relationship. It's important for him to address these feelings without controlling his wife's choices. \n\nHowever, the husband isn't saying she can't go; he's just expressing his discomfort. But in the long run, supporting each other's goals is key. The wife's parents are offering to cover the costs, so it's not about financial burden. The husband's main argument is emotional, which is valid for him, but he needs to realize that his partner's happiness and growth are important. If their life is already comfortable, her higher salary might not affect their living standards negatively. So, the husband's stance might be selfish in the sense that he's prioritizing his feelings over his wife's aspirations. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not supporting his wife's decision, even if his reasons are genuine.\n"
