I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband makes enough for both of them, and they don't plan to have kids. The wife previously gave up grad school to support him, but now her parents are offering to pay for her education, which she's excited about. The husband is against it mainly because he feels emasculated if she makes more than him, even though they can afford it.\n\nI should consider if the husband's reasons are valid. The main issue here is his emotional response based on ego. Financially, it's not about money since they can live comfortably. His objection isn't about practical reasons like financial strain or her readiness, but about his own feelings of self-worth tied to being the breadwinner. \n\nIn modern relationships, it's common for both partners to have careers, and earning more than a spouse isn't a taboo. The husband's feeling of emasculation might be a personal issue that he needs to address. Also, the wife is considering her own dreams, which is important for her personal growth and satisfaction. \n\nThe fact that they don't have kids might mean there's more flexibility for her to pursue her education. The husband's past support of her career choice when she gave up grad school shows he was okay with her current path. Now, he's hesitating because his own ego is affected, not because of financial necessity or her happiness. \n\nSo, the husband's reasoning is based on his self-esteem, not on practical concerns. It's about his feelings rather than the wife's needs or their financial situation. That makes him the one in the wrong because he's not supporting her aspirations for personal reasons. Also, the idea that a man's worth is tied to earning more than his partner is outdated and can lead to unequal dynamics in the relationship. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because his objections are based on his ego rather than valid reasons, and it's important for him to support his wife's personal and professional growth.\n"
