I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The author is a husband who's uncomfortable with his wife pursuing a career that would make her earn more than him, even though they don't need the money and they don't plan on having kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband's main issue is feeling emasculated if he's not the higher earner. The wife previously gave up grad school to support him during his studies, and now she's considering it again with her parents' financial help. The husband is worried about his self-worth tied to being the breadwinner, even though their financial situation is comfortable.\n\nThe question is whether his feelings justify being against her decision. On one hand, it's his right to have his feelings acknowledged. On the other, it's the wife's right to pursue her dreams and education, especially since they can afford it. The husband's reasoning is based on ego rather than practical needs. In modern relationships, it's common for partners to support each other's career growth regardless of income levels. The husband's hesitation might stem from traditional gender roles, which can be problematic if they hinder the partner's opportunities.\n\nAlso, the wife is making a personal choice with financial support from her parents. The husband's opposition might undermine her autonomy. While he's not the one responsible for their financial needs, his emotional response is about self-esteem, which isn't a valid reason to discourage her. Therefore, the husband is in the wrong because his feelings shouldn't override her aspirations, especially when there's no financial strain involved.\n"
