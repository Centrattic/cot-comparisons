I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a husband not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband makes enough for both of them to live comfortably, and they don't plan to have kids, so there's no financial necessity for her to earn more. The wife had put her grad school plans on hold to support him when he was in school. Now her parents are offering to pay for her education, which would lead her to a higher salary.\n\nThe husband's main issue is that he feels emasculated if he's not the breadwinner. He's honest about that, which is a key point. The wife is excited about her new path despite loving her current job. \n\nNow, from a fairness perspective, the wife is pursuing her own dreams and has the financial support from her parents. The husband's reluctance seems to stem from personal insecurities rather than practical concerns. While financial stability isn't an issue, the husband is projecting his feelings onto the situation. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, societal views might consider the husband's stance problematic because it's based on traditional gender roles and ego. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The key factors are the wife's autonomy and the husband's motivations. The husband isn't preventing her from going, just expressing his discomfort. But the underlying reason is about his self-worth being tied to his income relative to his wife's, which is a personal issue. \n\nThe wife's parents are supporting her, which adds another layer. The husband might not be in the wrong in terms of legal or ethical breaches, but morally, he's prioritizing his feelings over his wife's aspirations. So, depending on the perspective, the answer might vary. However, most modern views would likely side with the wife's autonomy and the husband's need to address his insecurities. So, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong) because his reasoning is based on personal ego rather than the wife's well-being or their relationship's health.\n"
