I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that could make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that he's the main breadwinner, and his wife currently earns less. They don't plan to have kids, so there's no immediate need for her to increase her income. The wife has already put her grad school plans on hold to support him while he got his master's. Now, her parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which could lead her to a higher salary than him.\n\nThe author's main issue seems to stem from feeling emasculated if she makes more. He admits this is an unpopular opinion but feels it's important. He also mentions that they live comfortably on his salary, so there's no financial pressure. \n\nOn one hand, supporting a partner's career goals is generally encouraged. It's about mutual respect and supporting each other's aspirations. If the wife wants to pursue her dream, even if it means earning more, that's her right. The fact that her parents are covering the costs removes financial barriers, so it's more about her personal growth and interests.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is being honest about his feelings. He's not trying to stop her outright but is hesitant. However, his reasoning is based on his own ego\u2014feeling emasculated. That's a personal issue, but it's important to consider if this feeling is valid. In modern relationships, the idea that one partner's earnings should determine the relationship's balance is outdated. It's more about teamwork and shared goals rather than who earns more.\n\nThe wife's career choice is her own, and the author's reluctance based on his own insecurities might not be a good reason to discourage her. Even though he's honest, the underlying issue is about his self-worth tied to being the breadwinner, which isn't a healthy dynamic. The fact that they don't need the money for practical reasons (no kids, comfortable living) makes her career choice more about personal fulfillment, which he should support.\n\nSo, while the author is being honest about his feelings, the core of the problem is his insecurity about his role in the relationship. The wife's right to pursue her dreams and career should take precedence. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because his reasoning is based on ego rather than supporting her aspirations.\n"
