I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author is a man who doesn't want his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. The wife's parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead to a higher salary. The author's main issue is feeling emasculated if he makes less than his wife, even though they can live comfortably on his salary alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's concern is about his self-esteem being tied to being the primary earner. That's a traditional view, and in modern relationships, equality is often emphasized. However, the situation isn't just about money. The wife is considering a significant life change\u2014going back to school for a different career path. She already put her plans on hold before to support the author's education. Now she's excited about this opportunity, which her parents are funding. \n\nThe author's reasoning is based on feeling that his role as the breadwinner gives him a sense of security and self-worth. But the wife's decision could be about her personal growth and following her dreams. The user is asking if the author is wrong for not wanting her to take this path. \n\nFrom a modern perspective, supporting each other's ambitions is usually encouraged. The fact that the author is discouraging her because of his own insecurities might be seen as selfish. However, there's no coercion mentioned here; the author says he backed off after discussing. He's not preventing her, just expressing his concerns. \n\nAlso, their financial situation is stable. The wife's higher income wouldn't create financial strain. The author's issue is more about ego than practicality. There's no mention of the wife's feelings about this. If she's pursuing her own goals, the author's hesitation is based on his feelings rather than hers. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is being honest about his feelings, but his reasoning is problematic because it's rooted in insecurity rather than the wife's best interests. The wife already made sacrifices before for his education. Now she's considering a different path, and the author's opposition is about his own self-perception. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's letting his insecurities interfere with supporting his wife's aspirations. However, it's nuanced because he's not forcing her to stay. But the core issue is his justification for not wanting her to pursue this opportunity, which is based on his ego rather than practical concerns. In a healthy relationship, both partners support each other's growth, even if it affects the traditional roles.\n"
