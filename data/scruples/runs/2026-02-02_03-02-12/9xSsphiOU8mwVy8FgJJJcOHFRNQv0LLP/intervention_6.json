I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to determine whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The question is whether it's acceptable for them to not want their wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is a man in his late 20s married to a wife who also works but earns less than half of his salary. They don't plan to have kids, so there's no financial necessity for her to increase her income. The wife had put her graduate school plans on hold during his master's to support them financially and found a job she loves. Now her wealthy parents are offering to pay for her grad school again, which could lead her to a higher salary than the author's current one.\n\nThe author's main resistance is that he feels emasculated if he makes less than her. He's okay with his current financial situation, where he's the primary breadwinner, and he's worried about making less. The wife, on the other hand, is excited about the opportunity and wants to pursue her dream despite loving her current job.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's insecurity about being the breadwinner and his wife's desire to pursue further education and a different career path. The question is whether his feelings are valid or if he's in the wrong for not supporting her.\n\nFrom a traditional perspective, some might argue that a partner's career aspirations should be supported regardless of financial implications. However, the author's concern is more about his own feelings of emasculation rather than actual financial need. The wife is not pressured to take this step for financial reasons; she wants it for her own fulfillment. The author's stance seems to stem from personal insecurities rather than practical considerations.\n\nBut is it wrong to prioritize one's own feelings over a spouse's career goals? In modern relationships, mutual support is often emphasized. If the wife wants to pursue her dream and the financial situation is stable, the author's resistance based on ego might be seen as selfish or outdated. However, the author isn't blocking her from doing it; he just expressed his concerns and the wife can still proceed if she wants. The author isn't in a position of power to prevent her, just sharing his feelings.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author's reasoning is valid. Feeling emasculated might be a common sentiment, but it's not a justification for opposing a spouse's growth. The wife's happiness and career development are important, and the author's feelings shouldn't override her aspirations. However, the author isn't actively preventing her; he's just not supportive. The question is whether not being supportive is the same as being in the wrong.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author is in the wrong for not supporting his wife's choice. Since he's allowed her to make the decision despite his reservations, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if the question is about the rightness of his feelings, then those feelings might be problematic. But the question is about being in the wrong, which implies whether his actions are justifiable. Since he hasn't stopped her and is just expressing his concerns, perhaps he's not in the wrong. But if the support he's providing is emotionally necessary for her to feel encouraged, then not supporting might be seen as wrong.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the wife's parents are funding her education, there's no financial burden on the couple, so the author's resistance isn't based on cost. Therefore, his only reason is personal insecurity. In that case, it's more about his own values and how he handles relationships. If a healthy relationship requires supporting each other's growth, then his stance might be considered wrong. However, if the wife is okay with his lack of support and still proceeds, maybe it's not his place to dictate.\n\nI think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because his reasoning is based on personal insecurity rather than practical reasons, and in a relationship, supporting each other's aspirations is important. However, some might argue he's not in the wrong if he's not actively stopping her. But the question is about being in the wrong, and his feelings are based on ego rather than her needs. So, A.\n"
