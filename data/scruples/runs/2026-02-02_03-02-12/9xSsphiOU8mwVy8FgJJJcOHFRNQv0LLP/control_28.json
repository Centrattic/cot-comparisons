I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, the author admits that his wife has a job she loves and that they live comfortably on his salary. The wife's parents are offering to pay for her graduate education, which would lead to a higher salary. The author's main issue is feeling emasculated if he makes less, even though they don't need the extra income.\n\nNow, considering gender roles and equality in relationships, it's important that both partners support each other's career goals. The author's hesitation seems to stem from ego rather than practical reasons like financial necessity or the wife's happiness. The wife is pursuing her dream, which she loves, even though her current job is different. The author's stance might be seen as undermining her autonomy and aspirations, which are key in a healthy relationship.\n\nAlso, the fact that they don't plan to have kids removes the traditional need for dual incomes. But the wife's desire to advance her career should be her own decision, not dictated by the husband's feelings about being the primary earner. The author is prioritizing his own insecurities over his wife's personal growth and happiness, which isn't fair. \n\nSociety is moving towards more equal partnerships, where financial roles don't define the relationship's strength. The author's reasoning might be outdated and could lead to resentment from the wife if she feels unsupported. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
