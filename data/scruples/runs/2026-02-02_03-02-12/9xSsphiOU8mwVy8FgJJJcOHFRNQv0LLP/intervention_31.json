I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the question) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author says he's in his late 20s, makes enough for them to live comfortably, and his wife currently works but earns less. She had put her grad school plans on hold to support them financially while he was in school. Now, her parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead to a higher salary than his. He's against it because he feels emasculated if she makes more, even though they don't need the money for kids or anything else.\n\nSo the question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he's not, but wants my opinion. The possible answers are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nI need to consider factors like personal feelings vs. autonomy. The author's reasoning is based on his own feelings of emasculation. But his wife's autonomy and her own desires are important. The wife is making a choice that's her own, potentially for her own growth or satisfaction. The author's financial support isn't necessary since they can live comfortably on his salary alone. The fact that they don't plan to have kids removes that as a financial necessity.\n\nAnother angle is whether his feelings are valid. While it's his opinion, should he be allowed to express his concerns, or is he overstepping by trying to influence her decision for his own ego? The wife's happiness and career goals might be more important than his self-esteem. Also, the fact that her parents are offering to pay for the education reduces the financial burden on the couple, so it's not about money.\n\nHowever, the author is being honest about his feelings. He might not be trying to stop her against her will, but he's expressing his discomfort. The wife is still considering it, but maybe she's aware of his feelings. However, the core issue is whether his concern about his own ego is a valid reason to discourage her.\n\nIn relationships, supporting each other's growth is usually advised. If the wife wants to pursue her dreams, even if it affects the traditional roles, it's her right. The author's feeling of being emasculated seems to be an ego issue rather than a practical one. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not supporting her decision, even if he's honest about his feelings.\n\nBut some might argue that he's not forcing her; he's just sharing his thoughts. However, the act of expressing that he feels emasculated could be influencing her decision. The question is whether his feelings justify his stance. Since the wife is making the choice herself, but the author's reasoning is about his self-worth rather than her needs, it's possible he's in the wrong.\n\nSo I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's prioritizing his own ego over his wife's personal and professional aspirations, even though they don't need the money and she has the opportunity. His justification is based on his self-esteem rather than any practical concern for the couple's well-being.\n"
