I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a higher-paying career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple is in their late 20s, financially comfortable with the husband's income. The wife previously put her grad school plans on hold to work and support them. Now, her wealthy parents are offering to fund her education, which could lead to a higher salary than his. The husband feels emasculated at the thought of making less, even though they don't need more money.\n\nThe author's reasoning is based on his own feelings of being the breadwinner and feeling emasculated if he makes less. But there are several points to consider. \n\n1. **Respect for Partner's Goals**: A key aspect of a healthy relationship is supporting each other's aspirations. By not wanting her to pursue this path, he might be undermining her personal and professional goals, even if it's for financial reasons. \n\n2. **Financial Security**: He mentions they live comfortably on his salary, so there's no financial necessity for her to earn more. However, her career choice is about her dreams, not just money. \n\n3. **Emotional vs. Practical Considerations**: His feelings of emasculation are personal but shouldn't dictate her career choices. It's important to separate his emotions from her autonomy in making decisions about her future.\n\n4. **Communication and Compromise**: The author did express his concerns, but the wife is excited about her opportunity. He needs to consider her happiness and growth, which might be more significant than his own insecurities.\n\n5. **Gender Roles and Societal Norms**: His concern about feeling emasculated reflects traditional gender roles that may not be healthy or necessary in a modern, equal partnership. Supporting each other's success regardless of income is a sign of mutual respect.\n\nIn many relationships, partners are encouraged to pursue their individual goals, and financial parity isn't a necessity. By not supporting her, he might be imposing his own insecurities onto her decisions. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because his stance is based on personal feelings rather than her best interests and personal fulfillment.\n"
