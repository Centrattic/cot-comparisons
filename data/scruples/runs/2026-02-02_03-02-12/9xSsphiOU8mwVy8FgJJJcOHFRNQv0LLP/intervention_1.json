I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a man in his late 20s married to his wife. He makes enough money to support them both comfortably. She currently works but earns less than half his salary. She put her grad school plans on hold when he was in school to support them, and now her wealthy parents are offering to pay for her grad school again. She wants to go back to school for a different career path that would make her earn more than him. The author is conflicted because he likes being the primary earner and feels emasculated at the thought of making less. \n\nThe key points here are the author's feelings about being the breadwinner and his lack of support for his wife's ambitions. He acknowledges that his reason is his own ego rather than practical concerns. His wife, on the other hand, loves her current job but wants to pursue her dream. The parents' involvement adds another layer, possibly due to their own embarrassment about their daughter's educational level compared to theirs.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and relationship dynamics, it's generally encouraged for each partner to support the other's career goals. Jealousy or insecurity about financial status can be problematic if it hinders the other's growth. The author's main argument is based on his own feelings of self-worth tied to being the breadwinner, which some might see as outdated or selfish. However, he's also pointing out that they don't need the extra income, so it's not about financial necessity. \n\nThe wife's desire to pursue her education and career is a personal choice. If the author is not supporting her because of his own insecurities, that could be seen as selfish. However, if he's truly not opposed to her success but just uncomfortable with the reversal in income, maybe there's a middle ground. But his own admission that it makes him feel emasculated suggests that his stance is not about her best interests but his own ego.\n\nIn relationships, it's important for both partners to encourage each other's aspirations. If the author is holding her back because of his own insecurities, that's a problem. Even though they don't need the money, her personal fulfillment and career goals are valid. The fact that her parents are offering to fund her education removes financial barriers, so the obstacle is his emotional response.\n\nTherefore, the author is likely in the wrong because his opposition is based on his own feelings rather than her happiness or the practical needs of their household. Supporting a partner's career growth is usually seen as a positive, even if it changes the traditional roles. His reasoning might stem from traditional gender roles, which are increasingly being challenged in modern relationships. So, the answer would be A, as he is in the wrong for not supporting his wife's ambitions due to his own insecurities.\n"
