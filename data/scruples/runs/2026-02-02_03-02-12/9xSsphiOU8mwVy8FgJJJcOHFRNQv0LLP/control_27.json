I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The husband makes enough for them to live comfortably. The wife currently works but earns less than half of his salary. She put her grad school plans on hold when he was doing his master's. Now her wealthy parents are offering to pay for her grad school in a field that would lead to a higher salary than his. The main reason the author is against it is because he feels emasculated if he's not the primary breadwinner, even though they don't need the money.\n\nSo, the ethical angle here is about supporting a partner's ambitions versus personal insecurities. The wife is making a personal career choice that's beneficial for her, but the husband is opposing it due to ego. Societally, it's becoming more accepted that both partners can have equal or varying income levels without it affecting the relationship negatively. The husband's reasoning is based on his feelings of self-worth being tied to being the higher earner, which isn't a valid reason to discourage someone from pursuing their goals. \n\nHowever, the husband does mention they don't need the money, so it's not about financial necessity. The wife's parents are funding the education, so there's no financial burden on the couple. The husband's objection is purely emotional. In healthy relationships, supporting each other's growth is important. His opposition might stem from insecurity, which isn't a good basis for a relationship decision.\n\nAlso, the wife previously put her plans on hold to support the author during his studies. Now she's considering her own dream, which the husband is resisting. This could be seen as him not respecting her autonomy and past sacrifices. The fact that the husband is the one who initially wanted to support the wife during his studies, but now is hesitant for his own ego, flips the dynamic. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the answer would likely be AITA (Author at Fault) because his reasons are selfish and based on insecurity rather than practical concerns. The wife's right to pursue her education and career should be supported, regardless of income comparison. So the author is in the wrong.\n"
