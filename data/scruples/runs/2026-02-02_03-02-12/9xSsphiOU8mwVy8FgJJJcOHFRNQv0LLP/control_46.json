I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's wife considering a career that would make her earn more than him, and the author's discomfort with that.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author makes enough for both of them to live comfortably, they don't plan to have kids, and his wife is considering going back to grad school, which would lead to a higher salary. The author's main issue is feeling emasculated if his wife makes more than him, even though they don't need the extra money. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The wife's parents offered to cover the costs, so financial burden isn't an issue there. The wife put her grad plans on hold to support the author while he was in school, but now she's excited to pursue it. The author is discouraging her because of his own insecurities about being the primary breadwinner. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's important to consider mutual respect in a relationship. The author's feelings are valid, but using them to discourage his wife from pursuing her own goals might be problematic. The wife's career choice is her own, and if she's passionate about it, the author's main objection is based on personal insecurity rather than practical reasons. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the wife loves her current job, but he's suggesting she might be better off in a different field. However, the wife is making a choice based on her own aspirations, not just financial gain. The fact that the author's reason is about ego (feeling emasculated) rather than her well-being or the couple's needs could make him the one in the wrong. \n\nSociety often has outdated views on gender roles, and the idea that a man should be the breadwinner can lead to toxic dynamics. The wife's ability to earn more should be a positive thing, showing her competence, but the author's reaction is rooted in insecurity. It's important for a partner to support each other's ambitions regardless of gender. \n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The author isn't against her education, just the career path that leads to higher earnings. But the underlying issue is his discomfort with the change in their financial roles. The wife's decision could affect their dynamic, but that's something they should work through together. The author's resistance might hinder her growth. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's feelings are understandable, his opposition to his wife's career choice based on his own ego, especially when they can afford it financially, likely puts him in the wrong. Supporting a partner's ambitions is crucial, and using personal insecurities as a reason to discourage them isn't healthy for the relationship.\n"
