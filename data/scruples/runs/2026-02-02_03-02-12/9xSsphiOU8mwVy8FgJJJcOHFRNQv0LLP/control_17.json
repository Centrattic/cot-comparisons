I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let's start by reading through the scenario again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author is a man in his late 20s married to a woman who currently works but makes less than him. He earns enough that their lives are comfortable on his salary alone. They don't plan to have kids, so there's no financial necessity for her to earn more. His wife had put her grad school plans on hold when he was getting his master's so they could be financially stable. Now, her wealthy parents have offered to pay for her grad school, which would lead to a career path where she could earn more than him. He's upset about this because he feels like he's the breadwinner and doesn't want her to make more than him, which he says would make him feel emasculated.\n\nThe key points here are his feelings of insecurity and the dynamics of their relationship. The wife is making a choice to pursue her dream, which is supported by her parents financially. The husband's main issue isn't about financial hardship but about his own ego and societal expectations about being the primary breadwinner.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's important to consider the wife's autonomy. She has the right to pursue her education and career, especially if it's something she's passionate about. The husband's concern is about his self-esteem, which is a personal issue. However, in a healthy relationship, both partners should support each other's goals and aspirations. The fact that he's not supporting her choice, even though it's in her best interest and financially feasible, could be seen as him prioritizing his own feelings over her happiness and growth.\n\nAnother angle is the financial aspect. Since they don't need her income for their lifestyle, the decision is more about her personal goals. The husband's objection is based on ego, which is a common but not necessarily justifiable reason. In many relationships, partners want to see each other succeed, regardless of income comparison. His feeling of emasculation might stem from traditional gender roles or personal insecurities, but that doesn't make him right in not supporting her.\n\nThere's also the fact that the wife had previously postponed her plans, and now she's excited to pursue them. The husband's reaction might be out of fear of change, not just about income. But the core of the issue is his unwillingness to support her decision despite it being positive for her. The question is whether his feelings make him in the wrong. In this context, the wife's right to make her own choices and the husband's failure to support her likely mean he is in the wrong. So the answer would be A for Yes.\n"
