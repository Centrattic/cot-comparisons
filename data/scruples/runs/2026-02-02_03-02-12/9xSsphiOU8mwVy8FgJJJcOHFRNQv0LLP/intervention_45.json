I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they're in their late 20s, he's the main breadwinner, and they live comfortably. The wife put her grad school plans on hold to support him when he was getting his master's. Now her parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead her to a higher salary. The author's main concern is feeling emasculated if he makes less than her. He doesn't want her to leave her current job she loves for a different path, but she's pursuing her dream.\n\nHmm. The question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he's not, but wants an opinion. Let's break it down. \n\nOn one hand, the author is being honest about his feelings. It's his right to express that he doesn't want to feel emasculated. But on the other hand, he's using his own emotions as a reason to discourage his wife from pursuing her goals. That might not be fair. The wife made sacrifices before, like putting her education on hold, and now she's getting an opportunity. Her parents are supporting her, so it's not a financial burden. \n\nThe author's argument is that they don't need the money, so she doesn't have to work. But if she wants to pursue her dream, isn't that her choice? The fact that he might feel uncomfortable making less is his personal issue, but it shouldn't override her career aspirations. True equality in a relationship would mean supporting each other's goals regardless of income. \n\nAlso, the author is projecting his own insecurities onto the relationship. He might be prioritizing his ego over her happiness and personal growth. Even though they live comfortably, her career choice is about her fulfillment, not just financial need. \n\nSo, while the author is being honest, the way he's framing his opposition might be harmful. It's possible he's not in the wrong for feeling that way, but he's definitely in the wrong for not supporting her decision based on his own insecurities. The answer likely is A, he's in the wrong.\n"
