I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The story is about a husband who doesn't want his wife to pursue a career where she'd earn more than him. The wife is offered to go back to grad school with full funding from her parents, which would lead her to a higher salary.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The husband's main issue is feeling emasculated if his wife earns more. He's the current breadwinner, and that makes him feel good. The wife put her grad school plans on hold to support him during his studies, and now she's considering this new opportunity. The husband is against it not because of financial necessity (since they don't plan to have kids and his income is sufficient) but because of his own ego.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but they want my opinion. The answer options are A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No, not in the wrong). \n\nI should consider gender roles and societal expectations. The husband's feelings about being the breadwinner are rooted in traditional gender roles. In modern relationships, both partners often contribute financially, and it's common for one to earn more than the other regardless of gender. The husband's resistance seems based on personal feelings rather than objective reasons. \n\nAlso, the wife's autonomy is important. She has her own career aspirations and the financial support from her parents to pursue them. The husband's opposition might be undermining her agency. Even though they have enough money, supporting her goals is about mutual respect and her personal growth.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is about his self-esteem tied to income. That's a personal issue, but it affects the relationship dynamics. Healthy relationships should support each other's growth, even if it challenges existing roles. The husband's reluctance to let her pursue her dream for his own ego could be seen as selfish.\n\nSo, even if the husband's feelings are valid, his actions in opposing her career choice might be in the wrong. The answer would likely be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's discouraging her aspirations for his own sake, which isn't a fair reason in a partnership.\n"
