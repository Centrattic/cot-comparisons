I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. The situation is complicated, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's main reason is that he feels emasculated if he's not the higher earner. He's the main breadwinner now, and he's used to that role. But his wife's parents are offering to cover her grad school, which would lead her to a higher salary. She's excited about this path, even though it's different from her current job. They don't have kids, so financial necessity isn't an issue.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the wife's desire to pursue her dream should be respected. The author's feelings about being the breadwinner are his own, but that shouldn't override her aspirations. Also, financial support from her parents means the decision isn't just about money. The fact that the author is more focused on his own ego than her happiness seems problematic. \n\nHowever, maybe there are valid concerns about the transition. But he hasn't expressed those; he's just focused on his personal feelings. The key here is whether his objection is valid. Since the wife is making a choice that aligns with her goals and their financial situation allows it, the author's resistance is based on his self-esteem rather than practical reasons. That makes him the one in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
