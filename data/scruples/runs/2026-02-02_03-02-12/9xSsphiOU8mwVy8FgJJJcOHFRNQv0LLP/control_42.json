I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. The situation involves complex dynamics around gender roles, financial expectations, and personal values.\n\nFirst, the author admits that his wife's parents offered to pay for her graduate education, which would lead to a higher salary. He's against her going because he feels it would make him feel emasculated, even though they can live comfortably on his income. The wife has already put her grad school plans on hold to support the relationship, and now she's reconsidering because of her parents' offer.\n\nFrom a traditional viewpoint, some might argue that supporting a partner's career is important for their happiness and growth. The author's concern about being the breadwinner might stem from societal norms that equate financial provision with masculinity. However, in modern relationships, many prioritize equality and mutual support regardless of income levels. The author's hesitation could be seen as imposing his own insecurities onto his wife's decisions, especially since she's passionate about her dreams.\n\nAnother angle is the financial aspect. Since they don't plan to have children and currently live comfortably on his salary, the economic necessity isn't there. The wife's pursuit of education for a higher salary might be more about her personal fulfillment than financial need. The author's resistance might undermine her autonomy and self-worth, which could harm their relationship trust and communication.\n\nHowever, the author isn't necessarily being malicious. He's being honest about his feelings, even if they aren't socially acceptable. There's a balance between respecting a partner's aspirations and managing one's own emotions. The key issue here is whether his feelings should override her desires. If the wife wants this path, and the author is blocking her due to personal insecurity, that could be problematic. But if they can find a compromise, maybe there's a middle ground.\n\nConsidering ethical perspectives, supporting a partner's education and career is often seen as a positive. The author's main issue is his own ego, which could be a sign of deeper insecurities. The answer might lean towards AITA being guilty because he's prioritizing his feelings over her potential growth. However, the situation isn't entirely black and white since he's being honest and they have financial stability. But ultimately, the wife's right to pursue her goals is a significant factor here.\n"
