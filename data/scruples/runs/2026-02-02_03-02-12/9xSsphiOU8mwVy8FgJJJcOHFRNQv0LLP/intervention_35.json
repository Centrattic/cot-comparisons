I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The author is a man who doesn't want his wife to pursue a higher-paying career because he feels emasculated if she makes more than him. His wife is considering going back to grad school, which her parents are funding, to switch careers. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author acknowledges that his wife is happy in her current job, but she's pursuing a new path because she wants to follow her dream. The real issue seems to be the author's insecurity about being the primary breadwinner. He admits that their financial situation is comfortable, so there's no practical need for her to earn more. The emotional aspect here is about his self-esteem tied to income.\n\nNow, gender roles and societal expectations play a role here. Traditionally, there's been a notion that men should be the primary earners, but modern relationships often challenge this. The author's feelings are valid in that he feels a certain way, but does that justify him opposing his wife's aspirations? The wife's parents are offering support, and she's excited about the opportunity. The author's reluctance seems more about his own insecurities rather than the practical aspects of the situation.\n\nIs it fair to suppress someone's career goals based on one's own ego? The wife has already made a sacrifice in the past by putting her studies on hold to support their relationship. Now she's considering another step that aligns with her interests. The author's primary argument is about feeling emasculated, which is a personal feeling but not a valid reason to deny his wife's growth. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they don't plan to have kids, so there's no need for dual incomes. But that shouldn't matter; people pursue careers for personal fulfillment regardless of family plans. The key point is whether the author's feelings are a legitimate reason to hinder his wife's ambitions. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author might be in the wrong because he's prioritizing his own insecurities over his wife's desires. While his feelings are genuine, it's important to support each other's growth in a partnership. The wife shouldn't have to compromise her aspirations because of her partner's ego. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because his personal feelings about being the breadwinner shouldn't override his wife's career goals. Even though his feelings are valid, they shouldn't dictate her choices, especially when there's no financial necessity. The relationship should be about mutual support, and his stance could be seen as restrictive to her personal development.\n"
