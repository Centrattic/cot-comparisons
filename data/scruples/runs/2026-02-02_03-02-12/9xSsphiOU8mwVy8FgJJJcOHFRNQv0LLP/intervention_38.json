I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong (AITA). The author is a husband who's uncomfortable with his wife pursuing a career that might make her earn more than him. The main points are:\n\n1. The wife previously put her grad school plans on hold to support the author financially while he got his master's.\n2. Now, her wealthy parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead to a higher salary.\n3. The author feels emasculated at the thought of being the lower earner, even though they currently live comfortably on his salary.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The author's feelings about being the breadwinner are personal but might be based on societal expectations. The wife is following her own ambitions, which were set aside earlier for his education. Her parents' support removes financial barriers, making her decision more about her own goals.\n\nThe key issue is whether the husband's opposition is valid. His reasons are about his self-esteem and societal norms, not practical concerns like financial strain. The wife is choosing a path she loves, which could be beneficial for her personally. The husband's discomfort seems to stem from ego rather than a valid reason. In a healthy relationship, supporting each other's aspirations is crucial. The husband's resistance might be seen as undermining her autonomy and the previous sacrifice she made for him. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because his feelings shouldn't override her right to pursue her goals, especially when there's no financial necessity involved. The answer should be A.\n"
