I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the husband not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him, even though they can already live comfortably on his salary.\n\nFirst, the husband's reasons: he feels good about being the breadwinner and would feel emasculated if he made less. He also mentions that they don't need more money since they're already doing well. The wife put her grad school plans on hold to support the relationship, and now her wealthy parents are offering to pay for her education. The wife wants to go back for her dream, which is a different career path.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but the question is whether he is. So, I need to evaluate if his reasons are valid or if they're based on outdated or harmful gender roles. \n\nThe husband's concern about feeling emasculated because of societal expectations or personal insecurities might be problematic. Gender roles have evolved, and it's not uncommon for one partner to earn more than the other. The fact that they can live comfortably on his salary complicates things. The wife's desire to pursue her dream and advance her career could be seen as her right to personal growth and fulfillment, regardless of financial implications. \n\nHowever, the husband's perspective might stem from personal insecurities rather than practical needs. Also, the wife's parents' motivations (embarrassment) might not be a solid foundation for her decision. The husband should ideally support her in her ambitions unless there are other valid concerns like financial strain, but since the parents are covering costs, that's not an issue here. \n\nOn the flip side, the husband's role as the breadwinner might be a source of pride for him, and he's being honest about his feelings. But is it fair for him to impose his feelings on her choices? The key here is whether his reasons are selfish or if they have a valid basis. Since the couple doesn't need the money, the husband's objection is more about his ego than practicality. \n\nSociety is moving towards valuing personal fulfillment and equality in relationships. The husband's stance could be seen as holding back his wife's potential for his own ego. Even if it's his honest feeling, the right thing to do might be to support her, even if it makes him uncomfortable. \n\nSo, in terms of right and wrong, the husband's perspective is based on personal feelings, but the wife has the right to pursue her goals. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for letting his insecurities affect her decisions.\n"
