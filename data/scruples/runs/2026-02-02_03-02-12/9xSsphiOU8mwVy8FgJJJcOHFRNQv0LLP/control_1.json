I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author is a guy who's uncomfortable with his wife pursuing a career that would make her earn more than him. They don't have kids, and he's the main breadwinner. His wife's parents offered to pay for her grad school, which would lead to a higher salary.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is expressing that his feelings about being the breadwinner are important to him, and he feels emasculated if he makes less. But the wife is interested in her dream and has support from her parents. The author's main objection is based on his own ego and self-esteem rather than practical reasons like financial necessity or the wife's well-being.\n\nIn relationships, it's often about mutual support and respecting each other's goals. The author's hesitation seems to stem from personal insecurity rather than valid concerns about their financial stability, since the couple is already living comfortably. The wife's career choice is her own, and the fact that her parents are supporting it adds another layer. The author's role isn't necessarily tied to being the sole breadwinner, especially since they don't have children. \n\nSociety is moving towards more equality in partnerships, and valuing a partner's aspirations is crucial. The author's feelings are valid in the sense that he's feeling threatened, but the wife's right to pursue her education and career should be respected. The answer likely hinges on whether the author's reasoning is based on selfishness versus the wife's autonomy. Since the author is prioritizing his own ego over his wife's aspirations without a practical reason, he's probably in the wrong. So, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
