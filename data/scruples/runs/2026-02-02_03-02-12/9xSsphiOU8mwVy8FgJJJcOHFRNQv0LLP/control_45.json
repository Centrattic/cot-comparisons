I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that could make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, looking at the situation: The wife already chose to put her grad school plans on hold to support the couple financially. Now, with her parents' financial backing, she's considering a different path that might lead her to a higher salary. The husband's main objection is that he feels emasculated by the prospect of her making more than him, even though they don't need the extra money.\n\nThe key points here are about self-worth and support in the relationship. The husband's concern is based on his personal feelings rather than any practical need. The wife's decision to pursue her dream shouldn't be hindered by her partner's insecurities. In healthy relationships, partners encourage each other's growth. The husband's reaction might stem from societal expectations around gender roles, which can be problematic. It's important to note that financial contributions shouldn't dictate a person's value in a relationship. The husband should address his feelings without imposing them on his wife's choices. Supporting each other's individual goals is crucial for mutual respect and a balanced partnership. Therefore, the husband is in the wrong because he's letting his personal insecurities affect his wife's career aspirations.\n"
