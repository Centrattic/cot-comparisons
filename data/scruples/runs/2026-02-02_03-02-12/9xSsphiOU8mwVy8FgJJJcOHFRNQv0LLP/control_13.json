I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether it's okay for him to not want his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the wife is considering going back to grad school, which her parents are funding. She previously put her studies on hold to support the couple financially while he was in his master's. Now, she wants to pursue a different career path that might make her earn more than him. The husband is against it because he feels emasculated by the idea of her making more and he's the one supporting them now. They don't plan to have kids, so there's no financial pressure.\n\nHmm, the key points here are his feelings about being the breadwinner and his insecurity about making less. But is it fair for him to impose his feelings on her career choices? The wife is making her own decision here, and the husband's reasoning seems to be based on his own ego rather than practical considerations. They already live comfortably on his income, so there's no financial need for her to earn more. However, her personal fulfillment is a big part of this. She loves her current job but wants to pursue her dream, which could be important for her happiness and personal growth.\n\nAlso, the husband's reaction is coming from a place of insecurity rather than any logical objection. The fact that he's worried about feeling emasculated if she earns more is a traditional gender role issue. In a healthy relationship, both partners should support each other's goals, especially when there's no financial necessity. The wife is making a choice that's about her own aspirations, and the husband is hindering her because of his own feelings. That seems unfair.\n\nMoreover, the wife's parents are offering to cover the costs, so there's no financial burden on the couple for her to go back to school. The husband isn't arguing against the feasibility of the plan but is instead focused on his own emotional response. That suggests he's in the wrong because his concern is about his self-esteem, not her success or the couple's well-being.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because his opposition is based on his own insecurities rather than supporting his wife's aspirations. A healthy relationship should encourage each other's growth, regardless of financial dynamics.\n"
