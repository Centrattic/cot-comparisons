I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The author is a husband who doesn't want his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. The wife's parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead to a higher salary. The husband is concerned about his role as the breadwinner and feels emasculated at the thought of making less.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband acknowledges that his wife's parents are wealthier and that she put her education on hold to support them financially. Now, she's rethinking her plans. The husband's main issue seems to be his own ego and traditional gender roles. He feels that being the sole breadwinner is important for his self-esteem. \n\nOn one hand, the wife has a right to pursue her education and career goals. She already delayed her grad school once, and now she has the opportunity to do so without financial burden. Her parents' offer is a significant factor here. The husband's resistance is based on personal feelings rather than practical reasons like financial necessity or her happiness. \n\nHowever, the husband is upfront about his feelings. He didn't outright forbid her, but he expressed his concerns. The question is whether his feelings are valid. While it's important to support a partner's ambitions, the husband's reasoning is rooted in insecurity about his role and societal expectations. \n\nIn modern relationships, financial roles are more flexible, and it's common for both partners to work and earn similar or different incomes. The husband's concern about feeling emasculated is a personal issue, not a valid reason to discourage his wife from advancing her career. The key here is whether the husband is being selfish or supporting his wife's growth. \n\nThe wife's decision could affect their relationship dynamics, but if she's passionate about her studies and the opportunity is there, it's her choice. The husband's stance might lead to resentment if she feels pressured to prioritize his ego over her aspirations. \n\nSo, the answer is likely AITA in the husband's favor? Or is he in the wrong? The husband is not wrong in expressing his feelings, but his reasoning is flawed. He's projecting his own insecurities onto the situation. The right approach would be to support her decision and discuss how to navigate the shift in their roles. Since he's not forcing her, but still expressing discomfort, it's a gray area. However, the core issue is his ego, which is a personal problem. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he's prioritizing his own feelings over his wife's aspirations and potential happiness.\n"
