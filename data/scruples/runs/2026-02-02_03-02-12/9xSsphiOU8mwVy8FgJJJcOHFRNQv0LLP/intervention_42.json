I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. The situation involves the wife considering going back to grad school, which would shift their financial roles.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The man is the primary breadwinner, and he feels good about supporting them both. His concern is about feeling emasculated if she makes more. The wife, on the other hand, has a job she loves but is considering a different path for her own aspirations. Her parents are financially supporting her education, which adds another layer because their motivation might be their own pride, not just her best interest.\n\nThe user initially thought the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. The key points are: the man's feelings about financial roles, the wife's career aspirations, and the financial stability of the couple. The man's reasons are based on his self-esteem and societal expectations, which might be problematic. Modern views often emphasize equality and supporting each other's career growth regardless of income. However, the man's perspective is that he's not opposed to her education but the career change would lead to her earning more, which makes him uncomfortable.\n\nIt's important to assess whether his reasons are valid. Feeling emasculated due to being the lower earner can be a personal issue, but in a partnership, mutual support is key. The wife's decision to pursue her dream could be a right she has, and the husband's opposition based on his ego might be a reason he's in the wrong. However, if they are both comfortable and it's not about financial necessity, maybe it's a personal choice. But the question is about whether the author is wrong.\n\nIn many cases, respecting a partner's aspirations is crucial. If the husband's objection is purely about his own feelings rather than practical concerns (like financial stability or the wife's well-being), then it's a problem. The fact that the wife already has a job she loves and the new path is different might affect her satisfaction. The husband should support her if she's making an informed decision, even if it changes their dynamic. Therefore, the author's stance might stem from insecurity rather than genuine concern for her, which could make him at fault.\n"
