I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The husband makes enough for them to live comfortably. His wife works but earns less. They don't plan to have kids. She previously put grad school on hold to support him during his studies. Now, her parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which could lead her to earn more than him. He's concerned about being the breadwinner and feeling emasculated, even though they don't need the money.\n\nHmm. The husband's main issue seems to be his own ego. He's not concerned about financial necessity but about his self-esteem tied to being the higher earner. The wife, on the other hand, is pursuing her dream, which she loves, even though it's different from her current job. She had to put her plans aside before, and now she has the opportunity again.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the husband's feelings are valid, but they stem from traditional gender roles. Modern perspectives often emphasize supporting each other's ambitions regardless of income. The wife has the right to pursue her education and career goals. The husband's resistance is based on personal insecurities rather than practical reasons. \n\nHowever, communication is key here. The husband expressed his concerns, and the wife should consider his feelings, but he should also respect her autonomy. The question is whether his stance makes him \"in the wrong.\" Since his reasoning is about his own ego rather than the wife's well-being or their financial stability, he's likely in the wrong. The wife's aspirations shouldn't be secondary to his need to feel superior financially. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because his opposition is based on his own insecurities rather than valid concerns for their relationship or her well-being.\n"
