I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted this is in the wrong. The situation involves the husband not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The husband makes enough for both of them to live comfortably. The wife is currently working but earning less. She had put her grad school plans on hold to support him during his studies. Now, her wealthy parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead to a higher salary. The husband's main issue is feeling emasculated if he's not the sole breadwinner.\n\nThe key factors here are the husband's reasons. He admits it's about his ego and feeling good about being the breadwinner. That's a personal issue, but does that make him wrong? In terms of fairness and support, a healthy relationship should encourage each other's growth. The wife is pursuing her dream, and the husband's reluctance is based on his own insecurities rather than practical concerns like financial necessity or her happiness.\n\nAlso, the couple doesn't plan to have kids, so there's no financial pressure. The husband's stance seems to be about maintaining a traditional dynamic, but in a modern context, equality in partnerships is often valued more. The wife's parents are supporting her education, which is a positive opportunity for her. Restricting her growth for his own ego might be seen as selfish.\n\nHowever, the husband isn't outright forbidding her; he expressed his concerns. But the wife's happiness and career aspirations should be her priority. The husband's feelings are valid, but his justification is based on pride rather than practical reasons. Therefore, it's likely that he's in the wrong because he's prioritizing his ego over his wife's aspirations and potentially her happiness.\n"
