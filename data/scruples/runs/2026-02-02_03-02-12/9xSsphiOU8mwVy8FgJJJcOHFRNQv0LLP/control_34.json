I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author makes enough for both of them to live comfortably, and his wife currently earns less. Her parents offer to pay for her grad school, which could lead to her making more. The author's main issue is feeling emasculated if he's not the higher earner. He feels like he supports the relationship financially, which makes him feel good.\n\nNow, the question is whether his feelings are valid. From a relationship perspective, supporting each other's career goals is important. If the wife wants to pursue her dream, even if it's a different path, the husband's resistance might be based on personal insecurity rather than practical reasons. The fact that they don't plan to have kids and already live comfortably suggests that her career choice shouldn't be a financial necessity. \n\nThe husband's reasoning centers around his own ego. He admits that feeling emasculated is the main issue. That's a personal issue rather than something that justifies stopping his wife from pursuing her ambitions. Healthy relationships should encourage mutual growth. If the wife is excited about school and her new career path, the husband's opposition could be seen as selfish or controlling. \n\nAlso, there's the aspect of the wife's previous sacrifice. She put her grad school plans on hold to work and support them when he was in school. Now, he's not supporting her decision to go back, which might be unfair. It could create resentment. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, while traditional gender roles might have dictated the man as the sole breadwinner, modern relationships often prioritize individual goals. The husband's stance might be outdated and could harm the relationship's equality. \n\nHowever, there's a nuance that the wife is making a significant career change. The husband did mention discussing her current job satisfaction and the different career path, but his underlying reason is about his own feelings. That's where the problem lies. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the husband is in the wrong because he's prioritizing his ego over his wife's aspirations. The answer should be A.\n"
