I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the situation) is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author's wife wanting to pursue a graduate degree that could make her earn more than him. The author feels it would make him feel emasculated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is a man in a relationship where he's the primary or sole breadwinner. He supports his wife financially. Now, her wealthy parents offer to pay for her grad school, which could lead her to a higher salary. The author is against this because he feels it would make him feel like the \"less\" one in the relationship. The wife, on the other hand, wants to pursue her dream despite loving her current job.\n\nHmm, the main issue here is the author's emotional response based on societal expectations of masculinity. He's worried about feeling emasculated if his wife earns more. But is that a valid reason to prevent her from pursuing her goals? Also, the wife's parents are offering to cover the costs, so there's no financial burden on them. They don't need the money, so it's more about personal and emotional reasons.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the wife is choosing her path, which she's passionate about. The author is discouraging her based on his own insecurities. That seems a bit self-centered. The wife had previously postponed her grad school plans to support him, so maybe she's now asserting her own desires. The author should support her, regardless of the financial aspect. Financial roles in a relationship shouldn't dictate personal growth or career aspirations. It's more about mutual support and respect for each other's goals.\n\nThe author's argument is that he's comfortable with being the breadwinner and it makes him feel good. But in a healthy relationship, each partner's individual aspirations should be encouraged. Feeling emasculated because of the other's success is a traditional and outdated view. The wife's happiness and fulfillment should be prioritized over his insecurities.\n\nAlso, considering that they don't plan to have kids and their current financial situation is stable, there's no practical reason why she shouldn't pursue her education. The author's stance is based on personal feelings rather than practical concerns. The wife is making a decision that's right for her, and the author's opposition seems to stem from his own ego rather than the family's best interests.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because he's projecting his insecurities onto the relationship and not supporting his wife's aspirations. It's important for partners to encourage each other's growth, even if it changes the dynamic of their finances.\n"
