I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband who doesn't want his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. The key points here are about gender roles, personal feelings, and the dynamics in their relationship.\n\nFirst, the husband admits that his main issue is feeling emasculated if he makes less than his wife. He's okay with them living comfortably on his salary, but he's uncomfortable with the idea of her earning more. This seems to stem from traditional gender role expectations where the man is the primary breadwinner. However, in modern relationships, it's common for both partners to have careers and earn similar or varying incomes without it affecting their relationship negatively.\n\nThe wife had put her graduate school plans aside earlier to support the husband during his studies. Now, her parents are offering to fund her education again, and she wants to pursue it. The husband is against it not because of financial necessity (since they don't need more money), but because of his own ego. This could be seen as selfish because he's prioritizing his feelings over his wife's career aspirations and personal growth.\n\nAlso, the husband's reasoning that no man can feel \"good enough\" if his wife makes more is a traditional viewpoint that doesn't hold in many contemporary relationships. Healthy relationships are built on mutual respect and support for each other's goals, regardless of income levels. By not supporting his wife's decision, the husband might be undermining her autonomy and her right to pursue her dreams.\n\nMoreover, the wife is changing careers to follow her dream, which is a significant life decision. The husband's opposition based on his own insecurities could be considered invalidating her personal aspirations. The fact that they don't plan to have kids removes the argument about financial necessity, making the husband's stance even more about his own ego than practical concerns.\n\nIn summary, the husband's primary issue is his own discomfort with not being the higher earner, despite the couple's financial stability. This puts him at a disadvantage because it shows a lack of support for his wife's ambitions and a reliance on outdated gender roles. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
