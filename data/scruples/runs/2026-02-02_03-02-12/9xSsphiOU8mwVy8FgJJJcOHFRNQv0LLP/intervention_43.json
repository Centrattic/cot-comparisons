I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that could make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, the author's perspective is that he's the primary breadwinner, and he feels good about supporting his wife. He doesn't want her to go back to grad school because it would lead her to earn more than him. He mentions feeling emasculated if he made less than her. The key points here are his feelings about being the breadwinner and his insecurity about making less.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife put her grad school plans on hold to support him during his master's. Now, with her parents offering to pay for her education, she's excited about a new path. The author is against it because of his personal feelings rather than practical reasons like financial necessity or her happiness.\n\nThe wife's situation is important too. She's been in a job she loves but now has an opportunity to pursue a different career. Her parents' involvement might add pressure, but the main issue is the husband's resistance based on his ego. \n\nSociety often expects men to be the primary earners, but this is changing. The husband's reasoning is based on personal insecurity rather than the couple's actual needs. They don't need more money since they live comfortably, so the issue isn't financial necessity. The husband's stance could hinder his wife's personal growth and career aspirations, which is a significant point against him. \n\nThe fact that the husband's primary objection is his own feelings about being the breadwinner, not the practical implications for their relationship, suggests that he's prioritizing his ego over his wife's ambitions. This could be seen as selfish or disrespectful to her goals. \n\nSo, while it's understandable that people might feel a certain way about their role in the relationship, the husband is in the wrong because his feelings are causing him to discourage his wife from pursuing her own dreams for personal reasons. The right approach would be to support her decision, even if it changes their financial dynamics. Therefore, the answer is AITA, meaning the husband is in the wrong.\n"
