I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him, even though they can live comfortably on his salary alone. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons the author gives. He mentions feeling emasculated if his wife earns more, and that he likes being the breadwinner. His wife's parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which is a path to a higher salary. The wife is excited about this opportunity and her dream.\n\nFrom a fairness and equality standpoint, it's problematic for the author to discourage his wife from pursuing her career goals because of his own ego. The wife's aspirations should be respected, especially since they don't need the money for living expenses. The author's reasoning is based on his personal feelings rather than any practical need. \n\nAlso, the wife previously put her education on hold to support the relationship, which shows she made a sacrifice. Now, she's considering it again, possibly because of her own interests. The author shouldn't be the one to dictate her career choices based on his insecurities. \n\nSocietal norms are changing, and it's more about mutual support in a relationship rather than traditional gender roles. The author's concern about feeling \"good enough\" is his own issue, not a valid reason to stop his wife from advancing her career. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because he's prioritizing his self-esteem over his wife's aspirations and potential. The answer should be A.\n"
