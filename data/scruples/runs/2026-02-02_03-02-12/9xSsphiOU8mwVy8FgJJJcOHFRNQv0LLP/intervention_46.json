I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author makes a good salary, and they live comfortably without kids. The wife had put her grad school plans on hold to work full-time and support them. Now, her parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead to a higher salary than the author's current one.\n\nThe author's main concern is feeling emasculated if he's the lower earner. He's worried about his self-esteem tied to being the breadwinner. But the wife is excited and wants to pursue her dream. The key points here are his emotional reasons versus her aspirations. \n\nFrom a traditional perspective, some might see the husband's stance as outdated, prioritizing his ego over his wife's goals. However, others might argue that his feelings are valid and that there's no harm in wanting to maintain the current financial dynamic. But the issue is whether it's wrong to inhibit her pursuit of a better career just because of his own insecurities.\n\nMarriage is about mutual respect and support. If the husband is discouraging her growth because of his own ego, that could be problematic. Even if their financial situation is stable, her career choice is hers to make. The husband's reasoning seems to center on his self-worth being tied to his earnings, which is a personal issue but might not be fair to her. \n\nHowever, the husband didn't outright block her; he expressed his concerns. The wife is still considering her own happiness. The question is whether his feelings are a valid reason to dissuade her. In modern relationships, individual growth is encouraged. The husband's stance could be seen as undermining her autonomy. \n\nSo, while his feelings are understandable, the fact that he's not in a position where they need the money and she's pursuing her dream, the answer might lean towards AITA (A: the author is in the wrong). But I need to check if there's any nuance I missed. The wife might not need the money, but she wants the career. His reasons are self-centered. Therefore, the answer is likely A.\n"
