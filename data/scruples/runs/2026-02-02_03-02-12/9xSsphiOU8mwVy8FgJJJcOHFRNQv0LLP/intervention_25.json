I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The question is about whether it's okay for the husband to not want his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The husband makes enough for both of them to live comfortably. His wife currently earns less than half of that. She worked during his master's but put her grad school plans on hold. Now her parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead her to a higher salary than him. The husband is against it because he feels emasculated if she makes more. They don't plan to have kids, so there's no need for financial growth.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about personal feelings versus the wife's autonomy. The husband's reasons are based on his self-esteem and the dynamic of being the breadwinner. But is that a valid reason to discourage his wife from pursuing her goals? \n\nIn terms of ethics, personal feelings shouldn't override another person's career aspirations unless there's a compelling reason. Since there's no financial necessity, and the wife is excited about her dream, the husband's objection seems based on his own insecurities. It might be considered wrong for him to hinder her potential growth just because of his ego. \n\nBut the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Maybe they believe the husband's feelings are understandable. However, in a relationship, supporting each other's goals is important. If the husband is making her feel her choice isn't supported, that could be a problem. The fact that he's the main breadwinner doesn't give him the right to restrict her opportunities. \n\nAlso, the wife already put her plans on hold before. Now she's interested again, which might be her time to pursue it. The husband's reaction might be dismissive, not considering her desires. So, from a fairness perspective, he's in the wrong because it's her career and her parents are helping. His insecurity shouldn't dictate her path. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's prioritizing his own feelings over his wife's aspirations without valid reasons. Supporting each other's growth is a key aspect of a healthy relationship, and his objection seems selfish here.\n"
