I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him.\n\nFirst, the author is a man in his late 20s, married, and currently the sole breadwinner. His wife has a job but earns less than half of what he does. They don't plan to have kids, so there's no financial need for her to earn more. The wife's parents offered to pay for her grad school, which would lead her to a higher-paying job. The author is against this because he feels it would make him feel emasculated if she makes more than him.\n\nThe key points here are the author's motivations. He's not opposed to her going to school or pursuing a career for practical reasons like financial necessity. Instead, his main issue is about ego and feeling that being the lower earner would make him feel less of a man. He acknowledges that this is an unpopular opinion. \n\nNow, considering societal norms and values, many people advocate for gender equality in relationships, including financial independence for both partners. The author's stance might be seen as traditional or even regressive because it's based on his self-worth being tied to being the higher earner. His wife's decision to pursue her own career and education is her right, and the author's resistance is more about his personal feelings rather than her well-being or aspirations.\n\nAlso, the wife's parents are offering to cover the costs, so there's no financial burden on the couple. The author's argument that they don't need the extra money because they live comfortably doesn't negate her desire to pursue a new path. The fact that she loves her current job but still wants to follow her dream shows her motivation is personal, not just about money.\n\nIn healthy relationships, supporting each other's growth is important. The author's reluctance based on ego might hinder his wife's personal development. While he claims to back off after talking, the underlying reason (feeling emasculated) could lead to resentment or conflict over time. The question is whether his feelings justify holding her back from her goals.\n\nMost people would argue that the author is in the wrong because his reasoning is based on insecurity rather than practical concerns. It's about respecting her autonomy and supporting her aspirations regardless of how it affects his ego. The answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
