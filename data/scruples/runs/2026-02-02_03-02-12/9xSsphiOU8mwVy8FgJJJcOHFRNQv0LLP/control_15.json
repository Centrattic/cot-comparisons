I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their wife to pursue a higher-paying career. The author's main reason is that he feels emasculated if he makes less than her, even though they live comfortably on his salary.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife already chose to put her grad plans on hold to work full-time supporting them, and now her parents are offering to pay for her education. The author is worried about being the breadwinner, which seems more about his self-esteem than financial necessity since they don't need the money. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the wife should have the right to pursue her dreams and education regardless of her partner's feelings. The author's concern is about his ego, not financial strain. That could make him wrong (A) because it's about his insecurities rather than practical reasons. But maybe the user wants to consider the context where they don't need the money, so the wife's decision is personal growth. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author isn't forcing her but is expressing his feelings, maybe it's not his place to decide for her. However, his reasoning seems to stem from a place of insecurity, which is a personal issue. The answer might be A because he's projecting his feelings onto her decision, which she's entitled to make regardless of his ego. But some might argue that he's not in the wrong if he's honest about his feelings. However, the question is if he's in the wrong for opposing her career choice. Since the wife's autonomy is important, the answer leans towards A.\n"
