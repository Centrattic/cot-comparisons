I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the wife wanting to pursue a graduate degree that would lead to a higher salary than the husband's, and the husband not wanting her to do that because he feels it would make him feel emasculated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband is making enough for both of them, and they don't plan on having kids, so financial necessity isn't a factor. The wife had put her education on hold to support the husband during his master's, which he acknowledges. Now she's considering going back to school, and the husband is resistant not because of financial reasons but because of his own ego.\n\nFrom a traditional standpoint, some might argue that supporting a partner's career is important, even if it changes the financial dynamic. But the husband is upfront about his feelings of emasculation, which is a personal issue. The question is whether his feelings justify him opposing his wife's decision to pursue her dream, especially when she's financially supported by her parents.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is based on his personal insecurities rather than practical concerns. The wife is making a choice that aligns with her desires and has the financial backing from her parents. The husband's role here is more about his emotional response rather than the actual financial situation. It's possible that his stance could hinder his wife's personal growth and career aspirations, which might be seen as unfair or selfish.\n\nHowever, the husband isn't stopping her; he's just expressing his discomfort. The wife is still making the decision herself. But the root issue is the husband's insecurity about his role as the breadwinner. That could be a sign of deeper issues in the relationship, like unequal power dynamics or unaddressed insecurities.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, many people advocate for equal career opportunities in relationships, regardless of income. The husband's desire to maintain a specific role (the breadwinner) might conflict with modern values that emphasize mutual support and individual growth. However, the husband isn't forcing her to stay; it's her choice. Still, his feelings might influence her decision indirectly.\n\nAnother angle is that the husband's financial situation allows them to support her education without strain. His parents' financial help removes the burden of debt, making it feasible. So, the husband's resistance isn't based on practical concerns but emotional ones. That makes his stance more about his own ego than the practicality of their situation.\n\nIn conclusion, the husband's opposition is rooted in personal insecurities rather than objective reasons. While his feelings are valid, they shouldn't override his wife's aspirations. Therefore, he might be in the wrong because he's prioritizing his ego over his wife's career goals, which could be seen as selfish. However, since he's not actively preventing her, it's a nuanced situation. The key point is whether his feelings of emasculation are a legitimate reason to discourage her. Given that the wife is making the choice herself and the financial aspect isn't an issue, the husband's stance is more about his own issues than her well-being. So, the answer is A (he is in the wrong).\n"
