I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the person who posted the question (AITA) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are: both are in their late 20s, he's currently the higher earner, they don't plan to have kids, and his wife is considering grad school funded by her wealthy parents. He's uncomfortable with the idea because he feels emasculated if she makes more. \n\nThe user initially thought the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to form my own opinion. The main issue here is about gender roles and self-esteem. The husband's concern is about his role as the primary breadwinner, which affects his self-worth. However, healthy relationships are built on mutual support and respect for each other's aspirations. If his opposition stems from insecurity rather than valid concerns about their lifestyle or financial stability, that's problematic.\n\nAlso, the wife's parents funding her education removes the financial burden, so practical arguments like cost aren't valid here. The husband's main reason is emotional (feeling emasculated), which is a personal issue that shouldn't dictate his wife's career choices. In modern contexts, it's important for partners to support each other's growth regardless of income levels. \n\nThe husband's argument that they don't need more money because they live comfortably is a point, but pursuing a higher salary isn't just about money\u2014it's about personal fulfillment and career goals. The husband is essentially prioritizing his ego over his wife's happiness and professional aspirations. \n\nTherefore, the husband is in the wrong because his stance is based on outdated gender roles and personal insecurity, not genuine financial necessity or support for his wife's goals. The right approach would be to encourage her to pursue her dreams, regardless of income levels.\n"
