I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario is about a husband who doesn't want his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. The wife is considering going back to graduate school, which would lead to a higher salary. The husband's main issue is feeling emasculated if he's not the breadwinner.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The husband acknowledges his reasoning is unpopular but feels it's about his self-esteem. The wife is supported financially by the husband, and they don't plan to have kids, so there's no financial pressure. The wife's parents are offering to pay for her education, which might be a factor. The husband's concern is about his role as the breadwinner making him feel good.\n\nI should consider the values here. The wife has a right to pursue her dreams and education. The husband's feelings about being the breadwinner might be based on traditional gender roles or personal insecurities. However, in a healthy relationship, supporting each other's goals is important. If the husband is discouraging her for his own ego, that could be problematic. \n\nThe question is whether his reason is valid. The fact that he's the primary earner isn't a bad thing, but if it's causing conflict or undermining her aspirations, that's an issue. The husband's reasoning seems to prioritize his own feelings over her potential growth and happiness. \n\nAlso, the wife already made a choice to put her education on hold to support them, which he's now taking into account. But she's reigniting her interest now. The husband's reluctance might make her feel unsupported. In a partnership, both should support each other's goals unless there's a compelling reason. Here, the reason is his ego, which isn't a valid reason to withhold support.\n\nSo, even though the husband's feelings are his to have, the action of discouraging his wife's legitimate career path based on his insecurities is wrong. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
