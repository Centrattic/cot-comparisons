I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the wife already works but makes less than half of what the author earns. They don't plan on having kids, so there's no immediate need for dual income. The author feels good about being the sole breadwinner, and he's worried about feeling emasculated if she makes more. He's against her going to grad school, even though her parents are offering to pay for it, and her interest in the program is real.\n\nNow, the key points here are about the author's motivations. He's not opposing her pursuit because of financial burden (since the parents are covering it) but because of his own ego. That's a big red flag. Supporting a partner's ambition is generally seen as important in a healthy relationship. His reasoning is based on his self-esteem tied to being the higher earner, which is a traditional gender role and might be outdated or restrictive.\n\nHowever, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. But in most societal standards, discouraging a spouse from advancing their career because of personal insecurities is seen as problematic. The author is prioritizing his own feelings over his wife's aspirations. Even if the financial situation is stable, the wife's desire to pursue her dream and the parents' support suggest that this is a valid path for her. The author's reaction could be seen as controlling or undermining her autonomy.\n\nSo, the answer is likely A. The author is in the wrong because his reasons for opposing her decision are based on his own insecurities rather than her best interests. A healthy relationship should encourage each other's growth, even if it changes the dynamics of the partnership.\n"
