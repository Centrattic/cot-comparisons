I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband doesn't want his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The wife had put her grad school plans on hold to work full-time when they were dating. Now her parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which could lead to a higher salary. The husband is against it because he feels emasculated if she makes more than him, even though they don't need the money since he's the main earner.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a traditional perspective, some might think it's okay for the husband to feel that way, but modern values emphasize equality in relationships and supporting each other's ambitions regardless of income. The husband is prioritizing his own ego over his wife's aspirations, which could be seen as selfish. Also, the wife has supported him in the past by working to support them both, so it's her right to pursue her goals now. The husband's concern about financial security is moot since they live comfortably on his salary. \n\nHowever, the husband might argue that he's concerned about their stability if she changes careers. But the wife says she's willing to leave a job she loves, which is a big red flag. The husband's primary issue is his own insecurities, which might not be his fault but still wrong. \n\nMost people would likely say the husband is in the wrong because he's not supporting his wife's dreams due to his own pride. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
