I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a guy in his late 20s who's married. His wife makes less than half his salary. They don't plan to have kids, so there's no financial need for her to increase her earnings. When the author was in grad school, his wife (then girlfriend) put her grad plans on hold to work full-time and support them. Now, her parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead her to earn more than him. The author is uncomfortable with her pursuing this because he likes being the sole breadwinner and feels emasculated if he made less. He's asking if he's the asshole (AITA) for not wanting her to go for this opportunity.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points here. The author's main issue is his ego\u2014feeling that his self-worth is tied to being the higher earner. His wife has already made a significant sacrifice by putting her education on hold to support the relationship when he was in school. Now, her parents are offering to cover the costs, so there's no financial burden on her. She's interested in a different career path that she's passionate about, even though she loves her current job. The author's objection isn't about financial implications but his own feelings about being the breadwinner.\n\nI think the main ethical points here are about supporting a partner's aspirations and the importance of self-worth not being tied to income. The wife has a clear opportunity to pursue her goals without financial stress, which is something she's excited about. The author's reluctance is based on personal insecurity rather than practical concerns. In a healthy relationship, partners should encourage each other's growth. If the author's self-esteem is so tied to being the higher earner, that could be a red flag. However, the fact that they don't need more money might mean the financial aspect isn't a problem. But the emotional aspect\u2014his discomfort with her success\u2014could be problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't outright blocking her; he's just expressing concerns. He mentioned he's not happy but backed off. Still, his underlying reason is about feeling emasculated, which is a personal issue. The wife's parents are offering the funding, so there's no pressure to take it, but it's an option she's excited about. If the author can't support her in pursuing her dreams for fear of his ego being hurt, that's a problem. It might suggest that his feelings are more about himself than her well-being.\n\nI should also consider if there's any other angle. The wife's decision to go back to grad school would lead her to a different career path. The author is worried about the dynamic changing, but maybe they can adjust. The fact that they don't plan to have kids removes the traditional need for him to be the sole breadwinner. His discomfort seems to stem from traditional gender roles and ego. In modern relationships, shared financial responsibility is common, so his insistence on being the breadwinner might be outdated. The wife's choice to pursue her goals should be respected, and the author's insecurity might need addressing, but he's not necessarily in the wrong if he's honest about his feelings and they're willing to work through it. However, if he's preventing her from making a choice that's right for her just because of his ego, that's a problem.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key here is whether his feelings are valid or if they're an obstacle to his wife's aspirations. If he's not actively stopping her but is just personally conflicted, maybe it's more of a personal issue. But if his stance is based on harmful beliefs about gender roles or if he's discouraging her in a way that's not supportive, then he could be in the wrong. The answer depends on whether his reaction is reasonable. Since the wife's opportunity is viable and she's excited, the author's reluctance based on ego seems to be the issue. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not supporting her decision.\n"
