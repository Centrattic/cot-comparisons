I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the husband doesn't want his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. They don't have kids, and he's the main breadwinner. He feels it's about his ego and doesn't want to feel emasculated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The wife is offered a chance to go to grad school with her parents' support, which would lead to a higher salary. She's already in a job she loves but is considering a different path. The husband's main objection is about being the breadwinner and his feelings of emasculation.\n\nNow, thinking about societal norms and what's considered right. In many modern relationships, supporting a partner's career growth is seen as important. The husband's reason is based on his self-esteem rather than practical needs since they can live comfortably on his income. His focus on being the breadwinner could be seen as traditional gender roles, which some might view as outdated or problematic.\n\nThe wife made sacrifices before by putting her grad school plans on hold to support him. Now she's considering her own aspirations. The husband's opposition here might be seen as hindering her personal and professional growth. Even if their financial situation is stable, her career goals are her own to pursue.\n\nHowever, the husband is being honest about his feelings. He's not forcing her to do anything; he's expressing his concerns. But the core issue is whether his feelings about his role as the breadwinner justify opposing her career move. Since the problem is his insecurity rather than any financial necessity, it's more about his personal issues than the practicality of their situation.\n\nAlso, the wife's parents are offering financial support, which reduces the financial burden on the couple. The husband's argument isn't about the cost but his own ego. It's important to recognize that each person's career choices should be respected unless there's a genuine negative impact. Here, the impact is emotional on the husband, but that doesn't necessarily override her right to pursue her goals.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband isn't wrong in feeling how he does, but acting on those feelings to prevent his wife from advancing her career could be seen as the wrong choice. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to support his wife's decision. Since the AITA (Am I the Asshole) context is about whether his actions are unreasonable, the answer would likely be yes because his reasoning is based on ego rather than valid concerns for their relationship or well-being.\n"
