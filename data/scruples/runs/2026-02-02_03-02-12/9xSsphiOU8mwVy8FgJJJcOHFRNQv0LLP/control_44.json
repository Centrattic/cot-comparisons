I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation involves the husband not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him.\n\nFirst, the husband's reasoning is that he likes being the breadwinner and feels emasculated if he makes less. He also mentions they live comfortably on his income and don't need more money. The wife, on the other hand, is getting a chance for free grad school from her wealthy parents and wants to switch to a higher-paying career, even though she loves her current job.\n\nNow, the key points here are about personal values and how they affect relationships. The husband's feelings about being the financial provider are his personal insecurities. But is that a valid reason to discourage someone's career growth? The wife made a sacrifice before by putting her grad school plans on hold to support him during his studies. Now she's being given an opportunity, and he's not supportive because of his ego.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, supporting a partner's ambitions is usually seen as important in a healthy relationship. The husband's objection seems to stem from his own self-esteem rather than the wife's best interests. Even though their financial situation is stable, the wife has a chance for personal growth and career advancement. The husband's fear of feeling emasculated is a personal issue, but it shouldn't override his wife's desires unless there's a significant reason like financial necessity, which isn't the case here.\n\nHowever, the husband did express his concerns about her career change possibly leading to a different path than her current job. But the wife has already decided she wants to pursue her dream despite loving her current job, which might be a red flag about compatibility in their career goals.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband's stance is based on his own feelings rather than objective reasons. The wife's parents are offering to pay, so there's no financial burden on the couple. The husband's main issue is about status and ego, which should be addressed through self-reflection rather than hindering his wife's opportunities.\n\nSo, the answer here is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because his resistance is based on personal insecurities rather than valid concerns about their financial or emotional well-being. Supporting a partner's ambitions is generally considered the right approach unless there's a compelling reason not to, which isn't presented here.\n"
