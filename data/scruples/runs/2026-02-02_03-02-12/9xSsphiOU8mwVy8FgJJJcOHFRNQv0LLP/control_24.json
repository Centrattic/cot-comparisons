I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The story is about a husband who doesn't want his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. He's concerned about being the breadwinner and feeling emasculated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is offered a chance to go to grad school, supported by her parents, which could lead to a higher salary. The husband's main issue is about his self-esteem being tied to being the higher earner. They don't have kids and live comfortably on his salary alone. The wife is excited about her dream, even though she loves her current job.\n\nSo, the key points are: the husband's feelings of emasculation vs. the wife's career aspirations. The husband's reasoning seems to be based on personal insecurities rather than practical needs. The wife is making a choice that's important to her, and the husband is discouraging her because of his own ego.\n\nSocietally, it's generally encouraged to support a partner's career growth, especially if it's their dream. The husband's stance might be seen as traditional or even discriminatory, as it's not about the couple's needs but his own pride. Since they can afford for her to pursue this and the wife is motivated, the husband's opposition might be inconsiderate of her desires.\n\nBut I should also check if there are other factors. The husband mentions that he supported her decision to put grad school on hold earlier. Now she's changing her mind, and he's not happy. The husband's argument that he's the one providing financially isn't a strong reason to block her from advancing, especially since they don't need the extra income. His feelings of emasculation are personal but shouldn't override her ambitions.\n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's goals is crucial. The husband's response might be seen as selfish. If the wife wants to pursue this path, it's her right, and the husband should support her unless there are valid financial concerns. Here, the financial situation isn't an issue, so his opposition is based on his own ego, which makes him in the wrong.\n"
