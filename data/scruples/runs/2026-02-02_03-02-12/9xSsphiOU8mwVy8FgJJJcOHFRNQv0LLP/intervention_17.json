I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. The situation is that he's the main breadwinner, they live comfortably, and the wife is considering grad school with her parents' support, which would lead to a higher salary. The author feels emasculated at the thought of making less than her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband acknowledges that his reasoning is partly about ego\u2014feeling good being the breadwinner. That's a personal feeling, but is it valid? From a modern perspective, traditional gender roles are being challenged, so prioritizing one's own ego over a partner's career goals might be seen as problematic. However, the husband isn't stopping her from pursuing it; he's just sharing his concerns. He even said he backed off after talking, so it's not like he's actively preventing her.\n\nThe wife's autonomy is important. She has a chance to pursue her dream with financial support from her parents. The husband's financial situation is secure, so there's no real need for him to be the sole provider. His feelings of emasculation might stem from societal pressures rather than personal values. But he's being honest about his feelings, which is a key point. However, in a healthy relationship, supporting each other's ambitions is crucial. If he's not supportive, it could affect their partnership negatively.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but others might argue that prioritizing one's ego over a spouse's aspirations is wrong. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer depends on whether the husband is respecting his wife's choices despite his feelings. Since he's not outright blocking her and is expressing his concerns, maybe he's not entirely in the wrong. But the fact that his main reason is about being the breadwinner might still be considered wrong by some standards.\n"
