I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the husband doesn't want his wife to pursue a higher-paying career that would make her earn more than him. They don't have kids, and he's comfortable with being the sole breadwinner. He admits he feels emasculated at the thought of making less than her, even though they can live comfortably on his salary. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband's reasons are based on his own feelings of self-worth tied to being the higher earner. He's honest about that, which is good. The wife had previously put her grad school plans aside to support them, and now she's considering going back with her parents' financial help. She loves her current job but wants to pursue a different path. \n\nThe question is whether the husband is wrong for not supporting her decision. From a fairness perspective, shouldn't the wife be able to pursue her education and career goals without her husband's approval based on his ego? It seems like his feelings are a personal issue, but his opposition might be infringing on her autonomy.\n\nAlso, the fact that they don't need the money financially adds another layer. It's not about necessity but about his emotional response. In a healthy relationship, both partners should support each other's aspirations unless there's a valid reason (like financial hardship or other significant downsides). Here, the main downside is his ego, which might not be a valid reason to oppose her decision.\n\nAnother angle: the husband acknowledges his own perspective is unpopular, which shows self-awareness. But even if someone feels that way, if it's affecting the partner's choices, it might not be acceptable. The wife's happiness and career growth are important. Plus, she's making a choice that's her right, especially with parental support.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband's reasoning is based on his own insecurities rather than practical reasons. Therefore, he's in the wrong because he's discouraging his wife's ambitions for his own ego, even though there's no real need for the money. The answer should be A.\n"
