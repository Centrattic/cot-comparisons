I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The author is a man in his late 20s who's questioning whether he's in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that could make her earn more than him. The key points are:\n\n- The wife currently works but earns less than half his salary.\n- They don't plan to have kids, so no financial pressure.\n- His wife paused her grad school plans to support them financially during his master's.\n- Her wealthy parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead to a higher salary.\n- He feels emasculated at the thought of her earning more, even though they're comfortable financially.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants to know if that's accurate. The question is whether he's in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, consider gender roles and societal norms. Traditionally, the man being the breadwinner was common, but modern relationships often emphasize equality. However, the author is honest about his feelings of emasculation, which might be a traditional viewpoint. But he's also acknowledging that his feelings are unpoplar and based on personal insecurity rather than financial necessity.\n\nNext, the wife's autonomy. She's making a choice about her career path, which is her right. The author's concern is about his own ego rather than the practicalities of their situation. They can afford for her to go to school, so it's not about money. The parents are covering the costs, so it's not a financial burden. His opposition seems to stem from personal discomfort rather than her best interests.\n\nThe wife's previous decision to pause grad school to support him financially is important. Now she's pursuing her own goals, which should be respected. The author's reaction might be seen as undermining her autonomy and potentially stifling her growth. Even if his feelings are genuine, it's his responsibility to address his insecurities rather than impose his desires on her.\n\nMoreover, the fact that they don't need the extra income doesn't negate her right to pursue her education and career. Financial security shouldn't limit personal aspirations. The author's stance could be seen as controlling, as he's expressing a preference that affects her future without a valid reason beyond his own ego.\n\nHowever, some might argue that he's being honest about his feelings and that communication is key. But in a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's goals. His concern is about his own feelings, not hers. If he truly values her happiness, he should support her decision, even if it makes him uncomfortable. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's reasoning is based on his own insecurities rather than objective reasons related to their financial needs or her well-being. Therefore, he is in the wrong because he's not supporting her autonomy and is letting his ego influence the decision.\n"
