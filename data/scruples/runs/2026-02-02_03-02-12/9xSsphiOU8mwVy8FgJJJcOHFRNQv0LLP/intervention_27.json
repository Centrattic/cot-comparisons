I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the husband) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him.\n\nFirst, the husband's reasoning is that he's comfortable being the sole breadwinner and feels emasculated if he makes less. He mentions that they live comfortably on his salary alone and don't plan to have kids. The wife is considering grad school again, which her parents are funding, and this would lead her to a higher-paying job.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The wife chose to put her education on hold to support him during his master's, and now she's reconsidering. The husband's main issue is about his self-esteem tied to being the breadwinner. That's a common issue, but it's a personal feeling. However, in a healthy relationship, supporting each other's aspirations is key. The husband is prioritizing his own ego over his wife's potential growth.\n\nThe wife's parents are offering financial support, reducing the burden on the couple. The husband's financial situation is stable, so the practical need for her to make more isn't there. But the key point is whether his feelings of emasculation are valid in this context. Society is moving towards more equality, and valuing a partner's career growth over one's own ego is important.\n\nThe husband's argument that he would feel \"emasculated\" seems to stem from traditional gender roles. Modern relationships often emphasize mutual support and shared responsibilities. By not wanting his wife to pursue her goals because of his self-esteem, he's not supporting her autonomy. Even though he's providing for them, his wife's happiness and professional development are important considerations.\n\nSo, while his feelings are real, acting on them to hinder his wife's opportunities might be in the wrong. The answer might be A (he is in the wrong) because he's letting his ego affect his spouse's decisions. However, some might argue that it's not his fault for feeling that way. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the validity of his feelings. Supporting a partner's ambitions is a key part of a healthy relationship, so his reluctance here could be seen as a mistake.\n"
