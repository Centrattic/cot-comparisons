I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (who is a man) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both sides. The man's wife has been working and they live comfortably on his salary. She's been putting grad school on hold, but now her wealthy parents are offering to pay for it. He's uncomfortable with her moving into a higher-paying field because he feels it would make him feel emasculated. \n\nSo, the key points here are about gender roles, self-worth tied to income, and communication in the relationship. The man's reasoning is that he likes being the breadwinner, which makes him feel good. However, that's a traditional view that might be problematic. In modern relationships, equality is often emphasized, so his feelings might be seen as outdated or harmful.\n\nBut then, the woman has her own aspirations. She's excited about this new path, even though it's different from her current job. Her parents' wealth removes financial barriers, which is a big factor. The man's opposition is based on his own insecurities rather than her needs or desires. \n\nIs it wrong to feel emasculated? Maybe not, but acting on those feelings to restrict her opportunities definitely is. The fact that they don't need money for kids or other expenses means her career choice is purely about her growth. The man's stance might be inconsiderate of her dreams and could lead to resentment.\n\nAlso, the wife had already put grad school on hold to support him when he was in school. Now she's pursuing her own goals, which is fair. The man's reluctance isn't about practical concerns (like financial strain) but about his ego. That's a red flag in a relationship because it's about his needs over hers.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong (A). His feelings are personal, but they shouldn't override her autonomy and aspirations. The relationship should support each other's growth, not stifle it due to traditional gender roles.\n"
