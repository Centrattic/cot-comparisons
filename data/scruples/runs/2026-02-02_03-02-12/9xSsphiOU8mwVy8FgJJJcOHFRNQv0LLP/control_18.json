I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the husband (the one asking) doesn't want his wife to go to grad school because she might end up making more than him. He feels it's about his ego and being the breadwinner, even though they don't need the extra money.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The wife already put her education on hold to support him when he was in school. Now, her parents are offering to pay for her grad school. She wants to pursue a different career that could pay more. The husband's main issue is his own feeling of being emasculated if she makes more. \n\nThe question is whether his reasons are valid. In modern relationships, financial roles can vary, and it's common for partners to have different incomes. The husband's reasoning is based on ego rather than practical needs, which might be a problem. Also, the wife's decision to further her education is her right, especially since her parents are covering the costs. \n\nHe also mentions that they don't need the money, so it's not about financial necessity but about his personal feelings. This could be seen as controlling or not respecting her aspirations. The wife's career choice is her personal dream, and the husband is trying to influence it for his own reasons, which might not be fair. \n\nAnother angle is that the husband is okay with the wife working but at a lower salary. Now, if she moves up, he feels threatened. That could indicate a lack of support for her growth. In healthy relationships, both partners should support each other's goals regardless of financial implications.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband's reasoning is based on his own insecurities rather than objective reasons. He's not considering his wife's aspirations and is prioritizing his ego over her potential. Therefore, he is likely in the wrong.\n"
