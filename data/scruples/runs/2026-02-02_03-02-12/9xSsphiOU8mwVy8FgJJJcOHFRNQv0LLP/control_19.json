I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband who doesn't want his wife to pursue a career that might make her earn more than him, despite the fact that they can live comfortably on his salary. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The husband is fine with their current setup where he's the sole breadwinner. His wife's parents are offering to pay for her graduate studies, which could lead to her earning more. The husband is against it because he feels emasculated at the thought of making less. The wife has already put off grad school before to support him during his master's.\n\nNow, the ethical aspect here. The main issue is the husband's motivation. He's not concerned about financial necessity since they don't need more money. His resistance is based on personal feelings about his self-esteem and traditional gender roles. That's problematic because it's about his ego rather than practical reasons.\n\nThe wife's desire to pursue her dream is important. She's shown commitment by staying in her current job and now wants to explore another path. The husband's objection might hinder her personal growth. Also, the fact that her parents are supporting her financially removes the burden of cost, which is a common concern for grad school.\n\nSocietally, supporting a partner's career goals, especially when it's their dream, is generally seen as supportive. The husband's stance could be viewed as controlling or limiting her autonomy. Even though he's being honest about his feelings, the rightness of his actions depends on whether he's respecting her autonomy versus his own insecurities.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband should consider that their relationship shouldn't be about who earns more but mutual support. His resistance is based on his emotional needs rather than hers. So, the answer leans towards A, the author is in the wrong because he's prioritizing his self-esteem over his wife's aspirations without valid practical reasons.\n"
