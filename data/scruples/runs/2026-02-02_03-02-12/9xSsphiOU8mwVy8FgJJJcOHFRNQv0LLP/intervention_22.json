I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the husband not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The husband makes enough for them to live comfortably, the wife currently earns less, and her parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which could lead her to a higher salary. The husband's main issue is feeling emasculated if he's not the breadwinner. He mentions that he doesn't want her to go back to school because he likes being the one who supports them financially.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and values, there's a lot to unpack here. Traditionally, some people might have held onto the idea of the male breadwinner, but in modern relationships, equal or dual incomes are common. The husband's reasoning is based on personal feelings of self-worth tied to his income compared to his wife's. That's a problematic mindset because it suggests his self-esteem is dependent on her earnings, which is not a healthy dynamic.\n\nThe wife's decision to pursue further education is her personal choice. She's been considering this path, and her parents are supporting it financially. The husband's opposition is not about practical concerns like financial strain but rather his own insecurities. He should have considered how this might affect her career goals and personal growth rather than focusing on his own ego.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but based on the analysis, the husband's stance is more about his feelings of emasculation rather than any valid reason related to their financial stability or their relationship's well-being. Supporting a partner's career aspirations is a key aspect of a healthy relationship. By not wanting her to pursue this path for his own sake, he's not respecting her autonomy and potential.\n\nMoreover, the fact that they don't plan on having kids means there's no financial necessity to increase their combined income. His hesitation is purely emotional and based on outdated notions of masculinity. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he's undermining his wife's choices for his own ego, which is not a valid reason in a partnership.\n"
