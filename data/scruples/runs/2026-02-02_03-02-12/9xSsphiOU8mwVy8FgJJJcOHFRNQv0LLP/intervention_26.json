I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the husband is questioning his wife's decision to go back to grad school, which could make her earn more than him. They don't have kids, and he's the main breadwinner. He admits he's feeling emasculated if she makes more than him, which he knows is an unpopular opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The wife is considering a career change that she's passionate about, supported by her wealthy parents. The husband's opposition isn't about financial necessity (since they live comfortably) but about his own ego. That seems like a personal issue rather than a valid concern for their relationship or her well-being.\n\nThe question is whether he's wrong for not supporting her decision. In terms of equality and personal growth, it's generally encouraged for individuals to pursue their dreams regardless of income. The husband's stance is based on traditional gender roles where the man is the primary earner. However, modern relationships often prioritize mutual support and individual aspirations over such roles. His reluctance might stem from insecurity rather than rational reasons.\n\nThe wife had already put her education on hold to support him during his master's. Now, she's getting an opportunity to advance her career. The husband's main argument is his own feelings of emasculation, which isn't a justification for opposing her goals. Healthy relationships should encourage each other's growth, even if it changes the dynamic of who earns more. The fact that they can afford her education and she's excited about the path suggests it's a positive move for her, regardless of his feelings.\n\nSo, the husband's reasoning is flawed. It's about his self-esteem rather than practical reasons. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong for not supporting her decision based on personal ego rather than her happiness and career aspirations.\n"
