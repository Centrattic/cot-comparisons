I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a man in his late 20s married to a woman who works but earns less than half of his salary. They don't plan on having kids, so there's no financial need for her to increase her earnings. The wife had put her grad school plans on hold to work full-time, supporting them. Now her wealthy parents are offering to cover her tuition for a graduate program that would lead to a higher salary than his. The author is against her pursuing this because he feels emasculated if she makes more, even though financially they're comfortable.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong, but they're seeking validation. The key points here are about personal values, gender roles, and financial dynamics. \n\nThe author's main issue is feeling emasculated by the idea of being the lower earner. This seems to stem from societal expectations rather than practical needs. The couple has financial stability, so the main conflict is emotional. The question is whether the author is wrong to prioritize his feelings over his wife's aspirations.\n\nIn modern relationships, supporting each other's career goals is often emphasized. The author's reluctance is based on his own insecurities rather than the couple's actual needs. Even though his reasoning is personal, it's important to consider mutual respect and support. If he's hindering her growth because of his ego, that could be a problem. However, he's not actively preventing her from going; he's just expressing his concerns. The wife is making her own decision, so he's not forcing her either way.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author's feelings are causing tension or affecting their relationship negatively, that's a red flag. But he mentions backing off after discussing it, indicating he respects her choice to some extent. The core issue is whether his feelings of emasculation are valid in this context.\n\nIn many perspectives, being the higher earner isn't a necessity, especially when the couple's needs are met. The wife's desire to pursue her dream, even if it changes their financial roles, should be a priority. However, the author's feelings are real, but they shouldn't override her aspirations. The problem is more about his emotional response rather than a malicious intent to block her.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit nuanced. While his reasoning is personal, in a healthy relationship, supporting each other's goals is key. His reluctance is based on ego, which might not be a valid reason to discourage her. Therefore, he could be seen as being in the wrong because his feelings shouldn't take precedence over her aspirations.\n"
