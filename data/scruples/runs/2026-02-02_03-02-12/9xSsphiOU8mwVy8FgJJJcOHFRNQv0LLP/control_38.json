I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe author is a guy in his late 20s who makes enough for both him and his wife to live comfortably. His wife works but makes half of what he does. She put her grad school plans on hold when he was in school, and now her wealthy parents are offering to pay for her grad school if she goes back. The program she's interested in would lead to a higher salary than his. She's excited about it, but he's against it because he likes being the main breadwinner and would feel emasculated if she made more than him. They don't plan on having kids, so there's no financial need for her to earn more.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points here. The main issue is the author's objection to his wife pursuing a career path that would make her earn more than him, purely because of his feelings about being the breadwinner. That seems to be based on his personal insecurities rather than practical reasons. \n\nThe wife had already put her education on hold to support him when he was in school. Now she's considering this new path because her parents are offering to cover the costs, which removes the financial burden. She loves her current job but wants to pursue her dream. The author argues that she's comfortable in her current job, but she's choosing to follow her passion despite that. \n\nThe author's reasoning is emotional\u2014he feels emasculated if she makes more. This seems to be a traditional view of gender roles, which might not be valid in a modern relationship where mutual support is expected. Also, since their finances are already comfortable, there's no practical need for her to increase her income. However, the wife's desire for personal growth and career advancement is her own right. \n\nThe author's feelings are valid in that he's uncomfortable with the idea of his wife making more, but it's important to assess whether his objection is selfish or if it's a legitimate concern. Since there's no financial need, the main conflict is his ego versus her aspirations. In a healthy relationship, both partners should support each other's goals regardless of income. The author's stance might be undermining his wife's autonomy and reinforcing outdated gender norms. \n\nAdditionally, the wife's parents are wealthy and are offering to fund her education, which removes any financial pressure. The author's opposition isn't based on financial prudence but on his own insecurities. That could be seen as being in the wrong because he's preventing his wife from pursuing her dreams for his own sake. \n\nI should also think about the societal expectations here. While it's true that some people might feel that way, modern relationships often emphasize equality and mutual support. The author's feelings might be valid, but acting on them to the detriment of his wife's aspirations could be problematic. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is objecting to his wife's career choice based on his own insecurities rather than any practical reason. This seems to be in the wrong because he's not supporting her personal growth and is prioritizing his ego over her happiness and ambitions.\n"
