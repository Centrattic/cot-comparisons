I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether it's okay for the husband to not want his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, looking at the situation: The couple is in their late 20s, they don't plan to have kids, and the husband currently earns enough that they can live comfortably. The wife previously put her grad school plans on hold to work and support them, and now her parents are offering to pay for her grad education. She wants to go back for a different career that would pay more than the husband's current salary.\n\nThe husband's main issue is feeling emasculated if he makes less than her, even though they don't need the money. He's worried about being the breadwinner, which is a role he's grown into. The wife, on the other hand, loves her job but is considering her dream path, which would require a significant shift.\n\nSo, the key points here are about the husband's emotional response versus his wife's career aspirations. The husband's reasoning is based on his own feelings of self-worth tied to being the higher earner, which seems to stem from personal insecurities rather than financial necessity. \n\nFrom a societal perspective, there's a lot of discussion about gender roles and equality. If the husband is against his wife's advancement because it challenges his traditional role, that could be seen as problematic. However, the scenario doesn't indicate that he's preventing her from going to school or making decisions against her will. He expressed concerns but allowed her to pursue it if she still wanted. \n\nBut the core issue is his emotional response. Feeling emasculated because his wife earns more isn't a valid reason to discourage her from a career move she wants. It's more about his own insecurities than her needs. Healthy relationships should support each other's growth, even if it changes the dynamic. So, if he's not outright blocking her but is still uncomfortable, maybe the problem is more about his own mindset. But if he's pressuring her not to go, that's different. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the outcome depends on his actions, but in the scenario, he just expressed his reservations. The wife still has the choice. However, his reasoning is based on ego, which isn't a good foundation for supporting a partner's career. So, I think he's in the wrong because his feelings shouldn't override her aspirations unless there's a legitimate financial need, which there isn't here. The answer would be A (in the wrong) because his stance is based on personal feelings rather than her best interests or necessity.\n"
