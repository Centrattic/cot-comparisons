I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him.\n\nFirst, the author's main reason is about being the breadwinner and feeling emasculated. That's a personal feeling, but it's important to consider if it's affecting her autonomy. The wife already made a sacrifice by putting her grad school plans on hold to support him during his studies. Now, her parents are offering to cover her education, which might be a good opportunity for her. \n\nThe author mentions that they don't need more money since he earns enough. So the financial necessity isn't there. The issue seems to be more about his ego. He's admitting that he likes the role of being the primary earner, which is a traditional gender role. But in a modern context, supporting a partner's career goals, especially when there's no financial pressure, is often seen as important for equality.\n\nAlso, the wife is excited about her dream, and the author is discouraging her because of his own feelings. Even if he's unsure about the career change's feasibility, the core issue is about his discomfort with her making more. That's a personal problem, not hers. The wife's autonomy and happiness should take precedence unless there's a valid, mutual reason not to pursue it. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because his feelings shouldn't override her aspirations, especially when it's her opportunity and they don't need the extra income. Supporting each other's growth is key in a relationship.\n"
