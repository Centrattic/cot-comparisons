I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA question is wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author makes enough to support both of them, and his wife currently earns less. She's been working and not going to grad school, but now her parents are offering to pay for it, which would lead her to a different career path with higher pay. The author is concerned about feeling emasculated if she makes more.\n\nHmm, the key points here are his reasons. He's not opposing her for financial necessity but because he feels it would affect his self-worth. That seems to be the main issue. The wife is interested in her dream, which he acknowledges she loves. But he's holding her back because of his own ego.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, society generally encourages people to pursue their goals, especially when there's no financial pressure. The fact that her parents are covering the costs removes the financial burden for her, so it's more about personal aspirations. The husband's opposition is based on his insecurity rather than practical concerns. That makes me think he's in the wrong because he's prioritizing his own feelings over her aspirations.\n\nAlso, the wife sacrificed her grad school plans before to support him when he was in school. Now she's considering her own path, and he's not supportive. It's about mutual respect and supporting each other's dreams. If he can't support her because of his ego, that's a problem in the relationship. So, I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
