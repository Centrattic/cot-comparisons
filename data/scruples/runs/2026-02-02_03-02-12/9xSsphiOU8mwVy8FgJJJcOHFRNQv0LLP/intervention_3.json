I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the husband) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that could make her earn more than him.\n\nFirst, the husband says he makes enough for both of them to live comfortably. They don't have kids, so there's no financial pressure. His wife had put grad school on hold earlier to work full-time, and he thought she was settled. Now, her parents are offering to pay for her education, which would lead her to a higher salary than his current one. He's feeling emasculated if she makes more, which he admits is an unpopular opinion.\n\nThe key points here are about his feelings of being the breadwinner and his potential emasculation. From a traditional perspective, some people might feel that the man should be the primary earner, but modern relationships often emphasize equality and support for each other's goals. The husband's main issue isn't about supporting his wife's career but about his personal feelings of self-worth tied to income. \n\nHe's not opposing her career for her sake or practical reasons; he's more concerned about his own ego. That could be problematic because it's about his insecurities rather than her aspirations. However, he is being honest about his feelings, even if they're based on outdated notions. The wife seems to want to pursue her dream, which should be her choice unless there are valid reasons against it.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is rooted in personal feelings rather than objective factors like financial necessity. In terms of fairness, he's not in the wrong for having those feelings, but he might be in the wrong for potentially stifling his wife's ambitions based on his own insecurities. The question is whether his feelings are valid or if the wife's aspirations should take precedence.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, many would argue that supporting a partner's career is important regardless of income. However, if both agree and it's a mutual decision, it's different. Here, the husband is expressing his discomfort, but the wife is eager. The husband's stance could be seen as traditional and possibly selfish, but not necessarily wrong in terms of his personal feelings.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether his feelings make him in the wrong. If being in the wrong is about not supporting her despite his own feelings, then maybe he is. But if being in the wrong is about having those feelings, perhaps not. However, in terms of actions, he's not forcing her, just expressing his opinion. The main issue is his reasoning, which is based on his ego. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for prioritizing his feelings over his wife's career aspirations.\n"
