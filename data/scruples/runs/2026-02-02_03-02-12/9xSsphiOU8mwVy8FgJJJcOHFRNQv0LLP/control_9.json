I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether it's okay for him to not want his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him.\n\nFirst, the situation: The wife has a job she loves, but the husband is the primary breadwinner. Her parents offered to pay for her grad school, which could lead her to a higher salary. She wants to go back, but the husband is against it. He admits he doesn't like the idea of her making more than him because it would make him feel emasculated. They have no kids, so there's no financial need.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about personal choice, equality in the relationship, and the husband's personal feelings. The wife is making her own decision about her career, which is a big part of her autonomy. The husband's main concern is his ego, not financial necessity. That seems problematic because a healthy relationship should support each other's growth, even if it changes the dynamics.\n\nAlso, the husband's reasoning is based on feeling emasculated, which is a traditional view of gender roles. In a modern, equal partnership, both partners' careers should be valued equally. The husband's opposition isn't about her happiness or the family's needs but about his own pride. That could undermine the wife's autonomy and her right to pursue her goals.\n\nMoreover, the wife already made sacrifices before when she put her grad school plans on hold. Now she's excited about a new opportunity. The husband's reluctance to support her could be seen as holding her back because of his own insecurities. Even though he says he backed off, it's clear he's not fully supportive, which might affect her confidence in pursuing her dream.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because he's prioritizing his own ego over his partner's aspirations and autonomy. The answer should be A.\n"
