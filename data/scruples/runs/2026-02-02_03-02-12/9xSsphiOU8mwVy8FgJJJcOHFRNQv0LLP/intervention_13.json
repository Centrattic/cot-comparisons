I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The husband is the primary breadwinner, and they live comfortably on his salary. The wife has a job she loves but makes less. She's now considering graduate school, partly because her wealthy parents offered to cover the costs. The husband's main objection is that he feels emasculated if she makes more than him. He's worried about his self-esteem and societal expectations.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. But I should evaluate this based on fairness and mutual respect in the relationship. The husband is making a personal admission about his feelings of emasculation, which is a valid emotion for him. However, the wife's desire to pursue her own career path is also important. The husband's decision to voice his concerns might be seen as valid if he's being honest about his feelings. However, the key issue is whether his objection is selfish or if he's respecting her autonomy.\n\nThe wife's parents' motivation (embarrassment) and her own interest in a different career path are factors. The husband's stance could hinder her personal growth and career aspirations. Even if he's being honest, is it right to prioritize his ego over her professional goals? Also, the husband's argument that they don't need more money doesn't negate her desire for personal fulfillment.\n\nIn relationships, it's important that both partners support each other's goals. The husband is not wrong for having feelings, but he might be in the wrong if he's not considering his wife's aspirations. The answer hinges on whether his objection is a reasonable concern or a selfish one. Since the wife's parents are covering the costs, maybe financial concerns aren't the issue. The husband's main issue is his self-worth tied to being the primary earner, which might be an outdated or harmful perspective. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he's letting his ego affect his wife's decisions.\n"
