I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's wife wants to go back to grad school, which could make her earn more than him. The author is uncomfortable with that because he likes being the main breadwinner and feels emasculated if he's not. The wife's parents are offering to pay for her education, and she's excited about pursuing her dream despite loving her current job.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning is based on feeling emasculated if his wife earns more. That's a classic case of traditional gender roles where the man's ego is tied to being the higher earner. But in modern relationships, financial roles are more flexible. The fact that they don't plan to have kids and already live comfortably means the financial necessity isn't there. The wife is following her own interests, which is important for personal fulfillment. \n\nThe author's main argument is about his feelings of masculinity. However, that's his personal issue, not hers. He should consider whether his feelings are valid or if they're based on outdated societal expectations. Also, the wife made a sacrifice earlier by putting her grad school on hold to support the author during his studies. Now she's being given an opportunity by her parents, and it's her choice to take it. \n\nBut is the author wrong for feeling this way? Well, the problem isn't in feeling uncomfortable, but in trying to control his wife's career choices based on his ego. The wife has her own aspirations and the support from her parents. The author should respect her decision even if it makes him feel insecure. His reasoning is self-centered, which can be seen as inconsiderate of her desires and personal growth. \n\nHowever, the author is honest about his feelings and hasn't outright forbidden her from going. He's expressed his concerns, and she's aware of his stance. The key issue is whether he's trying to hinder her pursuit. If he's supportive and they can work through the emotional aspects together, it might not be a problem. But if he's actively discouraging her or making her feel guilty, then that's where he's in the wrong. The scenario suggests he's not stopping her but is conflicted. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should support each other's goals. The author's feelings are valid, but his perspective is rooted in traditional gender roles. The wife's decision to pursue her passion is her right. So, the author's stance might not be in the wrong in terms of expressing his feelings, but in terms of prioritizing his ego over her aspirations and growth. Therefore, the answer leans towards him being in the wrong because his reasoning is based on his insecurities rather than her needs.\n"
