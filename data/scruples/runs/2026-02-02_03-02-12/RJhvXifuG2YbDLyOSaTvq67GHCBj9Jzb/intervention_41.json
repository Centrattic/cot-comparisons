I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author replied to his sister's birthday message while they were out to eat with his girlfriend. The girlfriend doesn't like when he uses his phone during meals, so after he replied, she became upset and didn't talk to him the rest of the night. Plus, he had to pay for dinner, which he wasn't expecting because he thought she would cover it. He also mentions that he used his last savings to pay off a loan, so he's frustrated about having to pay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author did reply to his sister, which upset his girlfriend because of her phone policy. The girlfriend's feelings are important here. Even if the message was a birthday greeting, using the phone during a dinner might be seen as disrespectful. The girlfriend's reaction could be based on prior agreements or her personal boundaries. \n\nThen, the payment issue. The author assumed she would pay, but she didn't. That's a separate issue. Maybe they had a prior understanding, but if not, it's a miscommunication. However, the main question is about the phone use. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. But the girlfriend's feelings might matter more here. If there's a history of the author using his phone during meals, then it's a recurring problem. But if it was a one-time response to a birthday message, maybe the girlfriend overreacted. However, the girlfriend's stance is that she doesn't like phone use during meals, so even a quick reply might breach that boundary.\n\nAlso, the author's frustration about paying is another layer. He mentions financial stress, which adds to his anger. But that's a different issue from the phone use.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's action (replying to the message) might be the trigger for the girlfriend's upset. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether he respected her boundaries. If there's a prior agreement not to use phones during meals, then yes, he's in the wrong. If not, maybe she overreacted. However, given that she clearly stated she doesn't like it when he uses his phone, even if it's a quick reply, he should have been mindful. So, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) for the phone use, but the payment issue is separate. However, the user's question focuses on the phone reply leading to the girlfriend's reaction. The user's own opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to evaluate objectively.\n"
