Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for replying to his sister's birthday message during a dinner with his girlfriend. The girlfriend doesn't like him using his phone when they're out, and she wouldn't talk to him the rest of the night. Also, he had to pay for dinner, thinking she would, and he mentions financial strain from paying off a loan.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the phone use. The girlfriend has expressed that she doesn't like him using his phone during their time together. Even if the message was from his sister, using the phone in that context might be a breach of her boundaries. Relationships often require mutual respect for each other's preferences, so if she's clear about not liking phone use, the author should consider that.\n\nThen there's the financial aspect. He thought she would pay, but she didn't. Maybe there was a misunderstanding, but he didn't mention clarifying that before the dinner. If he was in a tight financial situation, maybe he should have communicated that earlier instead of assuming she'd cover the cost. However, the original question is about the phone use, not the payment. But the fact that he's still upset about the payment might influence his perspective on the situation.\n\nThe sister sent a birthday message, which is a common gesture. However, interrupting a dinner with a partner to respond could be seen as inconsiderate, depending on the partner's feelings. The author's justification is that it was his birthday and from his sister, but if the girlfriend has a rule about phone use during meals, breaking that could be an issue. It's possible the girlfriend felt disrespected or neglected, leading her to withdraw the rest of the night.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but from a relationship standpoint, respecting the partner's boundaries is usually important. So, even if the message was from a family member, the act of using the phone during their time together might be where the author went wrong. The financial part adds to the tension, but the main question is about the phone use. So, considering the girlfriend's expressed preferences, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her boundaries.\n"
