Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author replying to his sister's birthday message during dinner with his girlfriend, which the girlfriend dislikes. The girlfriend then becomes silent for the rest of the night. Additionally, the author ended up paying for dinner, thinking she would cover it, and he's upset about the financial burden after recently emptying his accounts to pay off a loan.\n\nFirst, the main issue is using the phone during dinner. The girlfriend explicitly mentioned she doesn't like it when he uses his phone during outings. By replying to the sister, he violated her boundaries, which led to her not talking to him for the rest of the night. That seems like a significant breach in their established rules. Even though it's a birthday message, there's an expectation when in a relationship, especially when plans are made, to respect the partner's preferences during that time.\n\nThen there's the financial aspect. The author assumed the girlfriend would pay, but she ended up not covering it. He mentions he's in a tight financial spot, which adds to his frustration. However, the key point here is the assumption he made without confirming. If they had discussed payment beforehand, maybe they could have split it or the girlfriend would have covered it. Since he didn't clarify, he might have misread the situation, leading to his own financial stress.\n\nPutting it all together, the author's actions\u2014disregarding his girlfriend's preference about phone use and making an incorrect assumption about payment\u2014are the main points of contention. The girlfriend's reaction is a direct result of these actions. While the author is upset, the core issue lies in his failure to respect her boundaries and communicate clearly about financial expectations. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for both instances.\n"
