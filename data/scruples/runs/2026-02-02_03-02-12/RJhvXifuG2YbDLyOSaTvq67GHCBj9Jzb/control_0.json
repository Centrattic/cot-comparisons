I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves their sister messaging them a birthday wish while they're out to eat with their girlfriend. The key points here are:\n\n1. **The Response to the Sister**: The author replied to their sister's message during dinner. The girlfriend doesn't like when the author uses the phone when they're out. The girlfriend became upset and wouldn't talk for the rest of the night. \n\n2. **Paying for Dinner**: The author assumed their girlfriend would pay, but they ended up paying instead. They had just emptied their savings and checking to pay off a loan, so this was a financial burden they weren't expecting.\n\n3. **Prior Communication**: Before going out, the girlfriend asked if they wanted to go out for a birthday dinner. The author didn't mention the financial situation beforehand, which might be relevant.\n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's perspective: she might feel that using the phone during dinner is disrespectful or inconsiderate, especially if she had previously expressed a dislike for it. The author's response could have been seen as ignoring her preferences, leading to her upset. Additionally, the financial aspect adds stress because the author didn't communicate their financial situation, leading to an unexpected expense.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel they were just acknowledging their sister's message and didn't realize it would cause a conflict. They might also be frustrated about the financial aspect since they thought the girlfriend would cover the cost.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author should have known better than to use their phone during dinner, given their girlfriend's previous concerns. If the girlfriend had clearly communicated that phone use was off-limits during dates, then the author is in the wrong for not respecting that. However, if the communication wasn't clear, it's a bit more ambiguous. The financial part is tricky too; the author didn't mention their financial state, which could have influenced their expectation that the girlfriend would pay. \n\nBut overall, the primary conflict stems from the phone use during dinner. Since the girlfriend had already expressed disapproval of phone use, the author's response to their sister's message was likely inconsiderate and contributed to the argument. The financial misunderstanding is a separate issue but still a point of miscommunication. So, the author might be in the wrong for not heeding the girlfriend's previous request about phone use, leading to the strained evening. However, the financial part is more about communication rather than a clear wrong.\n"
