Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for replying to their sister's birthday message while out to eat with their girlfriend. The girlfriend doesn't like phone use during meals, and she got upset, leading to a silent night. Plus, the author ended up paying for dinner, which was unexpected.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the phone use. The girlfriend had previously expressed disapproval, so using the phone could be seen as a breach of mutual agreement or respect. Even if the message was a surprise, not checking in with the girlfriend beforehand might have been a mistake. The sister's message was a birthday greeting, which is understandable, but the timing and context matter here.\n\nThen there's the payment part. The author assumed the girlfriend would pay, but she didn't. Maybe there was a misunderstanding about who was paying. The author had financial difficulties, so being out of money is a valid concern. However, assuming someone else would pay without clarification could be an oversight. The girlfriend might have felt disrespected if the author didn't follow up on the payment arrangement.\n\nAlso, the sister's message was a birthday wish, which is a special day. The author might feel it's important to acknowledge, but the context of being on a date with a partner who has specific boundaries complicates things. The fact that the girlfriend was upset enough to stay silent suggests that her feelings were hurt or ignored.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for two reasons: using the phone despite prior agreements and assuming payment without confirmation. However, the financial situation adds context that might mitigate some blame. But since the question is about being in the wrong, the phone use and the payment assumption are key points. Therefore, the answer leans towards A (Yes).\n"
