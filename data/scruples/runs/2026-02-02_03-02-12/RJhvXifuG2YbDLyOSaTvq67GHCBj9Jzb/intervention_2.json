I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for replying to their sister's birthday message while on a dinner date with their girlfriend. The situation is that the girlfriend doesn't like when he uses his phone during their time out. After replying, she didn't talk to him the rest of the night. He's upset because he had to pay for dinner, thinking she would cover it, and he just paid off a loan, so his savings are empty.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author's sister sent a birthday message, which he replied to. The girlfriend's rule is no phone use during their time out. He broke that rule by replying, which upset her, leading to her silence for the rest of the night. He's also upset about paying for dinner, thinking she was paying, which adds to his frustration.\n\nNow, the main question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, he didn't inform his girlfriend about the dinner being his birthday, so she might have expected him to handle the payment. Also, he broke her rule by using the phone, which she dislikes. That could be seen as disrespectful, especially since she had communicated her preferences beforehand. On the other hand, replying to a birthday message might seem innocuous, but in the context of a date where the girlfriend has specific boundaries, it's a breach. The fact that he had to pay for dinner might be a separate issue, but the main conflict is about respecting her boundaries. \n\nHe should have considered her feelings about phone use during their time together. Even if the message was from his sister, he could have saved the reply until after the dinner. The misunderstanding about paying for dinner might be a result of not discussing expectations beforehand. So, the primary fault is his actions regarding the phone, which directly led to the girlfriend's upset. Therefore, he is in the wrong here.\n"
