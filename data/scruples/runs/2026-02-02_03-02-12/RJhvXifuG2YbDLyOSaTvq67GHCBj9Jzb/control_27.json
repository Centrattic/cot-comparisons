      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault in the situation described. The key points are:\n\n1. The sister messaged \"Happy Birthday\" when the author and his girlfriend were out to eat. The author replied, which his girlfriend doesn't like because she objects to him using his phone during their outings. After that, she didn't talk to him the rest of the night.\n\n2. The author also had to pay for dinner, thinking she would cover it. He mentions he emptied his savings and checking to pay off a loan, so he was in a tight financial spot.\n\n3. Before going out, the sister asked if he wanted to go out for dinner, implying it was a joint plan, but he didn't realize he'd have to pay.\n\nNow, considering these points: \n\nFirst, the girlfriend's preference is that he shouldn't use his phone when they're out. The sister's message was a birthday wish, which is a common and polite thing to send. The author replying to it might have been seen as dismissive or inconsiderate by the girlfriend, depending on how long he was on the phone. If it was just a quick response, maybe it's not a big deal, but if it was prolonged, that could be the issue. The girlfriend's reaction of staying silent the rest of the night suggests she was hurt or upset, which the author is still resentful about.\n\nSecond, the financial aspect: the author thought the sister would pay, but she didn't. He didn't mention this to her beforehand, which might be a problem. If he assumed she would pay but didn't clarify, that's on him. The sister might have expected him to pay, especially if it was his birthday. Or maybe there was a misunderstanding. Either way, not discussing the payment expectations beforehand led to an awkward situation.\n\nPutting it all together: The author's main mistakes could be not respecting the girlfriend's boundaries about phone use, leading to her upset, and not clarifying who would pay for dinner, resulting in him having to cover it despite his financial situation. However, the sister might not have intended for him to pay, so maybe she's also at fault. But the question is about the author's wrongdoing. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author should have been aware of his girlfriend's dislike for phone use and avoided it, even if it was a birthday message. Also, he should have discussed who would pay before the dinner to avoid the financial stress. Therefore, he might be at fault in both aspects.\n"
