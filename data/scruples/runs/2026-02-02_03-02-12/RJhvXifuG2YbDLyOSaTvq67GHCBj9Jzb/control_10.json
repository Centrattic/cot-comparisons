I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who replied to their sister's birthday message is in the wrong. The situation involves them being out to eat with their girlfriend, and the girlfriend doesn't like phone use. After replying, the girlfriend became upset and didn't talk the rest of the night. Also, the author had to pay for dinner, assuming the GF would cover it, and they're frustrated about the financial situation.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is whether replying to a birthday message is a valid reason for the girlfriend's anger. The girlfriend doesn't like phone use during meals, which suggests she values being present and engaged. Replying to a message, even if brief, might have been seen as disrespectful or a breach of her boundaries. The girlfriend might feel disrespected or ignored, leading to her not talking for the rest of the night.\n\nThen there's the financial aspect. The author thought the GF would pay, but she didn't. This could add to the tension, especially since the author mentions financial strain from paying off a loan. However, the assumption that the GF would pay might not have been communicated clearly. If the GF expected the author to pay, or if there's an unspoken norm in their relationship, the author's assumption could be a point of contention.\n\nThe sister's message was a birthday wish, which is a common and positive intent. The author's response might seem trivial, but the context of being with a partner who dislikes phone use makes it significant. The girlfriend's reaction is more about the behavior during their meal than the message itself. The author's frustration about paying for dinner adds another layer of stress, but it's possible that the main issue was the phone use, which led to her upset.\n\nConsidering all factors: the girlfriend's established dislike for phone use during meals, the assumption about who pays (which might not have been clear), and the resulting emotional response. The author's actions, while possibly minor, led to the girlfriend's distress. The author might not have intended harm, but the outcome shows that their action crossed a boundary. The financial issue is a separate point but contributes to the overall tension.\n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is crucial. Even if the action seems small, if it's a known issue for the partner, the person might be in the wrong for not adhering to that boundary. The author's anger about not being allowed to reply and the financial aspect might make sense on their end, but in terms of the immediate conflict, the phone use was the trigger. So, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't respect the girlfriend's established boundary, leading to the conflict.\n"
