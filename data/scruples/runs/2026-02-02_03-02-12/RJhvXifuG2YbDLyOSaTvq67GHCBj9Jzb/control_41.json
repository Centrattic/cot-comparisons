Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a birthday dinner where the author replied to his sister's message, leading to his girlfriend being upset. Let's look at the key points.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend doesn't like when he uses his phone during meals. He did check his phone when she messaged him, which upset her. That's a clear point where he might be at fault. Using the phone in a public place when the girlfriend is uncomfortable with it could be seen as disrespectful. Even if it was a birthday message, not putting the phone away after reading it might have been a mistake.\n\nThen there's the issue of paying for dinner. The author assumed his girlfriend would pay, but she ended up paying. The user mentions he had just emptied his savings to pay off a loan, so maybe he's in a tight financial spot. However, assuming someone else will pay without discussing it can be problematic. It's a common issue where people have different expectations about splitting bills. The girlfriend might feel disrespected if he didn't pay his share, especially if they usually split or she pays when they go out.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend asked if he wanted to go out for dinner, implying it's for his birthday. If he went along without clarifying payment expectations, that's on him. He might have thought it was a gesture from her, but not discussing financial responsibilities beforehand led to a conflict.\n\nPutting it all together: The main issues are using the phone despite her dislike for it and the assumption about paying. Both actions led to her being upset. While the financial situation is understandable, not communicating about payment and using the phone were mistakes. So the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
