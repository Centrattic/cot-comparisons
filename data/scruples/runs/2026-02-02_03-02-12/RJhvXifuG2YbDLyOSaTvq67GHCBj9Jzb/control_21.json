I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong (AITA) for replying to his sister's \"Happy Birthday\" message during dinner with his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the sister doesn't like when he uses his phone when they're out. The girlfriend was upset after he replied, and she wouldn't talk to him the rest of the night. Also, he had to pay for dinner, assuming she would. He mentions he's tight on money after paying off a loan.\n\nSo, the main points are: using the phone upset the girlfriend, leading to a bad date, and he ended up paying for dinner. The sister's message was a birthday wish, which might be important to acknowledge. But the girlfriend's boundaries about phone use are clear. \n\nHe had to pay, which adds to his frustration. He thought she would cover the dinner, but she didn't. The situation is a combination of violating the girlfriend's rule on phone use and financial misassumptions. \n\nThe sister's message is valid, but the context of being on a date might make checking it inappropriate. The girlfriend's reaction is about respecting her boundaries. The user is angry about the situation, but maybe he should have considered her feelings first. \n\nAlso, he didn't clarify the payment expectations beforehand, leading to an uncomfortable situation. Both issues (phone use and payment) contribute to the conflict. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because he didn't respect the girlfriend's wishes and made assumptions about payment.\n"
