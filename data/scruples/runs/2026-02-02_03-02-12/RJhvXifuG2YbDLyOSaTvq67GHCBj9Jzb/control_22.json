Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is wrong for replying to his sister's birthday message while they were out to eat with their girlfriend. The situation is a bit complex with multiple factors.\n\nFirst, the sister doesn't like the author using his phone when they're out. So, replying to the message might have upset her. The author says he replied to a birthday message, which is a common courtesy. But if the girlfriend is against phone use during meals, that could be a point of contention. The girlfriend then didn't talk to him the rest of the night, which suggests she was hurt or angry about his phone use. \n\nThen there's the issue of paying for dinner. The author thought the girlfriend was paying, but she had to pay instead. The author mentions he just paid off a loan and emptied his accounts, so he didn't expect to pay. The girlfriend might have felt he should have known or communicated better about splitting the bill. \n\nThe sister's role here is a bit unclear. She asked if they wanted to go out for a birthday dinner, so maybe she was involved in the planning. The author might have thought the dinner was for his birthday, but if the sister was also involved, perhaps there was an expectation of her covering the cost. However, the main conflict seems to be between the author and his girlfriend. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate if the girlfriend had made it clear she didn't want phone use during meals. However, replying to a birthday message is a common social norm. The payment issue could be a matter of communication. If the author assumed she was paying without discussing it, that might be his fault. But if it's a usual practice for her to pay, then maybe not. \n\nThe key points are: did the author consider his girlfriend's preference about phone use, and did he communicate or have an understanding about splitting the bill? If he knew she didn't like phones during meals and did it anyway, he's in the wrong. If he had no prior discussion about splitting the bill, maybe he's not at fault for assuming. The sister's involvement might complicate things, but the main issue is between the author and his girlfriend. \n\nSo, putting it all together: using the phone could be seen as dismissive of the girlfriend's feelings, and assuming she'd pay without knowing her situation might be inconsiderate. The author might be in the wrong for both actions.\n"
