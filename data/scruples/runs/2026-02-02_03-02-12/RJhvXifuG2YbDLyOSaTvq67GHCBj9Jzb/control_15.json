I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The author is a 34-year-old male who replied to his sister's birthday message while they were out to eat with his girlfriend. His girlfriend doesn't like when he uses his phone in public, and after the incident, she didn't talk to him the rest of the night. He's upset because he had to pay for dinner, thinking his sister was paying. Also, he mentions he just paid off a loan and was low on funds, which affected his decision to go out.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is whether the author was wrong for replying to his sister's message. The girlfriend's dislike of phone use in public is a key point. If he knew this was a pet peeve of hers, then using his phone would be disrespectful. Even if it was just a birthday message, the act of looking at his phone could be seen as dismissive during their dinner. The girlfriend's reaction (not talking for the rest of the night) suggests that this was a significant issue for her.\n\nThen there's the financial aspect. He thought his sister would pay, but she didn't. He ended up paying, which added to his frustration. However, the assumption that the sister would pay might not have been clear. The sister asked if he wanted to go out for dinner, but it's unclear if she intended to pay. If there was no prior agreement on who would pay, then it's possible the author made a wrong assumption. But his financial situation (emptying savings to pay off a loan) complicates things. He might have been under financial stress, which is a valid concern.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions\u2014using the phone despite knowing the girlfriend's preference\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate. The girlfriend's reaction is a valid consequence of that action. While the financial part adds to his frustration, the main issue is the phone use. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for disregarding his girlfriend's wishes, even if he had a valid reason for being upset about the dinner cost.\n"
