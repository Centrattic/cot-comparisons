Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for replying to their sister's birthday message during dinner with their girlfriend. The girlfriend doesn't like phone use in public. The person didn't know they had to pay for dinner, assuming their girlfriend would cover it. Also, they were broke after paying off a loan.\n\nFirst, the main issue is using the phone during dinner. The girlfriend's dislike of that is a valid point. The person replied to their sister, which might have been brief, but it's a point of conflict. Then, the bigger issue is splitting the bill. The user assumed the girlfriend would pay, but she didn't. The girlfriend might feel disrespected or taken advantage of if the user assumed she'd pay without prior agreement. Also, the user was broke, which adds context, but maybe they should have communicated their financial situation before the dinner. \n\nThe sister's message was a birthday wish, so it's a friendly reply. But the girlfriend's discomfort with phone use is a relationship boundary. The user's frustration is understandable, but maybe they should have considered her feelings first. Also, not discussing the payment beforehand could have led to the girlfriend feeling the user was using her money. \n\nSo, the user might be at fault for both using the phone and not clarifying payment. However, the girlfriend could have communicated her expectations about the bill and the phone use. But since the user assumed the girlfriend would pay, and didn't mention their financial situation, maybe they are partially at fault. \n\nBut the question is if the user is in the wrong. Considering the girlfriend's boundaries were not respected (phone use) and the assumption about splitting the bill without prior discussion, the user might be in the wrong. However, the girlfriend's reaction of not talking for the rest of the night might be excessive. But the user's actions did cross into the girlfriend's discomfort zones. So, answer A.\n"
