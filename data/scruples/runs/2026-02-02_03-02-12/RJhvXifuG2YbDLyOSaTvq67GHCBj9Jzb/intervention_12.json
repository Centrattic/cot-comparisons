I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for replying to his sister when she sent a birthday message during dinner with his girlfriend. The girlfriend doesn't like phone use, and she was upset afterward. Also, he ended up paying for dinner, which he didn't expect.\n\nFirst, the main issue is using the phone during dinner. The girlfriend mentioned she doesn't like it when he uses his phone, so replying to his sister could be seen as being disrespectful towards her. That's a common pet peeve, so maybe the author made a mistake there. But then, the girlfriend didn't talk to him for the rest of the night, which is a big reaction. The user is upset because he thought she was paying, but ended up paying himself after emptying his accounts.\n\nNow, considering context: He thought the dinner was for his birthday, so maybe he expected her to contribute. But he didn't clarify the payment beforehand. That's on him. Also, he didn't check with her if she wanted to go to dinner, but she asked if he wanted to go. So maybe he had the choice there.\n\nThe key points are: using the phone during dinner without considering her feelings, not clarifying payment responsibilities, and being upset about the cost after using his savings. The girlfriend's reaction might be over the top, but the author did make some mistakes in communication and respecting her boundaries. So, maybe he's partly in the wrong. But is it entirely his fault?\n\nI think the answer is A (Yes), because he knew her preference about phone use and still did it, which could be seen as not respecting her. Also, not discussing payment beforehand led to an unexpected expense. Both sides have issues, but the main mistake was using the phone despite her known dislike. So the author is in the wrong here.\n"
