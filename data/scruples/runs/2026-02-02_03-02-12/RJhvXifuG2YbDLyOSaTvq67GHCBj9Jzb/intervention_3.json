Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for replying to his sister's birthday message during a dinner with his girlfriend. The key points here are the girlfriend's preference against phone use during meals, the author's response leading to her silence for the rest of the night, the financial aspect of paying for dinner, and the fact that the girlfriend asked if he wanted dinner.\n\nFirst, the sister sent a birthday message, which is a common gesture. The author replied, but his girlfriend doesn't like him using his phone in public, especially during dates. This could be seen as a boundary the girlfriend set, which the author might have overstepped by checking his phone. Replying to a birthday message might be socially acceptable, but if it's something the girlfriend has communicated as a pet peeve, it's possible the author didn't respect that boundary.\n\nThen there's the issue of the dinner payment. The girlfriend asked if he wanted to go out for dinner, which might imply she was expecting to split the costs or maybe even that she would pay. The author felt he had to pay because he was broke, which adds to his frustration. However, assuming someone else would pay without confirmation could be a miscommunication. The girlfriend might have expected him to clarify if he couldn't afford it, but he might not have known she was willing to pay.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. Did he violate a clear boundary by using his phone? If the girlfriend had previously expressed discomfort with phone use during meals, then yes, he might have been in the wrong. But if it was a one-off response and not a repeated issue, maybe not. The financial part is more about expectations. If she expected him to pay and he couldn't, that's a problem on both sides. He didn't mention his financial situation beforehand, which could be a point of contention. However, the main issue seems to be the phone use leading to her not talking to him. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, and I can see that if the birthday reply was brief and necessary. But if the girlfriend has a clear rule against phone use during meals, the author should respect that. The financial aspect complicates things, but the main question is about the phone. So, it's a balance between respecting boundaries and the context of the situation. If the girlfriend's silence was over a minor phone use, maybe she overreacted. But if it's a recurring issue, the author might need to adjust. Given the information, I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong, but there's room for both sides.\n"
