I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for replying to their sister's birthday message while out to dinner with their girlfriend. The sister doesn't like when the person uses their phone during meals. After the reply, the sister was upset and didn't talk the rest of the night. Also, the person had to pay for dinner, thinking the sister would, and they were in a financial bind.\n\nFirst, the key points are: the sister's preference about phone use, the response leading to her silence, the financial aspect of paying for dinner, and the context of the invitation. The person might think they were doing something nice by responding to their sister's birthday message, but the sister was upset because of the phone use. However, the sister's reaction seems harsh, especially if the person was just acknowledging her message. The financial part adds another layer\u2014maybe the sister expected to pay, but the person assumed the opposite. The sister's behavior of cutting off communication for the rest of the night seems extreme. The person's frustration is understandable given their financial situation and the sister's mixed messages about paying. The sister's main issue seems to be the phone use, but if she's upset about that, maybe the person could have explained it was just a quick reply. However, the sister's reaction might be more about her own feelings rather than the actual action. It's a bit of a grey area. The person might be in the wrong for not considering the sister's feelings about phone use, but the sister's overreaction and financial expectation also play a role. The person's anger stems from both the sister's reaction and the unexpected cost. Maybe the person should have communicated better about the payment beforehand, but the sister's behavior after seems excessive. So, considering all factors, the person isn't entirely in the wrong, but there's room for both perspectives. However, the sister's actions might be more at fault for the overreaction. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
