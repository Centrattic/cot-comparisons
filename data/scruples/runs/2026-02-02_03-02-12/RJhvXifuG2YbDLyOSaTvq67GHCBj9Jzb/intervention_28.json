Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author replied to his sister's birthday message during a dinner with his girlfriend, which the girlfriend doesn't like. The girlfriend then didn't talk to him the rest of the night. The author is upset because he had to pay for dinner, thought she was paying, and mentions financial strain from paying off a loan.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are replying to the sister during dinner and the payment issue. The girlfriend's dislike of phone use during meals is established. The author replied to a birthday message, which might be considered rude if the girlfriend had previously set boundaries. Also, the financial aspect where the author assumed the girlfriend was paying, but she wasn't, and he had to cover it, which adds to his frustration. \n\nBut the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate because he used his phone despite the girlfriend's preferences. However, the girlfriend's reaction of not talking for the rest of the night could be seen as overreacting, but maybe it's justified if she had communicated her feelings before. The payment issue is a separate point; the author might feel taken advantage of, but if he assumed she was paying without explicit agreement, that's on him. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The act of replying to the sister during dinner, knowing the girlfriend's preference, could be a mistake. The financial part is a mutual misunderstanding. So, the main issue is the phone use. The answer would be A (yes, in the wrong) if the phone use was disrespectful despite her stated dislike. But if the birthday message was a legitimate exception, maybe not. However, the girlfriend's reaction is severe, but the author's action might still be at fault. So, leaning towards A.\n"
