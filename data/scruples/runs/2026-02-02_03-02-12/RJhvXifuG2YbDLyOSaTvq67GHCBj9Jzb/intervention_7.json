      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is wrong for replying to their sister's birthday message during a dinner with their girlfriend. The sister doesn't like the author using his phone when they're out, and after the reply, she didn't talk to him the rest of the night.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they were out to eat with his girlfriend. The sister sent a \"Happy Birthday\" message. The key point here is that the sister doesn't like when he uses his phone during their outings. So, replying to a message during dinner could be seen as disrespectful to her, especially if she's already made it clear she doesn't want him on his phone. That's a point against the author.\n\nThen, after replying, the sister didn't talk to him the rest of the night. The author is upset about this and also mentions he had to pay for dinner, thinking she would. He also says he emptied his savings and checking to pay off a loan, so he's in a tight financial spot. He wasn't sure about going out if he knew he'd have to pay, but the sister asked if he wanted to go for dinner.\n\nThe author's position is that he's not in the wrong. But considering the sister's feelings about phone use, replying to a message during dinner might have been a breach of her boundaries. Even if the message was a birthday wish, consistently respecting her preference could have prevented the conflict. Additionally, the financial aspect complicates things, but the main issue here is the phone use. The sister's reaction (not talking for the rest of the night) suggests she felt disrespected or prioritized less than his sister's message. \n\nHowever, the author might argue that a birthday message is a valid exception. But if the sister had already established that phone use is off-limits during their outings, even a quick reply could be seen as crossing a line. The fact that he had to pay for dinner might add to his frustration, but it's a separate issue. \n\nSo, considering both sides: the sister's established boundaries about phone use vs. the author's response to a birthday message. The author might be in the wrong because he didn't respect her boundary, leading to her not talking to him. But the sister might be overreacting because a birthday message is a common and reasonable thing to reply to. However, the sister's feelings are valid if she's consistently asked him not to use his phone. \n\nIn most situations, respecting a partner's boundaries is crucial. Even if the message was brief, the sister's preference should take precedence. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not adhering to her established rule, leading to the fallout.\n"
