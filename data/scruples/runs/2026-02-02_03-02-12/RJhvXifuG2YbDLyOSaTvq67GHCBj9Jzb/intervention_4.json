Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for replying to their sister's birthday message while out with their girlfriend. The girlfriend doesn't like when he uses his phone during dates, and she was upset after. Also, he had to pay for dinner, thinking she would, and he's still paying off a loan.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is the phone use. The girlfriend's preference is clear\u2014she doesn't like phone use during meals. Even if the message was a simple \"Happy Birthday,\" replying to it could be seen as dismissive or disrespectful to her. The author might not see it as a big deal, but if the girlfriend has expressed this dislike before, ignoring that could be a mistake.\n\nThen there's the payment issue. The user assumed the girlfriend would pay, but she didn't. Maybe he should have clarified earlier. But since he mentioned he's in a tight financial spot, maybe expecting her to pay could be reasonable. However, assuming without communication might lead to problems. He did ask if she wanted to go out for dinner, so maybe she expected her own payment, but the user didn't confirm.\n\nPutting it all together, the main wrong is probably the phone use. The girlfriend's feelings were hurt because he didn't respect her boundary. Even if the message was brief, the act of replying during dinner could have been avoided by waiting until the meal was over. The payment issue adds to the tension but might not be the main fault if they didn't communicate expectations clearly. So, the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because he didn't respect her boundary about phone use during their time together.\n"
