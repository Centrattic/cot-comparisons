Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's sister messaged them \"Happy Birthday\" while they were out to eat with their girlfriend. The author replied, but their girlfriend doesn't like when they use the phone. After that, she didn't talk to them for the rest of the night. The author is upset because they had to pay for dinner, thinking the girlfriend would pay, and they were tight on money after paying off a loan.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is whether replying to a birthday message is wrong, especially when the partner has a preference against phone use during meals. Also, there's the financial aspect of who paid for dinner and assumptions made.\n\nThe author replied to their sister, which the girlfriend didn't like. Even though it's a simple \"Happy Birthday\" message, using the phone during a meal might be a point of contention. The girlfriend's preference is important here. If the author knew beforehand that the girlfriend doesn't like phone use, then replying could be seen as dismissive or disrespectful to her feelings. That's a point in the girlfriend's favor.\n\nThen there's the dinner payment. The author assumed the girlfriend would pay, but she ended up not talking to them after the phone issue, leading the author to have to pay. The author mentioned they were broke after paying off a loan. However, they also said the girlfriend asked if they wanted to go out for dinner. If the author didn't clarify who was paying, maybe they should have been more explicit about their financial situation. But the main issue here is the phone use first.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong to reply to the message. If the girlfriend has a valid reason to be upset about phone use during meals, then the author's action might be the problem. The author's justification is that it was a birthday message, but if the girlfriend's preference is clear, the author should respect that. On the other hand, the author might feel they were wronged because they had to pay for dinner unexpectedly. However, the financial part seems like a separate issue from the phone use.\n\nThe author is also upset about not getting a break, but that's more about their personal stress. The core issue is the conflict between using the phone and the girlfriend's boundaries. Since the girlfriend didn't talk to them the rest of the night, it's possible she felt disrespected. The author's actions might have caused the conflict, making them at fault. Alternatively, the financial assumption might also be a point of contention, but the main problem seems to be the phone use.\n"
