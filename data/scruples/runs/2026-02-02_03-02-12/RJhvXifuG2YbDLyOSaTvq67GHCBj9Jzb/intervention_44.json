Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about replying to a sister's birthday message while on a date with his girlfriend, which led to the girlfriend being upset and not talking to him for the rest of the night. Also, he had to pay for dinner, thinking she would cover it, and he's financially strained from paying off a loan.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the phone use. The girlfriend doesn't like him using his phone when they're out. He replied to his sister, which she found irritating. The user's opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, but we need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective, she might feel neglected or that he's not giving her full attention. Using the phone during dinner can be a red flag for some people, leading to feelings of being unimportant in the moment. Even a simple reply could be seen as a breach of her boundaries, especially if she's communicated that before.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had a valid reason: a birthday message from a family member. Birthdays are significant, and replying to family could be considered a normal, polite response. However, the key here is whether he was aware of her feelings about phone use. If she had mentioned it before, he might be at fault for not respecting her boundaries. If he didn't know, maybe it's a misunderstanding.\n\nThe second issue is the dinner payment. The author assumed the girlfriend would pay, but she expected him to. This could be a miscommunication. If she asked if he wanted to go out for his birthday dinner, maybe there's an expectation that she's treating him. But if it's a mutual dinner, splitting the bill or taking turns is common. However, the author was financially strained, which adds context. But assuming someone else will pay without confirmation can lead to awkwardness.\n\nPutting it all together: The phone issue is about respecting boundaries. If the girlfriend had previously expressed discomfort with phone use, the author should have been more cautious. The dinner payment is a communication problem on both sides. The author didn't clarify payment expectations, and the girlfriend didn't confirm. But the main conflict seems to stem from the phone use. Since the girlfriend was upset about the phone reply and the author didn't consider her feelings, even if it was a quick message, he might be in the wrong for not prioritizing her comfort. However, replying to a family member's birthday message is a valid action. It's a bit of a grey area, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong for not respecting her established boundaries, even if the action itself was minor.\n"
