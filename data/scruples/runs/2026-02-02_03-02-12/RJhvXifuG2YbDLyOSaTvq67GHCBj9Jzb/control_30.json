Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is that he replied to his sister's birthday message while out to eat with his girlfriend, which upset her. The girlfriend doesn't like him using his phone in public. Also, he ended up paying for dinner, which he didn't expect, and he felt it was a financial strain because he had just paid off a loan.\n\nFirst, the main issue is him replying to his sister during dinner. The girlfriend had previously expressed that she doesn't like when he uses his phone during their time together. So, by replying, he might have disregarded her feelings, even if it was a birthday message. That could be seen as inconsiderate, especially since she had mentioned her dislike of phone use before. \n\nThen there's the financial part. The girlfriend asked if he wanted to go out for a birthday dinner. The user assumed she would pay, but he ended up paying. However, unless there was a prior agreement, assuming someone else will pay can be problematic. Birthdays are often seen as a time when the person being celebrated might pay, but it's not a given. If he didn't clarify who would pay, that's on him. He might have misread the situation there.\n\nThe user is also upset that he had to pay after emptying his savings and checking. That shows financial stress, but that's his own responsibility for not confirming the payment arrangement. The girlfriend might feel that he didn't communicate his financial constraints before agreeing to the dinner.\n\nPutting it all together: He replied to his sister during dinner, which upset her. He assumed she would pay without confirming, leading to an argument. Both actions could be seen as his fault. The sister's message was personal, but the girlfriend's boundaries about phone use were already established. The user's failure to communicate his financial situation and his assumption about payment contribute to the conflict. So, he's in the wrong for both actions.\n"
