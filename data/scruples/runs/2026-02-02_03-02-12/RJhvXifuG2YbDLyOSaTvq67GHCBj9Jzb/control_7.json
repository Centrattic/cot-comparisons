Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation involves them replying to their sister's birthday message while out to eat with their girlfriend, which upset the girlfriend because she doesn't like phone use during their time together. Then, the girlfriend didn't talk to him the rest of the night. Additionally, he had to pay for dinner, thinking she would, and he was stressed because he had just paid off a loan and emptied his accounts.\n\nFirst, the main issue is using the phone. The girlfriend's dislike of phone use during their time together is mentioned, so the author's action here might be seen as dismissive or disrespectful. Even a quick reply could be frustrating if that's a boundary she set. It's important to respect a partner's boundaries, especially if they've communicated them before.\n\nThen there's the money part. The author assumed the girlfriend would pay, but she didn't. If he had known he had to pay, maybe he wouldn't have gone. But did he know that? The girlfriend asked if he wanted to go out for dinner, not specifying who would pay. Maybe there's an unspoken custom here, like splitting or taking turns, but if he assumed she would pay and she expected him to, that's a miscommunication. However, the author's financial situation is a factor\u2014emptying savings to pay off a loan could add context. But assuming someone else will pay might still be his responsibility if there's no prior agreement.\n\nThe sister's message was happy birthday, so a quick reply seems reasonable. However, the girlfriend's reaction might be about the principle of phone use during their time together. If she's been clear about this before, then the author's actions could be inconsiderate. On the other hand, sometimes unexpected messages happen, and a short reply isn't unreasonable.\n\nPutting it all together: The main issue is the phone use during the dinner. If the girlfriend has communicated that she doesn't like it, then the author should have been more mindful, perhaps by texting quickly or not at all. The financial aspect is a separate issue but might contribute to his frustration. However, the initial act of replying to his sister, while brief, could have been the trigger for her not talking to him the rest of the night. So, there's a good chance the author is in the wrong for not respecting the boundary about phone use. The financial part is more about a miscommunication but doesn't necessarily make him wrong unless he knew the payment arrangement beforehand.\n"
