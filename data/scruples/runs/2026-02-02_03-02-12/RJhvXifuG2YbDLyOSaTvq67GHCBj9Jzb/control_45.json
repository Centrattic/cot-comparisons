I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for replying to his sister's birthday message while out to eat with his girlfriend. The girlfriend doesn't like him using his phone, and she ended up not talking to him the rest of the night. Plus, he had to pay for dinner, which he wasn't expecting because he thought she was going to cover it. He mentions he just paid off a loan and emptied his accounts, so he's upset about the unexpected expense.\n\nFirst, the main issue is using the phone during dinner. The girlfriend has expressed that she doesn't like him using his phone when they're out. So, replying to the sister's message would be against her wishes. That seems like a point against the author. Relationships often require respecting each other's boundaries, and if she's communicated that clearly, then ignoring that could be his fault.\n\nSecond, the financial aspect. He thought she was paying, but she wasn't. If she asked if he wanted to go out for dinner, maybe without specifying who's paying, then it's a bit of a gray area. However, in many cultures, splitting the bill is common unless specified otherwise. But if he assumed she would pay, and she didn't, maybe he's overextending himself financially. But he also mentions he's in a tight spot financially, so expecting someone else to pay when you can't afford it might be an issue.\n\nPutting it together, the main problem is the phone use. The girlfriend's unhappiness with that led to her not talking to him. The financial part is a separate issue, but both contribute to his frustration. However, the phone use directly caused the conflict during their dinner. So, he's in the wrong for not respecting her boundaries. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
