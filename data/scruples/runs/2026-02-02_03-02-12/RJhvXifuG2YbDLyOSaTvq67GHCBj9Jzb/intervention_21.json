Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for replying to their sister's birthday message while they were out to eat with their girlfriend. Their girlfriend doesn't like when he uses his phone during dinners, and after replying, she didn't talk to him the rest of the night. Also, he ended up paying for dinner, which he didn't expect because he thought she would. He mentioned he had just paid off a loan and was low on funds, which adds to his frustration.\n\nFirst, the main issue is using the phone during dinner. The girlfriend has a clear boundary about not wanting him to use his phone when they're out. By replying to his sister, the author broke that boundary, which likely caused her to be upset. Even if the message was about his own birthday, the act of checking his phone could have been rude or dismissive from her perspective. So, there's a case that he's in the wrong for not respecting her boundary.\n\nThen there's the financial aspect. He thought she would pay, but she didn't, and he ended up paying despite having just emptied his accounts. He didn't mention this expectation before the dinner, so she might not have known. However, splitting the bill or discussing payment beforehand is usually a good idea. If he didn't communicate that he couldn't afford it, maybe he's responsible for not setting that expectation.\n\nHe also mentioned that his sister asked if he wanted to go out for dinner. But he went anyway, not realizing he'd be paying. Maybe he should have clarified the payment arrangement before going. However, the sister's question was about whether he wanted to go out, not about payment. So maybe he wasn't wrong there, but the lack of communication about splitting the bill is on him.\n\nPutting it all together: The main fault is probably using the phone despite the girlfriend's known boundary. The financial part is a separate issue but also a communication problem. The author might be in the wrong for both not respecting the phone boundary and not discussing payment beforehand. However, the girlfriend's reaction of not talking for the rest of the night is quite harsh, which might make the situation more complex. But in terms of right or wrong, the phone use is a clearer mistake.\n"
