Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for replying to his sister's birthday message during dinner with his girlfriend. The main issues here are using the phone at dinner and the girlfriend not talking to him afterward, plus the unexpected dinner payment.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's dislike for phone use during meals is mentioned. The author used his phone to respond to his sister, which upset her. That's a clear point of conflict. Relationships often have unspoken rules about phone use, so maybe the author broke one here. He should have anticipated her reaction if she's already expressed this preference before.\n\nSecond, the author had to pay for dinner, assuming she would cover it. The girlfriend asked him if he wanted to go out for his birthday dinner. If she asked and he agreed without clarification on who pays, maybe he's at fault for assuming. However, it's common in some relationships to alternate or have informal agreements. The key here is that he emptied his accounts to pay off a loan, which is a valid financial stressor, but he might have been careless in assuming she'd pay.\n\nHe's still upset, which shows he feels wronged, but his actions likely caused the girlfriend's anger. The sister's message was a trigger for using the phone, but the core issue is respecting her boundaries. The financial part adds to the problem but isn't the main wrongdoing. The main wrong is using the phone against her wishes, leading to her silence for the rest of the evening. So, the answer is A\u2014the author is in the wrong for not respecting his girlfriend's preference and miscalculating the dinner payment.\n"
