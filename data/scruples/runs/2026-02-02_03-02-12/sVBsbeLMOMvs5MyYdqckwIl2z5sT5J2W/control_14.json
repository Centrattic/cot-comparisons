      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that the user went to a club with friends, bought drinks for four people, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The user was drunk but not so much that they didn't notice the bartender adding the tip. They responded by tipping 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The user wanted to tip an appropriate amount themselves but was upset about the bartender adding the tip without asking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for service staff like bartenders. However, the expectation is usually that the customer decides the tip amount. Automatically adding a tip without informing the customer might be seen as overstepping, depending on the establishment's policy. Some places do add a gratuity for groups or large parties, but the key here is whether the bartender informed the customer beforehand.\n\nThe user's reaction: they were drunk but not incapacitated. They chose to tip 0%, which could be seen as a protest against the automatic tip. The bartender's response was to refuse service unless they tipped. This raises questions about both parties' actions. The bartender might have a policy to add a tip for groups, but not checking with the customer could be problematic. On the other hand, the user's decision to leave no tip after being asked to tip by the bartender might be seen as uncooperative.\n\nLegal perspective: In some states, automatic gratuities are allowed for large groups, but the customer should be informed. If the bartender didn't explain this, the user might have a point. However, in other contexts, if the establishment has a policy, the customer might be expected to follow it. The user's refusal to tip when asked could lead to the bartender refusing service, which might be within their rights if they have a policy.\n\nEthically, the user felt disrespected by the bartender's actions, leading to their refusal to tip. The bartender might have been trying to ensure they got a fair tip, but their method was questionable. It's a gray area. The user might not be in the wrong if the bartender didn't communicate the tip policy. However, the user could have asked for the total before paying, which might have avoided the conflict. Alternatively, the user's response was to refuse to tip entirely, which could be seen as punitive.\n\nIn conclusion, the bartender might have made a mistake by not informing the user about the automatic tip. The user's reaction was to not tip, which could be justified if they felt misled. However, the user could have handled it differently by asking for clarification or adjusting the tip after the fact. The bartender's refusal to serve might have been a policy-enforced response. The blame isn't entirely on one side; both have some responsibility. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, considering the bartender's failure to communicate the tip policy, the user might not be entirely at fault. So the answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong), but there's nuance here.\n"
