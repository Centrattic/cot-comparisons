      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is the person went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling the person. The person was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They responded by tipping 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip. The person thought they could tip appropriately themselves but the bartender adding the tip without asking upset them. The question is, is the author in the wrong?\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the service industry like bars, tipping is expected. Bartenders rely heavily on tips as part of their income. However, the key point here is that the bartender added a 20% tip without the customer's knowledge. Normally, when you pay with a card, the cashier might add a tip automatically, but some places require the customer to approve it. If the bartender did this without informing the customer, that might be an issue. The customer might feel that their autonomy was violated by the tip being added without consent.\n\nThe customer was drunk but not too drunk to notice. So they were aware of the tip being added. By telling the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk, the customer is implying that the bartender is trying to overcharge them. The bartender's response was to refuse service if the tip wasn't given. That's a bit of a problem because refusing service because a customer isn't tipping is a bit strong. Bartenders can suggest a tip, but refusing service over it might cross a line, especially if the customer is still willing to tip a reasonable amount.\n\nBut let's think about both sides. The customer might have a right to be upset because the tip was added without their knowledge. They might not have wanted to pay 20% and felt it was an automatic addition they weren't consulted about. However, in some places, it's common for servers to be tipped, and if the customer chooses not to tip, they might be asked to leave. However, the way the bartender handled it\u2014threatening not to serve\u2014might not be appropriate. Also, the fact that the customer was drunk complicates things. Being drunk doesn't absolve someone from the responsibility to tip, but the bartender's actions in adding the tip without consent might have been the catalyst for the conflict.\n\nIs there any cultural context I should consider? In some countries, tipping is automatic, but in others, it's expected to be given by the customer. The author's location might matter, but since it's not specified, we can assume it's a typical US scenario where tipping is customary. However, the key issue is the automatic tip without consent. If the bartender added it without the customer's knowledge, that's against the customer's autonomy. Therefore, the customer might not be in the wrong for objecting to that. However, by not tipping at all, they might be denying the bartender his expected income. But if the bartender was adding it without consent, that's a problem.\n\nSo, the customer's main issue was the bartender adding the tip without asking. The customer's response was to tip 0%, which is their right, but the bartender's refusal to serve is where the other side's fault might lie. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong because the bartender acted inappropriately by adding the tip without consent and then threatening to refuse service. The customer's refusal to tip in that context is a valid reaction. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
