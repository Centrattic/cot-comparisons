      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. From the situation described, the person went to a club with friends and invited them to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The person was drunk but noticed this and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them further if they didn't tip. The person claims they wanted to tip appropriately but were upset about the bartender adding the tip without consent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for service workers like bartenders. However, the key issue here is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge or consent. Normally, the customer is expected to decide the tip amount, and automatically adding it without informing could be seen as deceptive. \n\nThe person was drunk but not incapacitated. They noticed the bartender's action and decided to tip 0% as a response. The bartender then threatened not to serve them if they didn't tip. This could be seen as a power play, where the bartender is enforcing a tip policy, but if the tip wasn't disclosed beforehand, it might be against the establishment's policies. \n\nLegally, in many places, restaurants cannot add a mandatory gratuity without informing the customer. If the bartender added 20% without telling, that could be a policy violation. The customer then reacting by not tipping could be their way of standing up for themselves. \n\nHowever, from another angle, the customer might have just paid the normal amount without the added tip, but by removing it entirely, they might be seen as disrespectful or not following customs. The bartender's response of refusing service if they don't tip could be problematic because if the tip isn't mandatory, the customer isn't obligated to pay it. \n\nSo, considering the bartender's actions of adding a tip without consent, the person's response of not tipping might be justified. The bartender's refusal to serve could be an overreaction or enacting their own policy improperly. The person isn't necessarily in the wrong for not tipping in this scenario. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
