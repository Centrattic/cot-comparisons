      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user went to a club with friends, invited four of them for drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The user, who was drunk but not too drunk to notice, then decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The user claims they wanted to tip appropriately but were upset about the bartender adding the tip without consent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the service industry, tipping is expected and often left to the customer's discretion. However, some establishments automatically add a service charge, which is different from a tip. The user's issue is with the bartender adding a 20% tip without informing them. This could be a policy of the establishment or the bartender's own action. If it's a policy, the user might not have known about it, but if the bartender did it personally, that's different.\n\nThe user was drunk but still conscious enough to notice. They responded by leaving a 0% tip, which the bartender found unacceptable. The bartender's response was to refuse service. Now, the key points here are whether the bartender had the authority to add the tip without permission and whether the user's refusal was justified.\n\nIf the bartender added the tip without the user's consent, that's a problem. Tips are supposed to be voluntary. If the bartender is taking it upon himself to add a tip, that's not the customer's responsibility. However, in some places, service charges might be mandatory, but that's different from a tip. The user's refusal to tip after the bartender's action could be seen as a reaction to the bartender's unauthorized addition.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who's drunk. But being drunk doesn't negate the customer's right to choose their tip. The bartender's refusal to serve could be seen as holding their service hostage, which is also an issue. However, the bartender might have a right to set expectations for tipping, but refusing service entirely might be extreme.\n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong, if the bartender added the tip without permission, that's a problem. The user had the right to refuse to tip, even if they were upset. However, refusing to pay any tip could also be problematic because tipping is customary. But the main issue is the bartender's unauthorized addition. So, the user's action might be justified as a response to the bartender's unauthorized tip. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
