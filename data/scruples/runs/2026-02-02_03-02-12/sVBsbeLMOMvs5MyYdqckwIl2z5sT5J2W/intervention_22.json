      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four people to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The person was drunk but not too drunk to notice, and they decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, a 15-20% tip is customary for good service. However, the key here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. Normally, when you pay by card, the tip is added at the customer's discretion, often with options provided. If the bartender unilaterally added 20% without asking, that's unusual. Customers usually have control over their own tips unless the establishment has a policy of automatic gratuities, which is more common in some restaurants with large parties or for service charges in certain industries.\n\nThe person was drunk but still aware enough to notice the tip being added. They responded by not tipping, which is their right if they're unhappy with the service or the automatic addition. The bartender's threat to not serve them anymore is a strong reaction. However, in many jurisdictions, businesses can refuse service for any reason as long as it's not discriminatory. Still, the bartender's approach might be seen as heavy-handed.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. If the bartender added the tip without consent, the customer isn't obligated to pay. The author's response, while perhaps confrontational, is a reaction to the bartender's action. The bartender's refusal to serve could be within their rights, but the situation is more about the initial unauthorized tip. The author's reasoning is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of intoxicated customers, which is a valid concern. However, not tipping at all might be seen as disrespectful or against the norm, but the unauthorized addition complicates things.\n\nIn many places, automatic gratuities are allowed, especially in places like clubs where they might expect higher service charges. If the club's policy includes automatic tips, then the author should have been informed. If not, the bartender overstepped. The author's response to refuse the tip and not add any might be justified if they believe they weren't informed. But if the establishment typically adds tips, the author might be expected to know that upfront.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because the bartender acted without consent. The author had the right to decline the unauthorized tip and express their disapproval. However, the bartender's refusal to serve could be a separate issue, but that's more about the bartender's response than the author's initial action. So, I think the answer is B (No).\n"
