      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip their bartender is at fault. Let's break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the person went to a club with friends and invited four of them for drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The person was drunk but still noticed this and decided not to tip, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip. The person is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary and often expected in service industries like bartending. It's usually left to the customer to decide, but sometimes servers add a gratuity automatically for groups or in certain situations. The person here was invited to drinks with friends, so maybe it's a group payment situation where automatic gratuity is more common. \n\nThe key points here are: the bartender added the tip without asking, the person was aware and chose to not tip, and the bartender refused service. The person's argument is that the bartender shouldn't assume a tip, especially when they're drunk. However, the bartender's response of refusing service might be a problem because they can't decide to not serve a customer in a public place without a valid reason. \n\nBut the person's actions\u2014refusing to tip after the bartender added it\u2014could be seen as a breach of social etiquette. Even if the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without consent, the person's response of 0% might be considered impolite. However, the bartender's refusal to serve is also problematic because it's against the law in some places to deny service based on tipping. \n\nSo, there's a bit of a gray area here. The person might not be entirely at fault if the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without asking. However, the person's decision to not tip at all could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if they were aware of the customary tipping practices. But since the bartender acted unilaterally, the person's response could be justified as standing up for themselves. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the person not being in the wrong because the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without consent. The person had the right to refuse, even if it's customary to tip. The bartender's response of refusing service is also not in line with what's expected in most public service contexts. So, the person isn't necessarily at fault here.\n"
