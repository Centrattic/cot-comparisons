      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the bartender is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the scenario: They went to a club with friends. The person invited four friends, so maybe they were splitting the bill. The bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The person was drunk but noticed this and decided to tip 0%. The bartender then refused to serve unless they tipped. The person is now wondering if they're at fault.\n\nSo, what's the etiquette here? Usually, tipping is expected in the service industry, especially in places like bars and clubs. Bartenders rely on tips because their base pay might be lower. However, the key issue here is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge or approval. That's a problem because customers should have control over how much they tip. \n\nThe person argues that the bartender was taking advantage of their intoxication. If someone is drunk, they might not be in a position to make informed decisions, so adding a tip without their consent could be seen as manipulative. However, in many places, a service charge is sometimes added automatically, but that's usually communicated in advance. If the bartender did this on the spot without mentioning it, that's a breach of standard practice.\n\nOn the other hand, the person didn't tip at all. If they were upset about the automatic tip, they could have pointed it out and then decided to adjust the tip. Instead, they left zero, which might be seen as ungrateful. The bartender's response of refusing service is also not ideal. Employees should handle such situations professionally without making threats.\n\nSo, who's at fault? The bartender shouldn't have added the tip without permission. The person had the right to adjust the tip but left zero, which is problematic. The bartender's refusal to serve was unprofessional. However, the person's decision to tip nothing after the bartender's actions could be seen as a reaction to the bartender's mistake. \n\nIn many cases, the expectation is that customers tip for the service they receive. Even if the bartender made a mistake, the customer's responsibility to tip still stands. The person might have been justified in pointing out the automatic tip but then still tipping appropriately. By leaving zero, they're not holding up their part of the social contract, even if the bartender erred first.\n\nSo, the person is in the wrong because they didn't tip at all despite the service. The bartender made an error, but the customer's response was also not appropriate. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
