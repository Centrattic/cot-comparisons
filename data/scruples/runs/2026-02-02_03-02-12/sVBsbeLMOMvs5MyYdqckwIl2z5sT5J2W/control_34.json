      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks each. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing the person. The person got drunk but was still aware of the bartender adding the tip, so they decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of them. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip. The person is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for service staff like bartenders. It's expected, though not mandatory. However, adding a tip without the customer's knowledge could be seen as the bartender taking some control over the transaction, which might be where the person felt wronged. \n\nThe person's response was to tip 0%, which is against the usual practice. But their reasoning was that the bartender was taking advantage of their drunk state. However, the key point is whether the person was in the right to do so. The bartender's action of adding a tip without consent could be problematic. Typically, the customer has control over the tip amount, so the bartender's action might have been inappropriate. \n\nBut then, the person's response was to retaliate by not tipping at all. Even if they were upset, refusing to tip entirely, especially after the bartender added a tip, might not be the best approach. Maybe they could have discussed it calmly instead of cutting the tip to zero. However, the person's argument is that the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without asking. \n\nAnother angle: the person was in a group, and they invited friends to drinks, so maybe the total bill was significant. The bartender adding 20% without permission could be a red flag. The person's reaction might be justified if they felt disrespected. But in terms of social norms, tipping is expected, so not tipping could be seen as rude, regardless of the bartender's mistake. \n\nSo, the person's action was to not tip, which is against the norm. The bartender's action was also questionable. But the question is whether the person is in the wrong. If the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without asking, then the person's refusal to tip might be a consequence of the bartender's error. However, the person's choice to not tip at all is a strong reaction. They might not be entirely in the wrong because the bartender's action was inappropriate, but their response could also be seen as harsh. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the person should have tipped the appropriate amount regardless of the bartender's mistake. But if the bartender added the tip without permission, the person might feel justified in adjusting it. However, in many places, even if a server adds a tip, the customer can still choose to adjust it. But the person here chose to remove the tip entirely, which might be the problem. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the person's action was a reasonable response to the bartender's mistake. If the bartender shouldn't have done that, then the person isn't entirely wrong. But if the person should have just paid the tip and not retaliated, then they are at fault. \n\nI think the bartender made a mistake by adding the tip without informing the customer. The person's reaction was to not tip, which is a strong response but perhaps not entirely unreasonable given the bartender's action. However, the person is in the wrong because they should have handled it differently, maybe by discussing it calmly instead of refusing to tip. So, the answer might be A (At Fault).\n"
