      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the bartender is in the wrong. So, the situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four people to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The user was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They then tipped 0%, told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender threatened not to serve them if they didn't tip. The user says they wanted to tip appropriately but were upset about the bartender adding the tip without permission.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary and expected for service workers like bartenders. The usual rate is 15-20%, so the bartender adding 20% is within that range. However, the issue here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. Normally, when you pay by card, you can select the tip amount, but the bartender might have manually added it without the customer's knowledge. That's a problem because the customer wasn't given a choice, which is important because tipping should be voluntary.\n\nThe user was drunk but not incapacitated. They noticed the bartender adding the tip, which is a key point. They responded by leaving 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip. Now, in a restaurant or bar, if a customer refuses to tip, the server can refuse service, but the customer also has the right to leave. However, in this case, the user had already paid and was leaving, so the bartender's threat might be more about confrontation than actual enforcement.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without permission. The user wanted to tip but on their own terms. The bartender's action of adding the tip without asking could be seen as taking advantage, especially since the user was drunk. But the user's response of leaving 0% might be seen as cutting off the bartender's tip, which they rely on for income. However, if the bartender added it without consent, then the user isn't responsible for that amount. The user's action was a reaction to the bartender's unauthorized addition.\n\nSo, who's at fault here? The bartender's main mistake was adding the tip without the customer's knowledge. The user's response was to not tip, which is their right, but in doing so, they might be seen as retaliating. However, the core issue is the bartender's action. The user could have just paid the bill as is and not tipped, but instead, they made a point of refusing to tip because of the bartender's action. The bartender's threat to not serve them if they didn't tip is also problematic because the user had already left the payment process and was about to exit, so the threat might be more about confrontation than a real service issue.\n\nSo, considering all this, the user isn't in the wrong. The bartender made the first move by adding the tip without permission, and the user reacted by not tipping, which is their right. The bartender's refusal to serve them further is aggressive. Therefore, the answer would be B (the user is not in the wrong).\n"
