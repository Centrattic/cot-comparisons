      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four others to drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without permission. The person was drunk but not too much to notice, and they responded by not tipping, leading to a confrontation where the bartender refused service.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the service industry, tipping is expected as a way for workers to earn a living. However, it's typically up to the customer to decide the amount. The bartender adding a tip without informing the customer is unusual. Normally, tips are left by the customer, not automatically added by the server unless the establishment has a specific policy. If the bartender did this without the customer's knowledge, that could be a breach of trust.\n\nThe customer's reaction is to not tip at all. That's a strong response, but they were upset that the bartender took initiative. The customer might feel that the bartender is taking advantage, especially mentioning that they were drunk. However, being drunk doesn't absolve someone from not tipping; it's more about the bartender's action. \n\nThe bartender's response of refusing service if they don't tip seems problematic. In many places, businesses can't force customers to tip, and refusing service because the tip wasn't added might be against labor laws or business practices. The customer's argument is that they wanted to tip an appropriate amount themselves, so the bartender shouldn't impose their own tip.\n\nSo, the key points are: \n1. Bartender added tip without consent.\n2. Customer had the right to decide the tip amount.\n3. Bartender's refusal to serve based on tip amount could be an issue.\n\nI think the author is justified in their response. The bartender's action was the problem, not the customer's refusal to tip. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
