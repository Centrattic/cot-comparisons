      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends for drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The person was drunk but noticed this and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people. The bartender then refused to serve them anymore if they didn't tip. The person says they wanted to tip appropriately but the bartender adding the tip without asking was the issue.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are: the bartender added a tip without asking, the person was drunk but still aware, they refused to tip, and the bartender threatened not to serve them. \n\nIn many places, tips are supposed to be discretionary and left by the customer. Automatically adding a tip without the customer's consent might be against the rules in some establishments. However, the person's reaction was to not tip at all, which could be seen as a refusal to pay any tip, which might be considered rude or inconsiderate. But the bartender's action of adding the tip without permission seems like the initial problem. \n\nThe person argues that the bartender was taking advantage by adding the tip himself, so they refused. But is it acceptable to not tip at all? Even if the tip was added without consent, the person could have left a smaller tip or just paid the bill as is. Refusing to tip entirely, especially when the bartender was trying to add it, might be seen as rude. However, the bartender's action was also questionable. \n\nIn some cases, automatic gratuities are allowed in some businesses, like for large groups or events, but not typically for regular transactions. If the establishment allows it, maybe the bartender was following policy, but if not, he might have overstepped. The person's decision to not tip could be a reaction to that, but they didn't mention if they asked for the tip to be removed. \n\nSo, the person might be in the wrong because they didn't tip at all, but the bartender's initial action was also inappropriate. However, in many cultures, tipping is expected, and refusing to tip could be seen as disrespectful, even if the tip was added without permission. The person could have addressed the tip issue by discussing it politely, like asking to adjust the tip amount instead of leaving nothing. \n\nSo maybe the answer is A (the person is in the wrong) because they didn't tip at all, which is considered rude in many contexts, even if the bartender made a mistake. The person could have handled it differently, like asking to remove the automatic tip and then leaving their own appropriate amount instead of zero.\n"
