      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is at fault for not tipping the bartender. The scenario is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends for drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The author was drunk but not so much that they couldn't notice the bartender trying to add the tip. They responded by leaving 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage of drunks. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip. The author wanted to tip an appropriate amount themselves but was upset about the bartender adding the tip without consent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the standard tipping etiquette. In many places, especially in the service industry like bars, tipping is customary and often expected. Bartenders rely on tips as a significant part of their income. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. Normally, if a place adds a gratuity automatically, it's usually mentioned on the menu or at the time of service. If the customer is not informed, that could be a problem.\n\nThe author was drunk but not excessively so, so they could still notice the bartender's action. Their response was to leave 0%, which is against the norm. However, the bartender's action of adding the tip without permission might be seen as overstepping. The bartender's threat to not serve them if they didn't tip could also be an issue, as the establishment can't legally refuse service based on tipping, especially if the customer is not causing a disturbance.\n\nOn one hand, the author didn't tip, which might be seen as wrong in typical scenarios. But here, the bartender took initiative without consent, which the author found offensive. The author's intention was to tip an appropriate amount themselves. The bartender's behavior of adding the tip without informing could be at fault. The author's reaction, while confrontational, might be a response to that perceived overreach.\n\nSo, considering all factors: the bartender's unauthorized addition of the tip, the author's state of being drunk but not incapacitated, and the bartender's refusal to serve, I think the author isn't entirely at fault. The bartender's actions were questionable. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
