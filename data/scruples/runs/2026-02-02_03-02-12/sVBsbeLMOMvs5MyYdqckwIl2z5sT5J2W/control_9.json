      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four people to four drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The author got drunk but still noticed this and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, a common tip is 15-20%, and sometimes the total includes a gratuity. However, it's generally expected that the customer is informed if a tip is being added automatically. If the bartender didn't mention it, that could be an issue because the customer might not know they're being charged extra. The author noticed the tip being added, which they found unacceptable, especially since they were already paying for multiple drinks for friends. The author's response was to not tip at all, which led to a confrontation.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the bartender added the tip without consent. Typically, even if there's an automatic tip, the customer should be informed. The author's reaction, though, was to leave 0%, which might be seen as unfair because the bartender did his job. However, the bartender's refusal to serve because of it might be overstepping. The author didn't want to be taken advantage of while drunk, which is a reasonable concern. But the problem is whether not tipping is justified. If the service was good, not tipping could be considered rude regardless of the bartender's mistake. However, the key point is the bartender's failure to inform the customer about the tip. So the blame might be shared. The author might not be entirely wrong because the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without consent. But the author's decision to tip 0% could be seen as a harsh response. Alternatively, maybe the author should have just paid the correct amount and not fought over the tip. It's a bit of a gray area. In some places, tipping is mandatory, but in others, it's discretionary. Since the author was paying for multiple drinks, maybe the total was already high, making the additional tip a point of contention. The bartender's threat to not serve them further complicates things. Overall, the author's action might not be entirely wrong because the bartender's behavior was inappropriate, but there's a case that the author should have handled it differently, like asking about the tip before proceeding. But given the bartender's mistake, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
