I invited them (4 people) to 4 drinks. When I was paying, the bartender himself put a 20% tip without telling me. Now I was pretty drunk, but not enough to not notice him trying to put the tip percentage on his own. I responded by tipping him 0% telling him to not take advantage of people who are drunk. He responded by saying that he won't serve me anymore if I don't tip him. I was willing to tip an appropriate amount myself, but him just putting in a 20% tip without telling me rubbed me the wrong way.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that the author invited four friends to drinks, so maybe they were splitting the bill. The bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The author was drunk but not too drunk to notice this. They refused to tip, told the bartender not to take advantage, and the bartender then refused to serve them. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know what I think.\n\nFirst, tipping norms vary by country and establishment. In some places, tipping is expected, but sometimes a service charge is included. If the bartender added a tip without asking, that might be against the establishment's policy. Bartenders usually rely on tips for a significant part of their income, so refusing to tip could be seen as unfair. However, if the tip was added without consent, it's a problem. The author might feel it's a violation of their autonomy. The bartender's response of refusing service if they don't tip could be seen as unacceptable, as service shouldn't be contingent on tips. But the author's decision to not tip after the bartender took initiative could be a defense of their right to choose how much to tip. The key points are: unauthorized tip addition, whether it's part of the establishment's policy, and the bartender's right to refuse service. If adding the tip was against the bar's policy, the author has a point. But if it's standard there, then the author might be wrong. Since the bartender took it upon himself, it's more the bartender's fault for not following protocol. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B."
