      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends to drinks, and when paying, the bartender automatically added a 20% tip without telling them. The author got upset, tipped 0%, told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people, and the bartender threatened not to serve them. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected for service jobs, and 15-20% is common. But the key here is that the bartender added the tip without asking. Normally, when you pay with a card, sometimes the system might have a default tip, but the customer can adjust it. However, in some cases, especially if it's a tip jar or the server is supposed to collect tips, adding it without consent might be an issue.\n\nThe author was drunk but not too drunk to notice the bartender adding the tip. So they were aware enough to act. The bartender's action of adding the tip without informing them might be the root of the conflict. The author felt it was an overreach and decided to not tip, which led to the bartender refusing service. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, if the bartender's job is to collect tips as part of their pay, then expecting a tip is part of their role. However, if the bartender added a tip without the customer's knowledge, that's a problem. The author's response was to not tip, which could be seen as a justified reaction to being overcharged without consent. But in typical tipping culture, customers usually have the option to tip or not, even if there's a default. If the author felt the tip was forced, they had the right to adjust it. However, the response of tipping 0% might have been too harsh. Maybe a more appropriate action would be to adjust the tip to a lower amount or discuss it then. The bartender's refusal to serve could be a separate issue, as threatening service might be on them.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is the bartender adding the tip without asking. If the author had the right to adjust the tip, then not tipping could be a reaction to an inappropriate action. However, if tips are supposed to be left regardless, then the author might be at fault. But the key here is the bartender's action of adding it without consent. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because the bartender shouldn't have done that. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
