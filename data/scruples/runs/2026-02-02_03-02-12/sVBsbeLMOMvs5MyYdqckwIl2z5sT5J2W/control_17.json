      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they went to a club with friends, bought drinks for four people, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The author was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They responded by tipping 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to recall tipping etiquette. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected for services like bartending. The standard is usually 15-20%, but it's not mandatory. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the 20% tip without consulting the customer. That might be a problem because the customer should have control over their own payment, including tips. If the bartender assumed the tip without permission, that's probably not right. \n\nThe author was drunk but not intoxicated enough to make decisions impaired. They noticed the bartender's action and decided to leave a 0% tip as a response. The reasoning here is that the bartender shouldn't assume the tip amount, especially when the customer is possibly in a vulnerable state (drunk). The bartender's response was to refuse service, which is a strong reaction. \n\nNow, is the author wrong for not tipping? Well, if the bartender added the tip without asking, the customer isn't obligated to accept that. The author's choice to not tip could be seen as a protest against the bartender's unauthorized addition. However, in many places, the tip is supposed to be a voluntary gesture. If the bartender is part of a system that automatically adds tips, maybe that's part of their policy. But the customer should be informed. \n\nOn the other hand, the bartender's refusal to serve could be problematic. If the author is willing to pay the bill but just not tip, the bartender can't legally refuse service based on tip amounts. However, in some places, especially in bars or clubs, there might be different standards. But generally, the tip is part of the customer's discretion. \n\nSo, breaking it down: the bartender made a mistake by not informing the customer about the added tip. The customer's response, while perhaps confrontational, was a reaction to that mistake. The author isn't in the wrong for not tipping when they were not consulted. The bartender overstepped by adding the tip without permission and then refusing service. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
