      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that the author went to a club with friends, invited four friends for four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The author was drunk but not too drunk to notice. He then decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve him unless he tipped. The author feels he was in the right, but the question is whether he's actually at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, a standard tip is around 15-20% for service. Bartenders rely heavily on tips as part of their income. If the bartender added the tip automatically, that might be part of their standard practice. However, the author feels that the bartender was taking advantage of his state (being drunk) by adding the tip without permission. \n\nThe key points here are the bartender's actions in adding the tip without informing the customer and the author's response. The bartender's refusal to serve after the 0% tip could be seen as asserting their right to be tipped, but maybe the author had a right to object to the automatic tip. \n\nBut wait, in some establishments, especially nightclubs, automatic gratuities are common, especially for large parties or during certain hours. If the club had a policy of adding a service charge, the author might not have had a problem if informed. However, since the bartender did this without telling the author, maybe that's where the issue lies. \n\nHowever, even if the author was upset, refusing to tip at all could be seen as retaliatory. The author could have either paid the automatic tip or asked to remove it and then tipped appropriately. But the author chose to take offense and not tip, leading to a conflict. \n\nOn the other hand, the bartender's threat not to serve the author might have been inappropriate, but he's also within his rights to refuse service. So, the author's decision not to tip might not be right because it's customary to tip service staff, but the bartender's actions in adding the tip without notice might also be at fault.\n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author was in a position where he could have communicated his objection more effectively. Instead of tipping 0%, he could have discussed the issue with the bartender or manager. His response might have been an overreaction, especially considering the social norm of tipping. So, maybe the author is at fault for not handling the situation better, even if the bartender's initial action was questionable.\n"
