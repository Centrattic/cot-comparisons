      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, ordered drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The person got drunk but was still aware and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip. The person is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider tipping norms. In many places, especially in bars and restaurants, tipping is customary, often around 15-20%. However, the bartender here added the tip without the customer's knowledge. That's a bit odd because typically, the customer is expected to add the tip themselves. The bartender might have done this to ensure they got a tip, but it's unusual for a server to add their own tip without the customer's input. \n\nThe customer got drunk but wasn't too drunk to notice the added tip. They chose to tip 0% in response, which could be seen as a reaction to the bartender's action. The customer's reasoning is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who's drunk. However, the customer was still coherent enough to make that decision, so maybe they had the capacity to decide on a tip. \n\nThe bartender's response was to refuse service unless they tipped. That seems like an overreaction. Customers have the right to choose how much to tip, even if it's zero. The bartender can't force a tip or refuse service because of it. However, the customer's decision to tip zero despite the bartender's prior action might be seen as a breach of social norm, but not necessarily illegal or ethically wrong. \n\nSo, was the customer in the wrong? The key point is that the bartender added the tip without permission. The customer had the right to refuse, but the way they did it (0% after the bartender had already added 20%) might be seen as a conflict. However, the bartender's action of adding their own tip is not standard practice. Therefore, the customer might not be entirely in the wrong. They had the right to tip as they saw fit, especially after the bartender's unexpected action. The bartender's refusal to serve them is more concerning because servers can't force tips. \n\nIn conclusion, the customer might not be at fault here. They were reacting to the bartender's initial action, and while tipping is customary, it's not mandatory. The bartender overstepped by adding the tip without consent and then refusing service. So the answer would lean towards B (Not in the wrong).\n"
