      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in the scenario is at fault for not tipping the bartender. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The person was drunk but not so much that they didn't notice the bartender trying to put the tip in. They responded by tipping 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then threatened not to serve them if they didn't tip. The person is now wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's consider the usual tipping norms. In many places, especially in service industries like bars and restaurants, tipping is customary. Bartenders rely heavily on tips as part of their income. The person's argument is that the bartender added the tip without asking, which made them uncomfortable. They felt it was an attempt to take advantage of someone who was drunk. \n\nBut wait, the person was drunk. Even if they were, they still chose to respond by not tipping. The bartender might have had the option to add the tip as a default, which is sometimes done in some places, but maybe not others. If the bartender didn't communicate that they were adding a tip, it's possible the customer was surprised. However, the customer's response of 0% might be seen as overly harsh, especially if they were willing to tip an appropriate amount but just didn't like the way it was added.\n\nAnother angle: The bartender's threat to not serve them if they don't tip. That's also problematic because in some places, refusing service based on tipping could be an issue. But the customer's action of not tipping could also be seen as disrespectful to the bartender, who depends on tips for their livelihood. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, customary tipping is a social norm here. Even if the bartender didn't communicate the tip, the customer's response of zero might be seen as rude or inconsiderate. However, the bartender's action of adding the tip without notice could be seen as taking advantage. But the customer was drunk, which might affect their judgment. \n\nBut usually, the expectation is that you tip if you receive service, regardless of the bartender's actions. The author might have a point in feeling that the tip was added without consent, but the response of not tipping at all might be the bigger issue. They could have addressed the concern by discussing it and then still tipping an appropriate amount. \n\nSo considering all that, the author is in the wrong because they didn't tip at all, even though their reason was that the bartender was trying to take advantage. The appropriate action would have been to correct the tip amount if they were uncomfortable with the 20%, rather than not tipping. Hence, the answer is A.\n"
