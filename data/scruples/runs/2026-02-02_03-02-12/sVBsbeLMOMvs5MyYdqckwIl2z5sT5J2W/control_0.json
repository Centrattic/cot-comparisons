      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the bartender is in the wrong. Let me go through the situation again.\n\nSo, the person went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The person was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They responded by tipping 0%, saying the bartender shouldn't take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip. The person wanted to tip appropriately but was upset about the bartender adding 20% without permission.\n\nHmm. Tipping customs can vary by culture, but in many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected and sometimes even automatic. The bartender might have added the tip as a default, maybe because the customer was drunk and they wanted to avoid a situation where the customer forgot or tried to shortchange. But the customer might feel that the bartender was overreaching by not asking. \n\nOn one hand, the bartender might be doing their job by ensuring they get a fair tip, especially if the customer is impaired. On the other hand, the customer has the right to decide how much to tip, even if they're drunk. However, not tipping at all could be seen as unacceptable, especially if the service was good. The customer's reaction might be justified if the bartender added a tip without consent, but refusing to tip entirely could be considered rude or inconsiderate. \n\nThe bartender threatening not to serve them if they didn't tip is also a problem because it's not up to the bartender to enforce tipping. However, the customer's refusal to tip at all might have been the catalyst for that response. So, maybe the customer is at fault for not tipping, even if they had an issue with the automatic tip. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn some cases, if a customer is clearly impaired, the server might have a duty to prevent them from making a poor decision, like not tipping. But the customer's right to choose the tip amount is also important. The key here is whether the customer's response was appropriate. If the customer was upset about the automatic tip, they could have communicated that politely instead of tipping 0%. But since they were drunk, maybe they acted impulsively. \n\nI think the customer is partially at fault because not tipping is generally considered rude, even if they had a reason. The bartender might have been in the wrong for adding the tip without permission, but the customer's refusal to tip at all could be seen as their own mistake. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
