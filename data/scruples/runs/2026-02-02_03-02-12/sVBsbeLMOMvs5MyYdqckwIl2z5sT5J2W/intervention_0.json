      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender after the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. \n\nFirst, the situation: They went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added 20% tip without mentioning it. The author was drunk but noticed this and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The author thought they weren't in the wrong, but wants to know if they are.\n\nSo, the main points here are about tipping etiquette and the bartender's actions. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected as part of service, and sometimes the establishment adds a gratuity automatically. However, the bartender here added a 20% tip without informing the customer, which the author found manipulative. \n\nBut wait, usually when a tip is added automatically, it's up to the customer to accept it or not. However, if the bartender did this without the customer's knowledge, that might be against standard practice. Some places require that automatic gratuities be disclosed to the customer before the transaction. If the bartender didn't do that, maybe he's violating some policy. \n\nThe author's response was to tip 0%, which could be seen as a protest against the bartender's action. However, the author was drunk but still made the choice, so intent matters here. The bartender's refusal to serve could be a problem too. In some places, employees can't deny service based on tipping, but I'm not sure about the exact laws there. \n\nIf the bartender added the tip without permission, the author isn't at fault for not going along with it. However, in many service industries, not tipping at all is frowned upon, especially if the service was good. But the key here is the bartender's action. If he was supposed to get a tip and the author's refusal was due to the tip being added without consent, then the author's stance might be justified. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the establishment's policy allows for automatic tipping and the bartender followed it, then the author might be wrong for refusing. But if the bartender acted outside of policy by not informing the customer, the author is justified. \n\nAlso, the author's statement about the bartender taking advantage of them being drunk could be a sensitive issue. The bartender's response of refusing service was perhaps unprofessional. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author's actions stem from the bartender's failure to communicate the tip addition. If the bartender didn't have the right to add the tip without permission, the author isn't at fault. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
