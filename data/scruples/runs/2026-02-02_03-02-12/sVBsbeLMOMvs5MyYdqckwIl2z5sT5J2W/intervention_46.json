Now I was pretty drunk, but not enough to not notice him trying to put the tip percentage on his own. I responded by tipping him 0% telling him to not take advantage of people who are drunk. He responded by saying that he won't serve me anymore if I don't tip him. I was willing to tip an appropriate amount myself, but him just putting in a 20% tip without telling me rubbed me the wrong way.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did the right thing by not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, bought them drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The author, feeling that the bartender was taking advantage because they were drunk, decided to tip 0% and told him not to do that. The bartender then threatened not to serve them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary in service industries like bartending. The expectation is usually around 15-20%, but it's supposed to be left by the customer. If the bartender added the tip without permission, that's a problem because it's not the customer's choice. The author might feel it's a violation of their autonomy to have the tip decided for them, especially when they were under the influence. But being drunk doesn't excuse not tipping, because tipping is a social norm regardless of sobriety.\n\nHowever, the key point here is that the bartender didn't ask before adding the tip. That's a breach of the customer's control over their payment. So the author's reaction could be justified as standing up against an unapproved addition. But then, the author chose to tip 0%, which is going against the norm. The bartender's threat to not serve them is his prerogative, but he can't force someone to pay a tip. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the bartender added the tip without permission, the author has a right to remove it. But if the author intentionally refused to tip after that, maybe they're not wrong, since the initial tip was unauthorized. The author's argument is about the bartender's action, not their own sobriety. The bartender's response was aggressive, but the author's action was in response to the unauthorized tip. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without permission. The author's choice to not tip after that was a reaction to the bartender's action, not just being drunk. So the answer would be B.\n"
