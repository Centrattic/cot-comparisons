      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The scenario is that they went to a club with friends, invited four people for drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The person was drunk but not too drunk to notice, and they decided to give 0% tip, which led to the bartender refusing to serve them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Tipping culture varies, but in many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected as part of service industry wages. However, if the bartender added the tip without consulting the customer, that's a problem. The customer might feel that the bartender was taking advantage of their inebriated state. But then the customer's response was to give 0%, which could be seen as a rejection of the automatic tip. The bartender's threat to not serve them further complicates things.\n\nThe person's reasoning is that the bartender shouldn't assume the tip amount, especially when customers are drunk. They wanted to decide the appropriate amount themselves. On the other hand, the bartender might have a policy to add a service charge, which could be standard in some establishments. If the club had a policy of adding a service fee, the customer should have been informed. However, since the bartender did it without telling, the customer felt disrespected.\n\nIn terms of etiquette, some places do add a service charge automatically, especially for groups or events. If this was a private event or a large group, that might be the case. But if it's a regular customer just paying, then the bartender shouldn't impose a tip without asking. The customer's reaction, while confrontational, might be justified if the tip was added without their knowledge. However, not tipping at all, even if the customer was upset, could still be seen as inconsiderate, depending on the establishment's policies.\n\nThe key points are: the bartender added a tip without informing, the customer was drunk but aware, and the customer refused to tip. The bartender then refused service. The question is whether the customer was in the wrong. If the restaurant doesn't have a policy of adding tips and the bartender did it on their own, then the customer's refusal might be understandable. But if the establishment has a service charge policy, the customer should have been informed. Since the customer was paying for multiple friends, maybe the bartender thought it was a group event with a service fee. But without clear communication, the bartender's action could be at fault. The customer's response might be justified in that case. However, refusing to tip entirely could still be seen as inconsiderate, even if the tip was added without permission. Alternatively, the customer could have pointed out the added tip and decided on an appropriate amount themselves.\n\nIn many places, tips are meant to be discretionary. If the bartender added 20%, the customer might have expected to tip less or adjust based on service. But the customer chose to tip 0%, which is extreme. The bartender's threat to not serve is also problematic. So, the situation is a bit of a gray area. The customer's action might be a reaction to the bartender's mistake, but not tipping at all could still be seen as rude. However, if the customer was asserting their right to decide the tip amount, maybe they are not at fault. It depends on whether the service charge was part of the establishment's policy. If it was, the bartender should have informed the customer. If not, then the customer's refusal is understandable. Since the user says the author is not in the wrong, I need to decide based on the information given. The answer would likely be B (No), because the bartender added the tip without permission, and the customer was within their right to refuse, though the approach might have been harsh. The bartender's response was also inappropriate. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
