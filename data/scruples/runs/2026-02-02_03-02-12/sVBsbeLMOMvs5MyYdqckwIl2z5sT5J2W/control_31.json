      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip their bartender is at fault. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, bought four drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The person was drunk but noticed and decided to tip 0%, which led to the bartender refusing to serve them anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the usual tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, a standard tip is around 15-20%, especially in service industries like restaurants or bars. However, the bartender here added the tip without asking, which is a bit different. Normally, the tip is left at the customer's discretion, so if the bartender assumed they would tip without checking, that's unusual.\n\nThe person was drunk but not too impaired to notice the bartender's action. They felt the bartender was taking advantage, which is why they decided not to tip. The bartender then refused to serve them. \n\nNow, is the person in the wrong? Well, if the standard expectation is to tip, then not tipping could be seen as wrong. But the twist here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. That might be a breach of the norm. Usually, the customer decides the tip amount. The bartender's action could be seen as overstepping, leading the customer to feel pressured. \n\nThe person's response was to tip 0%, which is a reaction to the bartender's action. If the bartender had asked, maybe the person would have tipped an appropriate amount. But since the bartender didn't ask and just added it, the person's reaction might be justified. However, by not tipping at all, they caused a conflict. \n\nBut in many cases, even if the service is bad, not tipping is considered rude. However, if the service is good and the tip is just a matter of policy, maybe the customer is expected to follow it. But in this case, the bartender's action was the issue. The person might have felt disrespected by the bartender's assumption. \n\nSo, is the person wrong? If the bartender's action was unprofessional, then maybe the person isn't entirely at fault. But the refusal to tip at all could be seen as wrong. However, the bartender's refusal to serve them if they didn't tip could also be problematic, as they can't deny service for that reason. \n\nIn conclusion, the bartender's actions might have been the initial issue, but the customer's response could be seen as a justified reaction to being taken advantage of. So the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
