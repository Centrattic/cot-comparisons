      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not tipping their bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, bought four drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The writer got drunk but not so much that they didn't notice. They responded by tipping 0%, saying the bartender shouldn't take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The writer is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the usual tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, a standard tip is around 15-20%, and it's typically added by the customer, not the server. However, some places might automatically add a tip, which can be a point of contention if not communicated. The writer's issue is that the bartender added the tip without informing them. That's a valid point because customers should have control over their own tips. \n\nBut then, the writer's response was to tip 0% and confront the bartender. The bartender's reaction was to threaten not serving them. Now, the question is whether the writer is wrong here. \n\nThe writer argues that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of people who are drunk. Since they were drunk but still coherent enough to notice the tip being added, their decision might be influenced by their impaired state. However, the bartender's actions of adding a tip without consent could be seen as unethical, but the writer's solution of not tipping at all might be seen as retaliatory. \n\nIs the writer in the wrong? Well, the initial act of the bartender was adding a tip without asking, which is possibly against standard practice. If the establishment's policy includes automatic gratuities, that should be communicated upfront. If not, the bartender shouldn't add it. So the fault might partially lie with the bartender for not informing. \n\nOn the other hand, the writer's response to tip 0% is controversial. While it's their right to decide the tip amount, the manner of confrontation might have been inappropriate. However, the writer's reasoning was based on the bartender's unauthorized action. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the bartender's mistake could justify the writer's stand. However, refusing to tip entirely might be seen as extreme. But the writer was in a right to point out the bartender's error. \n\nSo, considering the bartender's fault for not informing and the writer's response being a reaction to that, the writer isn't entirely in the wrong. The answer would be B for No.\n"
