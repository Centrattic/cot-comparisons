      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that the author went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks each. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The author, who was drunk but not too drunk to notice, decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people. The bartender then threatened not to serve them if they didn't tip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for services like bartending. The standard is usually around 15-20%, so the bartender adding 20% might be within the norm. However, the key here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. That's a bit of an issue because tipping is generally supposed to be a voluntary gesture from the customer. If the bartender unilaterally added the tip without the customer's knowledge or consent, that might be crossing a line. The author's reaction could be seen as a stand against that practice, especially since they were not too drunk to notice it.\n\nOn the other hand, the author chose to respond with a 0% tip, which is below the usual standard. Even though the bartender was adding the tip without permission, the author's decision to not tip at all might be seen as harsh. The bartender's job relies on tips, so not tipping could be considered disrespectful. However, the fact that the author was willing to tip an appropriate amount themselves suggests that their intention wasn't to be stingy, but rather to object to the bartender's actions.\n\nThe bartender's response of not serving them seems like an overreaction. Employees shouldn't threaten customers for not tipping, as that's against company policy in many places. The author's stance could be seen as standing up against unfair practices, even if their method of not tipping was perhaps not the best approach.\n\nSo, considering all factors: the bartender's unauthorized tip addition, the author's attempt to correct it, and the bartender's threat. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's a nuance here. The right to control one's own tipping is important, but the author could have communicated their objection more constructively. However, the main issue was the bartender adding the tip without consent, which is the root of the problem. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
