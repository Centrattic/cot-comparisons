      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not tipping the bartender after he added a 20% tip without their knowledge. So, first, I need to consider the context.\n\nWhen they went to the club, they invited four friends for four drinks. That part is a bit unclear, maybe they bought four rounds of drinks for their group? But the key point is the tipping part. The bartender added a 20% tip automatically. The user noticed and decided to tip 0%, which led to the bartender threatening not to serve them anymore.\n\nNow, standard tipping practices in the US are usually around 15-20%, especially in places like bars or restaurants where the service staff rely on tips. But here, the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. That's a bit unusual. Normally, the customer decides the tip amount, and the server shouldn't add it without consent. However, some places might add a service charge, but that's usually a different scenario.\n\nThe user was drunk but not too drunk to notice the bartender putting in the tip. They felt the bartender was taking advantage and refused to tip. The bartender then refused to serve them. \n\nSo, the question is, who's at fault? The user might argue that the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without their knowledge, making them feel pressured. On the other hand, the bartender might see the customer's refusal as rude or inconsiderate, especially since tipping is customary.\n\nIn many cases, not tipping at all is seen as disrespectful, especially if you're a regular or if the service was good. However, the bartender's action of adding the tip without asking could be seen as manipulative. But when the customer refused to tip, the bartender's response of refusing service might be extreme, especially in a club setting where there's less of a relationship between customer and server compared to a restaurant.\n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. If the user had tipped a lower amount but not zero, maybe the situation would be different. But since they tipped 0%, that's a strong reaction. However, the bartender also initiated the conflict by adding the tip without consent. So, maybe the fault isn't entirely on one side. But the user's choice to leave zero tip after the bartender's action could be seen as inconsiderate, even if the bartender's action was questionable. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the user's response was appropriate. While the bartender shouldn't have added the tip unilaterally, the user's refusal to tip at all might be too harsh. However, the bartender's response of refusing service was also inappropriate. But the user's initial action of not tipping might be more in the wrong because of the social expectation around tipping. So, perhaps the answer is A, the user is in the wrong. But I'm a bit conflicted. Maybe the answer is B, because the bartender shouldn't have added the tip. Hmm.\n"
