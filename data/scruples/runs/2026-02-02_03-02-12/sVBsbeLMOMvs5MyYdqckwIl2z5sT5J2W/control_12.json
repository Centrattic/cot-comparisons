      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the bartender is in the wrong. Here's the situation: they went to a club with friends, invited four friends for four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The person got drunk but noticed the bartender adding the tip and then decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip. The user is asking if they're at fault.\n\nSo, first, I need to think about tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected in restaurants and bars. Bartenders often rely on tips as a significant part of their income. So, if a customer doesn't tip, that's usually considered rude or inappropriate. However, the twist here is that the bartender added a tip without informing the customer. That might have been an issue because the customer expected to decide on the tip amount themselves. \n\nThe user was drunk but not too drunk to notice the bartender adding the tip. They responded by not tipping and told the bartender not to take advantage. The bartender then refused to serve them. Now, the question is whether the user is at fault. \n\nOn one hand, the bartender added a tip without consent, which might be against the customer's wishes. On the other hand, the user's response was to not tip, which could be seen as taking the bartender down a notch. But in terms of social norms, not tipping at all is generally frowned upon, regardless of the reason. \n\nBut there's a nuance here. The bartender might have a policy of adding a service charge, which is common in some places. If the bartender didn't explain that, it's their fault. However, if the user knew this was a common practice and still refused, perhaps that's their issue. But the user didn't know, and the bartender didn't inform them. So, maybe the user had a legitimate reason to be upset. \n\nHowever, the user's action of not tipping and confronting the bartender could be considered rude. Even if the bartender made a mistake, the user's response was to withhold a tip, which is a common way to express dissatisfaction, but in a service industry, that's not typically how it's handled. The customer could have asked to remove the added tip instead of leaving zero. \n\nSo, considering all this, the user might have a point about the bartender not informing them, but their action of not tipping is problematic. However, the bartender's refusal to serve because of a tip might also be an overreaction. But in terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the user's main mistake was not tipping, which is against the norm. So maybe the answer is A (Yes, the user is in the wrong). But I'm a bit conflicted because the bartender's action was also questionable. But the user's response was to not tip, which is the standard AITA scenario where not tipping is considered wrong. So I think the answer is A.\n"
