      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends for four drinks each. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The author was drunk but noticed this and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the usual etiquette around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for services like bartending. The standard is usually 15-20%, but it's not mandatory. However, some places might automatically add a tip, especially in establishments where tipping is a significant part of the server's income.\n\nThe author says they were willing to tip an appropriate amount themselves but were annoyed that the bartender added 20% without permission. The key here is whether the bartender had the right to do that. If the establishment has a policy of adding a service charge, then maybe it's acceptable. But if the bartender added the tip on their own without informing the customer, that might be an issue. The author might feel that it's not their responsibility to pay an unapproved tip, especially when they were already providing drinks for friends.\n\nThe author's response was to tip 0%, which is a strong reaction. They were drunk, which might affect their judgment, but they claim they weren't too drunk to notice the tip. The bartender then refused service, which could be against the law in some places\u2014if someone is refused service because they don't tip, that might be illegal as tipping is supposed to be voluntary. However, some places allow businesses to have tipping policies, and if the bartender is part of that policy, maybe it's within their rights.\n\nThe question is about whether the author was in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, if the bartender didn't inform them that a tip was automatically added, maybe the author had a right to refuse. But in terms of social norms, not tipping could be seen as rude, regardless of the bartender's actions. However, the bartender's action of adding the tip without consent might be the root of the issue here. \n\nSo, considering that the author was responding to an unauthorized tip, their reaction might be justified. The bartender shouldn't have added the tip without consent, and the author was asserting their right to decide their own tipping. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong. But some might argue that the author should have tipped regardless. However, since the tip was added without their knowledge, the author's refusal could be seen as a stand against unfair practices. \n\nI think the answer here is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
