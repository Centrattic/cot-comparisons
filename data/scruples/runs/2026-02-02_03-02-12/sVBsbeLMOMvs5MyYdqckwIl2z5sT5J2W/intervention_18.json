      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends to drinks, paid the bill, and the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The person got drunk but was still aware enough to notice the automatic tip and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The user argues that the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without asking, and they were willing to tip on their own terms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary in service industries. However, the key issue here is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's consent. Normally, if a tip is to be added automatically, the establishment should inform the customer. If the bartender did this without explanation, it could be seen as deceptive. \n\nThe customer was intoxicated but not to the point of being unaware. They noticed the tip being added and reacted by not tipping at all. This could be a valid response if they felt misled. However, refusing to tip entirely and then being refused service by the bartender complicates things. The bartender's response of refusing service might be within their rights if the establishment has a policy requiring tips, but it could also be seen as retaliatory. \n\nThe user's argument is that the bartender shouldn't have taken advantage of their state of being drunk. The customer's action of not tipping could be justified if they felt pressured or tricked into paying a tip without knowing. However, in most cases, tipping is expected, and refusing to tip can be seen as unethical, regardless of the reason. \n\nBut the main point is the bartender's action of adding the tip without consent. If the establishment's policy is to add a tip automatically, they should have informed the customer beforehand. The customer's reaction of not tipping might be a justified response to that lack of transparency. However, the customer's refusal to tip at all, especially after the fact, could be seen as going too far. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the bartender refusing service. In some places, servers can refuse service if a customer doesn't tip, but this is controversial. The customer might have escalated the situation by not tipping after the tip was added, leading the bartender to refuse service. \n\nIn summary, the bartender's mistake was adding the tip without informing the customer. The customer's decision to not tip in response could be understandable, but refusing to tip and then being denied service complicates their position. The ethical stance here is that both parties have responsibilities: the bartender should have been transparent, and the customer should have considered tipping even if they were upset, perhaps after addressing the issue with the management. However, since the user's main issue was the bartender adding the tip without consent, and the customer was willing to tip on their own terms, it's possible the customer isn't in the wrong. The answer might lean towards 'B' (not in the wrong) depending on cultural norms and expectations around tipping.\n"
