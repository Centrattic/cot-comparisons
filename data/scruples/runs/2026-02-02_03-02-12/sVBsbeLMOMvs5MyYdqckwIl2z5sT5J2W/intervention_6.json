      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The scenario is that they went to a club with friends, bought them drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The author, who was drunk but not too drunk, decided to tip 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage of people. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The main issue is the tip being added without consent. In many places, especially in the service industry, tips are supposed to be discretionary. If the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge, that could be a problem because the customer should have the choice to tip or not, and the amount. The author felt wronged by this action and responded by not tipping at all. \n\nBut wait, is it common for bartenders to add tips automatically? In some regions, especially in places where service charges are high, maybe that's the norm. However, in other places, adding a tip without the customer's consent might be considered deceptive. The author's response was to tip 0%, which could be seen as a protest against the bartender's action. However, the bartender then threatened not to serve them if they didn't tip. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The possible arguments are: \n\n1. The author didn't tip at all, which could be seen as rude or inconsiderate, especially if the bartender was following local tipping practices. \n\n2. The bartender might have had a policy of adding tips, and the author's refusal could be disrespectful. \n\n3. On the other hand, the bartender didn't inform the customer about the tip, which could be a breach of etiquette or transparency. \n\nSo, in terms of responsibility, the bartender might have made a mistake by adding the tip without permission. The author's response was to not tip, which could be justified if they felt the bartender was being deceptive. However, the author could have handled it differently, like asking the bartender why the tip was added and then deciding whether to pay it. \n\nBut in the situation, the author was drunk. That might affect their judgment. However, even if drunk, the action of not tipping is still a choice. The bartender's threat to not serve them if they don't tip is also questionable because the customer has the right to choose whether to tip or not. The bartender can refuse service, but that's a bit of a power imbalance.\n\nIn many places, the law allows for tips to be a customer's choice. If the bartender added it without asking, the customer isn't obligated to pay it. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong because they were responding to an action they considered inappropriate. The bartender's action of adding the tip without consent could be the main issue here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no other angle. For example, if the establishment had a policy of adding a gratuity for large groups or events, maybe the author should have been aware. But the situation mentions a club with friends, and the author was invited to buy drinks for four friends. The bartender added a tip without telling them, so unless there's a known policy, the author might not be expected to know. \n\nSo, the key points are: \n\n- Bartender's action of adding tip without informing the customer. \n\n- Author's response as a protest. \n\n- Bartender's refusal to serve as a consequence. \n\nIn this case, the author's right to choose how much to tip is important. The bartender shouldn't assume the tip and then retaliate by refusing service. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
