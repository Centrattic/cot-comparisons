      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that the author and friends went to a club, the author invited four friends for four drinks each. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing the author. The author, who was drunk but not too drunk to notice, then decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender responded by refusing to serve them unless they tipped. The author is now wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is a common practice where customers add a percentage to their bill as a service charge, which goes to the server. Bartenders, like other service workers, often rely on tips as a significant part of their income. So, usually, the expectation is that you tip, typically around 15-20%.\n\nBut in this case, the bartender added the tip themselves without asking. That's a bit unusual. Normally, the customer decides the tip amount, and the bartender shouldn't be putting in a tip on their own. That might have been a mistake by the bartender, perhaps misunderstanding the situation, or maybe trying to be helpful but overstepping.\n\nThe author was drunk but not to the point of not noticing. So they saw the bartender adding the tip and decided to counter by not tipping. The reasoning here is that the author felt the bartender was taking advantage by automatically adding a tip without permission. However, the author's response was to tip 0%, which could be seen as retaliatory. But was that justified?\n\nThe key points here are the bartender's actions and the author's response. If the bartender's job is to process the payment, they might not have the authority to add a tip without the customer's knowledge. That could be a procedural error. The author, upon noticing this, might have felt that the bartender was trying to collect a tip they weren't entitled to, possibly due to the customer being drunk and vulnerable.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's decision to tip 0% could be seen as a deliberate act of defiance, which might be seen as inconsiderate. Even if the bartender made a mistake, the author's response might have been harsh. However, the bartender also escalated the situation by threatening not to serve them, which could be an overreaction. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, typically, customers are expected to tip, but in this case, the bartender's action of adding the tip without permission complicates things. The author's response might be a valid reaction to a service error. However, the act of not tipping, especially in a place where tipping is standard, could be seen as inconsiderate. But if the bartender shouldn't have added the tip in the first place, the author's action might be justified.\n\nAnother angle: the author invited friends, so maybe the total bill was higher. If the author considered the drinks as a gesture, perhaps the expectation of a tip was different. But even then, service workers usually expect tips regardless of the reason for the transaction.\n\nIn terms of etiquette, the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without consent. The author's response was to not tip, which might be seen as a way to correct the bartender's mistake. However, the threat from the bartender to refuse service was also problematic. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be in the wrong because the bartender made an error, and the author acted in response to that. But there's a nuance here. If the author is in a culture where tipping is expected, not tipping could be seen as rude regardless. However, the specific act of the bartender adding the tip without permission is a complicating factor. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (B), because the bartender's actions were inappropriate, and the author's response was a reaction to that. However, the author could have communicated better, perhaps by asking for the tip to be removed instead of setting it to 0. But the core issue is the bartender's unauthorized addition of the tip.\n"
