      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender.\n\nSo the scenario is they went to a club with friends, invited four people for four drinks. When paying, the bartender added 20% tip without telling them. The author, who was a bit drunk, noticed and then decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The author says they were willing to tip appropriately but the bartender adding the tip without consent upset them. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the usual tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for good service, around 15-20%. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. Normally, the customer has control over the tip amount. If the bartender unilaterally added it, that might be an issue. The customer might feel it's their choice to tip, not the server's. So the author's reaction is about being taken advantage of, which could be a valid concern.\n\nBut then, the author decided to tip 0%, which is against the norm. Even if the bartender shouldn't have added the tip, not tipping at all might be seen as a poor response. The author was drunk, which could affect their judgment. However, even if drunk, they might still be expected to act within social norms. The bartender then refused service because of the 0% tip, which could be a problem if the customer is at the point of paying and the bartender is enforcing a policy that wasn't clear beforehand.\n\nAnother angle: inviting friends to drinks might imply splitting the bill, but the situation doesn't specify if that was the case. The author might have paid the whole amount, expecting to tip themselves. The bartender adding the tip without permission could be a breach of trust, especially if the customer didn't agree to that. The author's response, while extreme, is a reaction to the bartender's actions. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If the bartender added the tip without consent, that's on the bartender. The author's decision not to tip could be a justified reaction to that, but not tipping at all is still against social expectations. However, the author might not be wrong if the bartender's action was the initial problem. So the responsibility might be shared, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer here is B (not in the wrong) because the bartender's action of unilaterally adding a tip was the main issue. The author's response, while not ideal, was a reaction to being taken advantage of. The bartender shouldn't have added the tip without consent, so the author isn't entirely at fault.\n"
