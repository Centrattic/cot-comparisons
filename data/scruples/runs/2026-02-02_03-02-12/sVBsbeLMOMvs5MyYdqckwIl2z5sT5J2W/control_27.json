      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is they went to a club with friends, bought drinks for four people. The bartender added a 20% tip without asking, and the author was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They responded by not tipping at all, leading the bartender to refuse service unless they did tip. The author claims they wanted to tip an appropriate amount but were upset the bartender assumed control.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the usual tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary and often expected for services like bartending. However, the key here is that the bartender added the tip automatically without informing the customer. Normally, tips are supposed to be an optional gesture, though in practice, not tipping can lead to poor service or confrontations.\n\nThe author's defense is that they were willing to tip but didn't want the bartender to assume. However, by not tipping, they might have violated the unwritten norm, even if the bartender acted improperly. The bartender's response of refusing service if they didn't tip could be seen as a strong reaction, but in the service industry, some might argue that expecting a tip is part of their income, and not tipping is disrespectful.\n\nBut the author's argument is that the bartender shouldn't have preselected the tip without asking. Some might side with the author here because the customer should have the choice to tip or not, and the bartender overstepped by not getting consent. However, others would say that in some establishments, a service charge is included, so maybe the bartender was following policy. But the author didn't know that and acted on it.\n\nThe drunk factor: the author was drunk but claims they weren't too impaired to notice the tip being added. So, maybe responsibility isn't waived by intoxication. Still, their judgment might have been clouded, but that's not an excuse if they made a deliberate choice.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's action of not tipping after a preselected tip might be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the bartender was acting on standard practice. However, the bartender's approach of adding the tip without consent could be at fault. Depending on the context, the author might be in the wrong for not tipping, even if they were upset, because the customary expectation is to tip for good service. Alternatively, if the bartender shouldn't have forced the issue, the author might not be entirely at fault. But typically, in such scenarios, not tipping is seen as the customer's error unless there was poor service.\n"
