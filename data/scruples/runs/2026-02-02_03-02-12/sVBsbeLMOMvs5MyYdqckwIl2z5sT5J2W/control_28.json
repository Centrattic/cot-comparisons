      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that the author went to a club with friends, invited 4 friends to 4 drinks each. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling the author. The author was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They decided to tip 0%, saying the bartender shouldn't take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then refused to serve them, saying they had to tip. The author wanted to tip but thought the bartender shouldn't have added it without consent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider etiquette around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected for service workers. Bartenders rely on tips as part of their income. However, adding a tip automatically without informing the customer might be an issue. Normally, when you pay, the system might allow you to add a tip, but the bartender shouldn't be manually changing it. If the bartender added the tip without asking, that's a problem. The customer has the right to decide their tip amount.\n\nThe author was intoxicated but still made a conscious decision not to tip. The bartender's response of refusing service if they don't tip is another point. Refusing service over a tip might be within the bartender's rights, but in some places, they can't withhold service based on that. However, if the customer is being abusive or threatening, that's different. Here, the author was upset about the automatic tip and tried to correct it. \n\nSo, the key points: 1) Did the bartender have the right to add a tip without permission? 2) Was the author justified in not tipping? 3) Did the bartender overstep by refusing service?\n\nIn terms of etiquette, the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without the customer's knowledge. The customer has the right to adjust the tip. The author's decision to leave 0% as a form of protest might be seen as a reaction to the bartender's actions. However, not tipping at all is generally considered poor etiquette. The author's reasoning is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of a drunk customer, but that's a bit of an assumption unless the bartender was actively trying to deceive. If the author was drunk, maybe they shouldn't have been handling payment, but they were still in a position to choose their tip.\n\nThe bartender's response of refusing service if they don't tip is problematic because it's not the customer's fault the tip was added. However, if the bartender felt the author was being disrespectful, they might have the right to refuse service. \n\nOverall, the author might be at fault for not tipping at all, but the bartender also acted inappropriately by adding the tip without permission. However, in terms of the question, the focus is on the author's actions. Since the author chose not to tip in a situation where tipping is expected, they might be in the wrong unless the bartender acted unethically. But the bartender did add the tip without consent, which complicates it. So maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong because the bartender shouldn't have done that. But some might argue the author should tip regardless. It's a bit of a gray area, but the key is the bartender's unauthorized action.\n"
