      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The person was drunk but noticed this and tipped 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of a drunk person. The bartender then said he won't serve them if they don't tip. The person says they wanted to tip appropriately but the bartender adding 20% without consent made them upset.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the etiquette around tipping. Typically, in places like bars, especially in the service industry, tipping is expected as it's part of the servers' income. Bartenders often rely on tips because their wages might be low. However, the act of the bartender adding a tip without informing the customer might be problematic. Some places automatically add a service charge, which is different from a tip. Tips are usually left at the customer's discretion, whereas a service charge is a mandatory fee that goes to the employee. If the bartender just increased the tip percentage himself without the customer's knowledge, that could be seen as deceptive. \n\nThe customer was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They reacted by not tipping, which the bartender responded to by refusing service. The key points here are: was the bartender allowed to add the tip without permission? Did the customer have the right to refuse? If the establishment has a policy of adding a service charge, that's different. But if the bartender did it on his own, that's an issue. Also, when the customer refused to tip, the bartender refused to serve. That could be a violation of the customer's rights, as a server can't legally refuse service unless they have grounds, like the customer being disruptive or violating the establishment's rules. \n\nEthically, the customer's action of not tipping in response to the bartender's unauthorized addition of the tip might be justified. However, the refusal to tip at all could be seen as inconsiderate. The customer might have wanted to tip a smaller amount but was offended by the automatic 20%. It's possible that the customer's reaction was a bit harsh, but the bartender's action of adding the tip without consent could be the root issue here. \n\nIn terms of legalities, in many places, a server can't force a customer to tip. However, adding a tip without the customer's knowledge might not be legal either. Some states require that an automatic gratuity be declared on the bill. If the bartender added it without that, it's a problem. The customer's right to refuse service is another factor. If the bartender refused service because of the tip, that could be an issue. \n\nSo, the customer might not be in the wrong if the bartender's actions were unethical or illegal. However, if the customer's reaction of not tipping is seen as a violation of social norms, even if the bartender was wrong, the customer could still be considered at fault. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer might depend on the specific context and local laws, but generally, if the customer was responding to an unauthorized tip, they might not be in the wrong. The bartender's response of refusing service could be the bigger issue. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
