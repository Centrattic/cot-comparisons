      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, paid for four drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The author was drunk but not too drunk to notice, so they decided to tip 0% in response, which led the bartender to refuse service. The author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected as part of the service industry's income. Bartenders rely on tips for a significant portion of their earnings. However, the key point here is that the bartender added a 20% tip without the customer's knowledge. Normally, tips are added at the customer's discretion. If the bartender unilaterally added the tip without informing the customer, that might be seen as inappropriate. The customer's reaction of refusing to tip could be a direct response to that action.\n\nBut the customer was drunk. That might affect their judgment. However, the user mentioned they weren't too drunk to notice the bartender's action. So, even if they were under the influence, they understood what was happening. The customer's argument is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of a drunk person by adding a tip without consent. The bartender's response was to refuse service if they don't tip, which seems like a strong reaction. \n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The bartender's action of adding a tip without permission could be seen as a breach of trust. The customer felt disrespected and decided to withhold the tip as a form of protest. The bartender's refusal to serve is a bit harsh, as the customer was willing to tip an appropriate amount but was upset by the initial unauthorized addition. \n\nHowever, in typical service industry practices, if a customer refuses to tip, the establishment can refuse service. But in this case, the customer's refusal was in response to the bartender's action. It's a bit of a conflict of expectations. The customer might not be in the wrong because they felt wronged by the bartender's unilateral decision. The bartender, on the other hand, might have overstepped by adding the tip without consent and then refusing service. \n\nAnother angle: some places have automatic gratuities for groups or during certain hours. If that's standard at the club, maybe the customer should have been informed beforehand. If it's not standard, then the bartender did something unexpected, which the customer reacted to. \n\nIn conclusion, the customer's reaction is a direct response to the bartender's action. While tipping is customary, the bartender's method here was questionable. The customer isn't necessarily in the wrong for standing up for themselves, even if it means not tipping. The bartender's refusal to serve might be their right, but the situation is more nuanced. So, the answer is likely B (No).\n"
