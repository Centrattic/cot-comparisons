      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not tipping their bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four people to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The author was drunk but noticed this and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. Let's break it down. Tipping is a cultural norm in many places, especially in service industries like bartending. The standard is usually 15-20%, but it's supposed to be the customer's choice, right? However, some places automatically add a gratuity, which is common in some contexts, like restaurants for large groups or in certain service industries. But the key here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. That might be an issue because the customer wasn't given a choice. If the establishment has a policy of automatically adding a tip, they should inform the customer. But if the bartender did it on his own, maybe against the policy, that's different.\n\nThe author was drunk but not too drunk to notice. So they made a conscious decision to not tip. They felt the bartender was taking advantage of their state. The bartender then refused service if they didn't tip. Now, in some places, refusing service is allowed if the customer is being disruptive or refusing to pay a tip, but in others, it's not. But the main question is about being in the wrong ethically, not legally.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, the bartender added the tip without consultation, which felt like an overreach. The author's response was to not tip and confront the bartender. The bartender then threatened to refuse service. The author's reasoning is that the bartender shouldn't assume the tip amount without the customer's consent, especially when the customer is impaired.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge, that's a problem. The customer has the right to decide their tip amount. But the author chose to tip 0% after that, which might be seen as a negative response. However, the bartender's action could be seen as manipulative. If the bartender added the tip to make up for the author's potential low tip because they were drunk, that's different. But if it's just adding a tip without permission, that's not fair.\n\nIn some contexts, automatic gratuity is standard, but the key is transparency. If the bartender didn't inform the customer, maybe the customer is justified in their reaction. However, the author could have just paid the 20% and left, but instead chose to zero out the tip, which might be seen as petty. But the bartender's refusal to serve is also extreme. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong because the bartender made the mistake of adding the tip without consent. The author's response, while maybe not the best way to handle it, is a reaction to an initial action by the bartender. Therefore, the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
