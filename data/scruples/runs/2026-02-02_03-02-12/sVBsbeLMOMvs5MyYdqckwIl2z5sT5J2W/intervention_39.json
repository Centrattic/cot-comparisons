      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that the author went to a club with friends, bought four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The author was drunk but not too much to notice this. They then decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender responded by saying he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip. The author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, tipping is customary for services like bartending, often 15-20%. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without asking the customer. Normally, when you pay with a card, the system might allow you to add a tip, but the server shouldn't assume the customer wants to tip unless it's standard practice. So, if the bartender added 20% on their own without the customer's consent, that's problematic. The customer has the right to choose how much to tip, if any.\n\nThe author was drunk but still noticed the bartender's action. They responded by not tipping, which is their right. The bartender then refused service, which could be a policy of the establishment, but the act of the bartender adding the tip without consent was incorrect. The author's response was a reaction to the bartender's unauthorized action. So, the author isn't in the wrong for not tipping because the bartender shouldn't have assumed the tip. The bartender's refusal to serve them is their business policy, but the initial action was on the bartender. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
