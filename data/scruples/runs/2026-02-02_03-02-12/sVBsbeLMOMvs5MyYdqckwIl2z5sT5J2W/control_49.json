      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again. The user went to a club with friends, ordered drinks for them, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling the user. The user was drunk but not too drunk to notice, and then decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender responded by saying he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip. The user is questioning if they were in the wrong.\n\nHmm. First, tipping customs can vary, but in many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected for service. Bartenders rely on tips as part of their income, right? So if the bartender added a tip automatically, maybe that's a standard practice. But the user didn't like that and refused to tip. The key here is whether the bartender had the right to add the tip without the user's knowledge. If that's against the club's policy or if it's a scam, then the user's reaction might be justified. But if adding a tip is standard and the user is just upset about being expected to tip, that's different.\n\nWait, the user says the bartender added 20% without telling him. So maybe the user thought he was being forced to pay an extra tip. But in some places, automatic gratuities are added for groups or during certain times. However, the user was not part of a group; he was paying for his four friends. The bartender's action might have been to get around the user not tipping. But the user refused, thinking it was unfair. The bartender then threatened not to serve them. \n\nIs the user wrong here? Well, the user did pay for the drinks, but didn't tip. If tipping is expected, then not tipping is considered rude. But the bartender adding the tip without consent might not be right either. The user's reaction could be seen as standing up for himself, but the threat of not serving is on the bartender's side. \n\nHowever, in many places, employees can't really refuse service for not tipping, but it's a common thing. Legally, they might not be able to do that. But socially, if you don't tip, you might not get served again. The user was drunk but not too drunk to know what was happening. So he had the choice to tip or not. By refusing, he was in the wrong because he didn't tip, even if the bartender added it himself. But if the bartender was supposed to ask first, maybe that's the fault. \n\nThis is a bit tricky. The user's argument is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage, but bartenders rely on tips. The user was willing to tip an appropriate amount but didn't like the automatic addition. So maybe the user acted out of turn by not tipping, even if the bartender made a mistake. \n\nI think the user is partially at fault for not tipping, but maybe the bartender was also wrong to add it without asking. But in terms of the main question, the user is the one who didn't tip. So the answer might be that the user is in the wrong (A), but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, if the bartender shouldn't have added the tip, then the user's response was justified (B). \n\nHmm. Maybe the standard is that tips are left to the customer's discretion. If the bartender added it without consent, that's a problem, but the user's refusal is also a problem. So depending on the context, but maybe the user is in the right because the bartender shouldn't have taken that initiative. But I'm not sure. I think in most cases, the customer is expected to tip, so the user is in the wrong for not tipping, regardless of the bartender's action. So answer A.\n"
