      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is they went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks each. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The person was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for service workers, including bartenders. Typically, a 15-20% tip is expected for good service. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge. That's unusual because usually, the customer decides the tip amount. If the bartender has the authority to add a tip automatically, that might be against the establishment's policy or even illegal, depending on local laws, as gratuities are usually meant to be voluntary.\n\nThe customer became aware of the tip being added and decided to tip 0% as a response. They were upset because the bartender took advantage of their state (being drunk). The bartender then refused service if they didn't tip. Refusing service for not tipping could be problematic because, while tipping is customary, it's not mandatory. However, in some cases, businesses might enforce a service charge policy, but that's usually pre-announced. If the bartender didn't inform them of a policy requiring a tip, then refusing service after the fact could be an issue.\n\nNow, the customer's reaction: they were within their right to dispute an automatically added tip. However, choosing to tip 0% might be seen as a form of retaliation. But if the bartender was indeed adding the tip without permission, the customer has a valid reason to refuse. On the other hand, the bartender might feel that the customer is being unreasonable, especially if the establishment has a policy of adding tips, which is sometimes done to ensure fair pay for staff.\n\nAnother angle is the customer's state of being drunk. Being drunk doesn't negate their right to make decisions about their bill, but it could affect their judgment. However, the customer claims they weren't too drunk to notice the added tip, so their decision was intentional.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the bartender's action of adding a tip without disclosure might be the problematic part. If that's against the establishment's policy, the bartender could be at fault. The customer's refusal to tip in response could be a justified protest. However, the bartender's refusal to serve them if they don't tip is where the conflict arises. In most cases, businesses can't force a tip, but they might have the right to refuse service if they choose. However, doing so because of a disagreement over tipping could be seen as poor customer service.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the bartender might have had the wrong approach by adding the tip without consent and then refusing service. The customer's anger is somewhat justified, but their response of 0% could be seen as a legitimate stand against the bartender's unauthorized action. Therefore, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's nuance here.\n"
