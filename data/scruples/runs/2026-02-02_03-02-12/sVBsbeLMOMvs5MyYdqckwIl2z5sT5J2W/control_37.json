      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person went to a club with friends, bought them drinks, and then at checkout, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The person was drunk but not too drunk to notice, so they decided to tip 0% instead, arguing that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who's drunk. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The person is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the etiquette around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for service staff like bartenders. The standard is usually around 15-20%, so the bartender adding 20% might be following that norm. However, the issue here is that the bartender did it without the customer's knowledge or consent. Normally, when you pay by card, the system might ask if you want to add a tip, but if the bartender just put it in without asking, that could be problematic. The customer might feel they were forced to tip even if they didn't want to.\n\nThe customer's response was to tip 0%, which is a direct reaction to the bartender's action. They felt it was an unfair tactic to add the tip without permission, especially considering their state of being drunk. The bartender then refused service over this. Now, the bartender's job might depend on tips, so refusing service could be a way to enforce tipping, but it's also a bit of a power play. \n\nLegally, in some places, you can't be forced to tip, but it's more of a social expectation. If the bartender is adding the tip without asking, maybe that's against club policies. The customer's argument is about autonomy\u2014choosing to tip or not. However, the customer's response to tip 0% could be seen as a form of protest, which might be a bit passive-aggressive but not necessarily wrong. The bartender's refusal to serve might be overstepping, as the customer is still paying for the drinks, just not tipping. \n\nSo, the key points are: Did the bartender have the right to add a tip without asking? Probably not, as it's the customer's choice. The customer's response was to not tip, which is their right, even if it's a reaction to the bartender's action. The bartender refusing service over this might be in the wrong because the customer is fulfilling their obligation by paying the bill. Therefore, the person's actions were a reasonable response to an unfair tactic by the bartender, so they aren't in the wrong.\n"
