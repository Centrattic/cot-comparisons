Now I was pretty drunk, but not enough to not notice him trying to put the tip percentage on his own. I responded by tipping him 0% telling him to not take advantage of people who are drunk. He responded by saying that he won't serve me anymore if I don't tip him. I was willing to tip an appropriate amount myself, but him just putting in a 20% tip without telling me rubbed me the wrong way.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender after the bartender added a 20% tip without being asked. The situation is that the author and their friends split 4 drinks, and the bartender automatically added a tip. The author, who was a bit drunk but not too drunk to notice, refused to tip and ended up getting told not to come back if they didn't tip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected, often around 15-20%. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the 20% without the customer's knowledge or consent. Normally, when someone adds a tip automatically, it's usually communicated, like a default setting on the payment system. If the customer notices and questions it, that's a valid concern.\n\nThe author's reaction could be seen as standing up for themselves against an unexpected charge. However, the author might have handled it better by explaining their stance instead of leaving a 0% tip. Refusing to tip at all after the initial action could be seen as rude or confrontational. The bartender's response of not serving them again if they don't tip is also a bit extreme, but bartenders do have the right to refuse service.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without permission. But in many venues, especially places with high minimum wages, automatic tips are common and expected. The author's refusal could be seen as not adhering to standard practices, which might place the blame on them.\n\nSo, considering both sides: the author's right to be aware of automatic tips and the bartender's expectation of a tip. The author might not be entirely wrong in questioning the automatic tip, but refusing to tip entirely could be seen as inconsiderate. The answer might lean towards the author being at least partially at fault for not tipping, even if the initial action was questionable.\n"
