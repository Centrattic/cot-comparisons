      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four of them for four drinks each. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The person was drunk but noticed and then tipped 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip. The person argues they wanted to tip an appropriate amount themselves but the bartender adding 20% without consent upset them.\n\nHmm. First, in many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary and expected for service workers. Bartenders rely on tips as part of their income. However, the bartender here added the tip automatically without informing the customer. Normally, you have control over the tip amount, so maybe the bartender shouldn't have done that. The customer's response was to tip 0%, which could be seen as a refusal to tip, which might be rude or against the norm. But the customer felt the bartender was taking advantage, especially when they were drunk. The bartender then threatened not to serve them if they didn't tip. \n\nIs the customer in the wrong? Well, the bartender's action of adding the tip without consent might be the issue. But the customer's reaction of giving 0% could be seen as retaliatory. However, if the tip is supposed to be a voluntary gesture, then the bartender shouldn't have assumed the customer would leave it. So the customer's refusal might be justified. Also, the bartender threatening service if they don't tip could be against the law in some places, as it might be considered price gouging or coercion. But I'm not sure about the legal aspect here. \n\nThe key points are: the bartender added a tip without permission, the customer was drunk but not too drunk to notice, the customer refused to tip, and the bartender refused service. So the customer's position is that the bartender shouldn't have taken advantage, while the bartender's position is that he deserves a tip. The person is asking if they're in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the customer was within their right to not tip, especially since the bartender added the tip without consent. However, refusing to tip at all might be socially frowned upon, but the customer's action was in response to the bartender's overreach. The bartender's threat to not serve them if they don't tip is problematic because in some places, businesses can't require a tip. So the customer isn't in the wrong here.\n"
