      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four people to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The author was drunk but noticed this and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to recall standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for services like bartending. The usual rate is around 15-20%, so the bartender adding 20% might be within that range. However, the key issue here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. Typically, the customer decides the tip amount, even if it's common to leave a percentage. Automatically adding a tip without consent could be problematic.\n\nThe author was drunk but not to the point of not noticing. So they felt the bartender was taking advantage, which led them to leave 0%. The bartender then refused service. Now, refusing service if someone doesn't tip is against the law in many places. Establishments can't force customers to tip, even if the service is poor. However, the bartender might have a valid point in terms of expected tipping norms. \n\nBut the main problem is the bartender adding the tip without asking. That's not standard. The customer has the right to decide their tip amount. The author's response of leaving 0% could be seen as their right, especially since they were aware of the automatic addition. However, the amount might be too harsh. Maybe they should have left a lower tip instead of zero. But the bartender's response of refusing service is also questionable because it's illegal in some places.\n\nSo, who is at fault? The bartender shouldn't have added the tip without consent. The author's reaction, while perhaps extreme (leaving 0%), was a response to that action. If the author had left a lower tip, maybe they wouldn't be in this situation. But the bartender's refusal to serve is also an issue. \n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, the bartender shouldn't have forced a tip. The customer isn't obligated to tip, even if it's customary. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not tipping, especially in response to the bartender's actions. However, the way they handled it (0%) might be seen as harsh, but the bartender's initial action was the root problem. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The bartender made the mistake by adding the tip without asking, and the author had the right to refuse, even if the response was a 0% tip. The bartender's refusal to serve is also problematic because it's against the law in many places to require tipping.\n"
