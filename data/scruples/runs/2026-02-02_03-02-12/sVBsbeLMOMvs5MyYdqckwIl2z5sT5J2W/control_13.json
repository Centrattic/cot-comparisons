      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that the user invited four friends to a club and paid for their drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The user, who was drunk but not too drunk to notice, decided to tip 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage of people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip. The user claims they wanted to tip appropriately but were upset about the bartender adding the tip without permission.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the usual tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, a standard tip is around 15-20%. Bartenders often rely heavily on tips as part of their income. If the bartender added a 20% tip automatically, maybe that's their policy, but the user might not know that. However, the user didn't like the idea of being forced to tip without being asked, which is a common criticism of automatic gratuities. So the user's reaction could be seen as standing up against an unwelcome practice. \n\nBut on the other hand, the user didn't tip at all, which could be seen as disrespectful or unfair to the bartender. The bartender might have been following a policy, but if the user didn't tip, they might be contributing to the bartender's lower earnings. Also, the user was drunk, which could affect their judgment, but they still made the decision. \n\nThe key points here are: automatic tipping without consent versus the customer's right to choose. Some businesses add a service charge, but if it's not communicated, it could be problematic. However, if the bartender is part of a staff that's supposed to be tipped, the user might have an obligation regardless. \n\nThe user's reasoning is that the bartender was taking advantage, but if the bartender is relying on tips, the user's refusal could be seen as inconsiderate. But if the tip was added without the user's knowledge, the user might not be responsible for that. The bartender's threat to not serve them anymore is also a point; in some places, refusing service due to tipping could be legally problematic. \n\nSo, considering all that, is the user in the wrong? If the user chose not to tip after the bartender added it, they might have a valid point about the automatic tip. However, their refusal to tip any amount could be seen as wrong because they didn't contribute anything. Alternatively, if the bartender's action was a policy, the user might still be obligated to tip. But the user's response was to counter with 0%, which might be seen as a justified protest. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn the end, the user might not be in the wrong if the bartender added the tip without consent, but they did choose not to tip at all. However, in many contexts, tipping is expected, so the user's choice not to tip could be seen as wrong regardless of the bartender's actions. So maybe the answer is A (yes, the user is wrong) because they didn't tip anything, even if they were upset about the automatic addition. But some might argue B (no) because the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without asking. It's a tricky balance between the two.\n"
