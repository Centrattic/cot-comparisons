      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip the bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club, invited four friends, and ordered four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The person was drunk but noticed and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The person claims they wanted to tip appropriately but the bartender adding the tip without asking made them angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary in service industries, and sometimes the total includes a gratuity, especially in places like clubs or restaurants. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without telling the customer. Normally, the tip is part of the customer's decision, so the bartender shouldn't have assumed and added it without permission. That's a bit of a breach of etiquette because the customer should have the choice.\n\nThe person was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They responded by not tipping at all and got into a confrontation. The bartender then refused service. Now, the question is whether the customer is in the wrong. \n\nFrom one angle, the customer had every right to be upset about the unauthorized tip addition. It's the bartender's responsibility to communicate the total, and adding a tip without asking could be seen as manipulative. The customer's response, however, is to not tip at all, which is a different issue. But if the bartender is refusing service because of the tip, that might be overstepping. However, in some cases, businesses can require a service charge, which might be part of their policy. \n\nBut wait, the customer was willing to tip appropriately. The problem was the bartender's action of adding the tip without consent. So the customer's refusal to tip might be a reaction to that. However, the customer's response of zero tipping could be seen as excessive. Maybe they should have adjusted the tip after the fact instead of refusing entirely. \n\nAnother angle: in some places, tipping is part of the employee's income, so not tipping could affect their earnings. But if the bartender added the tip without permission, the customer might feel disrespected. The confrontation escalated because the bartender refused to serve them, which is a strong move. \n\nSo, who's at fault? If the bartender followed the club's policy of adding a automatic gratuity, the customer might still be expected to tip. But if the policy wasn't communicated, the bartender's action was wrong. The customer's response, while perhaps impulsive due to being drunk, is understandable. However, not tipping in response to the bartender's mistake isn't the best approach. They could have corrected the tip amount after seeing the total. \n\nIn conclusion, the bartender made a mistake by not informing the customer about the tip, but the customer's refusal to tip at all, especially after the fact, might also be at fault. However, since the customer was willing to tip appropriately but was upset by the unauthorized addition, it's a bit of a gray area. But the bartender's refusal to serve them could be problematic. The answer might lean towards the customer not being in the wrong because the bartender's actions were improper. However, the customer could have handled it better. But in terms of blame, the main issue was the bartender's unauthorized tip, so the customer isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
