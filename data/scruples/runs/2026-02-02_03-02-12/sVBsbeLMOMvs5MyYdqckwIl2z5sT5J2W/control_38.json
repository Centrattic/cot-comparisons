      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends to drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The author was drunk but not too drunk to notice and then decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the usual tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, it's customary to tip service workers like bartenders around 15-20%. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the 20% tip without informing the customer. That's a bit unusual. Typically, the payment is split between the establishment and the server, so maybe the bartender was trying to adjust the payment to ensure he got his share, but that's not standard practice. \n\nThe author felt that the bartender was taking advantage of their state (being drunk) by adding the tip without asking. They responded by refusing to tip, which led to a confrontation. The author claims they were willing to tip an appropriate amount but were upset about the bartender's action. \n\nSo, who's in the wrong here? The bartender's action of adding a tip without permission might be a breach of standard practice. Tipping is usually the customer's discretion, not the server's. If the bartender added the tip unilaterally, that's probably not right. The author then exercised their right to not tip, which is their choice, even if it's not the norm. However, the author was in a position where they could have either paid the added tip and left or argued about it. But the bartender's threat to not serve them if they didn't tip is also problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, refusing to tip entirely could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the server is relying on tips as part of their income. But the situation is complicated by the bartender's initial action. The author might feel justified if they believe the bartender overstepped. However, in many places, the server is entitled to tips, so even if the bartender added it, the customer might still be expected to pay.\n\nI think the crux is whether the bartender had the right to add the tip without the customer's knowledge. If that's not allowed, then the author's response is justified. But if the bartender was within his rights, then the author is in the wrong. However, typically, servers don't add tips without the customer's consent. So maybe the bartender was wrong, and the author wasn't entirely in the wrong. The answer might be B, but it's a bit of a gray area. The author's refusal to tip after the bartender's action might be their right, but the confrontation could have been handled better. The bartender shouldn't have added the tip, and the author shouldn't have refused entirely. But given the choices, the author might not be in the wrong, so B.\n"
