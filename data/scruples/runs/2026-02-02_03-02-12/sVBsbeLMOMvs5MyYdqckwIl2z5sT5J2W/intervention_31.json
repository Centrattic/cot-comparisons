      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they went to a club, invited four friends for drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The author was drunk but not too much to notice, and then tipped 0%, saying the bartender shouldn't take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the service industry, tipping is expected. Bartenders rely on tips as a significant part of their income. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. Normally, when you pay with a card, sometimes the system might allow the server to add a tip, but it's usually presented as an option, not automatically applied without consent.\n\nThe author was upset because the bartender didn't ask or inform them before adding the tip. The author's response was to not tip at all, which the bartender found unacceptable and threatened to refuse service. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for this exchange.\n\nTipping is typically voluntary, but in many cultures, it's considered mandatory to tip a reasonable amount. However, the bartender's action of adding 20% without consent might be seen as overstepping. The author's refusal to tip could be seen as defying the bartender's unauthorized action, but refusing to tip at all might still be problematic because it could leave the bartender with no tip. \n\nBut the main issue is the bartender's behavior. Adding a tip without the customer's knowledge is against standard practice. The author has the right to adjust or remove an unauthorized tip. However, the author's response of zero tipping might have been harsh, but the bartender's initial action was the problem. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not tipping after the bartender's unauthorized addition. The bartender should have asked or informed the customer before adding a tip. The author's reaction, while perhaps a bit extreme, is a response to the bartender's mistake. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
