      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, they went to a club with friends and invited four people to four drinks each. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The author got angry and tipped 0%, saying the bartender shouldn't take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then threatened not to serve them again.\n\nHmm. First, the author was drunk but still aware enough to notice the tip. Normally, tipping is expected in service industries, especially in places like bars and restaurants as a way for staff to earn part of their income. If the author didn't tip because the bartender added a tip without asking, maybe that's their choice, but refusing to tip could be seen as rude or unfair to the bartender who relies on tips.\n\nHowever, the bartender's action of adding a tip without informing the customer might be the issue here. Some places automatically add a service charge, but it's usually disclosed. If the bartender did that secretly, that could be misleading. The author's response was to leave 0%, which might be their right, but the bartender's retaliation by refusing service seems harsh. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they were willing to tip appropriately if the bartender hadn't added the 20% themselves. So maybe the conflict was about the bartender's approach, not the author's intent to not tip. However, in many cultures, expecting a tip is part of the service, and not tipping could be considered inconsiderate regardless of the bartender's actions. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? If the bartender added the tip without permission, the author isn't necessarily at fault for objecting. But if the author chose to not tip at all, that might be seen as wrong. The key is whether the bartender had the right to add the tip unilaterally. If the author had the right to decide their own tip amount, and the bartender overstepped, then the author isn't wrong. But if the author's refusal to tip was a direct response, maybe they're both at fault to some extent. \n\nI think the main point is whether the bartender should have asked before adding the tip. If the author objected, maybe they have a point, but refusing to tip could still be seen as inconsiderate. However, the bartender's threat to not serve them again might be the bigger issue. So maybe the author isn't wrong, but the situation is a bit of a gray area. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the bartender's actions were possibly inappropriate.\n"
