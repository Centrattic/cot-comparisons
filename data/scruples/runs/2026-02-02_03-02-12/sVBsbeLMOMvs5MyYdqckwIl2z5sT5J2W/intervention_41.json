      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks each, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The author was drunk but noticed this and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip. The author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary and part of service workers' income. However, it's usually expected that the customer decides the tip amount unless it's a specific venue where a service charge is included. So, if the bartender added a tip without informing the customer, that might be a problem. The author had the right to adjust the tip, but they chose to leave 0%, which is a strong reaction.\n\nBut the key point here is the bartender's action of adding a tip without consent. If the venue automatically adds a tip, they should inform the customer. If the bartender did this on his own, that's against standard practice. The author's response was to not tip at all as a form of protest, which is understandable but might be seen as harsh. However, the bartender then threatened to not serve them again, which could be a violation of their right to refuse service (though some places have laws about that). \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who's drunk, which is a valid concern. However, the author did acknowledge the bartender's right to be tipped but chose to withhold it because of the unauthorized addition. The author's action was a direct response to the bartender's behavior, which might not be entirely their fault. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they were reacting to the bartender's unauthorized action. However, the decision to not tip at all might be seen as extreme. But given the bartender's mistake, the author's response is justified. The bartender also acted unprofessionally by threatening to not serve them. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
