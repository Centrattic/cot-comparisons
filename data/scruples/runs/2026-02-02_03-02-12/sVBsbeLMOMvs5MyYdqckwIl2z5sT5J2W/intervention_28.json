      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that the author went out with friends, invited four of them to drinks, and when paying, the bartender automatically added a 20% tip without telling them. The author, who was a bit drunk but not too much, responded by tipping 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is a common practice where a service charge is added to the bill, typically around 15-20%. However, the key issue here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. Normally, when you go to a restaurant or bar, you can choose how much to tip, and it's usually your responsibility to decide. The bartender adding it on their own might be against standard practice. If the establishment has a policy of automatically adding a service charge, that's different, but the scenario doesn't mention that. The author was upset because the bartender was taking advantage of their possible intoxication, which led them to refuse the tip.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they wanted to tip themselves, but the bartender's unauthorized addition was manipulative. The bartender then threatened not to serve them, which escalated the situation. Now, if the bartender was following a policy, maybe the author should have tipped regardless. But if the bartender made a unilateral decision, the author's response can be seen as standing up for their right to choose the tip amount. \n\nHowever, there's a counterargument. Tipping is part of the service industry's compensation, and even if the bartender added it without permission, the author could have still tipped on their own. But the author felt disrespected by the bartender's actions and reacted accordingly. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's action was a direct response to the bartender's perceived overreach. Since the bartender didn't inform them about the tip, the author's refusal isn't entirely their fault. The bartender's response of refusing service might also be problematic, as it's within the bar's policy to add a service charge, but if it's not, then the bartender's action was wrong. In such a case, the author isn't in the wrong for not tipping because the bartender didn't communicate properly. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
