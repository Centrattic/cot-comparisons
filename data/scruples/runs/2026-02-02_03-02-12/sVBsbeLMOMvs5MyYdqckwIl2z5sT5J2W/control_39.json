      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip the bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that the user and friends went to a club. They had drinks, and the user invited four friends to four drinks each. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing the user. The user was drunk but not so that they couldn't notice the tip. They then tipped 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender refused to serve them unless they tipped.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the usual expectations around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for service workers, and 15-20% is standard. However, the bartender added the tip without asking, which the user found offensive. The user's reaction was to leave a 0% tip, leading to a confrontation.\n\nIs the user wrong? Well, the bartender's action of adding the tip without permission might be an issue. Some places have automatic gratuities for groups or large parties, which should be communicated. If the bartender didn't inform the user, that could be a problem. The user's response of not tipping, while perhaps justified in their view, could be seen as not supporting the service worker who relies on tips. However, the bartender's refusal to serve because of the 0% tip might be an overreaction. The user was willing to tip an appropriate amount but was upset about the automatic addition. \n\nSo, the question is whether the user was in the wrong for not tipping after the bartender added a tip without notice. If the user felt compelled to not tip because they were angry about the automatic addition, that might be understandable. However, in many service industries, even if there's a policy, not tipping at all could be seen as disrespectful. But the bartender's initial action of adding a tip without consent might have been the root of the problem. \n\nThe key points here are whether the bartender had the right to add a tip unilaterally and whether the user had a valid reason to not tip. Since the user was aware and didn't want to be taken advantage of, maybe they weren't in the wrong. However, refusing to tip even after the initial mistake could still be seen as inconsiderate. But given that the user was inviting friends to drinks, perhaps the expectation was different. There might be ambiguity here, but I think the user's main issue was the lack of communication from the bartender. So, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
