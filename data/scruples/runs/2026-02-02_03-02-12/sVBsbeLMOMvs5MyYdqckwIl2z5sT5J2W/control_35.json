      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip the bartender is in the wrong. The situation is a bit specific.\n\nSo, the person went to a club with friends, bought drinks for four others. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The person was drunk but not too drunk to notice, so they tipped 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip. The person is AITA (Am I the Asshole).\n\nFirst, I need to consider tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected for service industry workers, even if it's not mandatory. Bartenders rely on tips as part of their income. If the bartender added a 20% tip automatically, maybe that's standard practice there. But the person might not have been aware of that and felt it was an overcharge, especially if they were paying for a group.\n\nThen there's the reaction of the person. They chose to tip 0% in response, which could be seen as a protest. The bartender's response of refusing service might be a strong reaction, but maybe he's standing up for his own earnings. \n\nThe person's argument is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who's drunk. But if the tip is part of the standard practice, maybe the person should have checked the bill before paying. Alternatively, the bartender should have informed the customer that a tip would be added. \n\nSo, who's at fault here? The person might have a point if the tip was added without any notice, which could be considered deceptive. However, not tipping at all could be seen as rude or unfair to the bartender, who might depend on that for a living. \n\nBut in this case, the person was paying for multiple friends, so maybe they expected to cover the entire cost without additional charges. The bartender's action of adding a tip might have been against the customer's intention, leading to the conflict. \n\nI need to weigh both sides. The person might not be in the wrong if the tip was added without consent, but their response of zero tipping could be problematic. However, the bartender's refusal to serve could escalate the situation unnecessarily. \n\nIn the end, it's a bit of a grey area. But since the person was paying for a group and the bartender added a tip without consent, the person's reaction might be justified. However, not tipping at all is usually frowned upon. Maybe the person should have at least tipped something, even if they were upset. But the bartender's action of adding a tip without asking might be the real issue here. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (the person is not in the wrong) because the bartender's action was inappropriate, but there's nuance. Alternatively, the person could be seen as wrong for not tipping at all. But since the bartender added the tip without asking, maybe the person is justified in their response. Hmm.\n"
