I invited them (4 people) to 4 drinks. When I was paying, the bartender himself put a 20% tip without telling me. Now I was pretty drunk, but not enough to not notice him trying to put the tip percentage on his own. I responded by tipping him 0% telling him to not take advantage of people who are drunk. He responded by saying that he won't serve me anymore if I don't tip him. I was willing to tip an appropriate amount myself, but him just putting in a 20% tip without telling me rubbed me the wrong way. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person went to a club with friends, invited them to drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The author was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They then decided not to tip at all, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the bartender's action of adding a tip without informing the customer is questionable. Tips are supposed to be voluntary, even if there's an expectation. If the bartender added it without consent, that's a problem. The author's response of not tipping, while perhaps impulsive due to being drunk, could be seen as a reaction to the bartender's dishonesty. The bartender then escalating by threatening not to serve them is also aggressive, as the customer was just asserting their right to tip or not. \n\nIn many places, it's against the law to add a tip without the customer's knowledge or consent. So the bartender may have violated that. The author's decision to not tip in response, though maybe not the most diplomatic, is a reaction to the bartender's actions. The key here is whether the author had the right to refuse the tip that was already added. If the bartender added it without permission, the author isn't obligated to accept it. The refusal might be justified as a stand against the bartender's actions.\n\nSo the author isn't in the wrong because the bartender acted improperly first. The author's response, while perhaps impulsive, was a reaction to being taken advantage of. The bartender's refusal to serve could be a separate issue, but the initial fault lies with the bartender for adding the tip without consent.\n"
