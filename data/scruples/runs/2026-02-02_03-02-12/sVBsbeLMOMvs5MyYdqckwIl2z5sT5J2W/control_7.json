      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves not tipping a bartender after the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The author was drunk but not too drunk to notice. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for service staff. Bartenders often rely on tips as a significant part of their income. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge. Normally, when you pay with a card, the tip is optional and you're supposed to enter it yourself. If the bartender added it without asking, that's a problem because it's not the customer's choice. The author was upset about being taken advantage of, especially when drunk, which could impair judgment but doesn't negate the right to be treated respectfully.\n\nThen there's the author's response: tipping 0% as a protest. That could be seen as a stand against the bartender's action, but it's also withholding a customary tip. However, the bartender's refusal to serve if they don't tip is a power play that's not appropriate. Service staff shouldn't force customers to tip. The author's right to choose how much to tip should be respected, even if they were drunk.\n\nBut some might argue that the author should have handled the situation differently, like discussing it calmly instead of retaliating. However, the bartender's initial action was the root issue. The author's response was a direct reaction to being disrespected. The bartender's threat not to serve is also a problem because it's using their position to pressure the customer.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author wasn't in the wrong because the bartender's action was inappropriate. The author had the right to refuse the forced tip, even if their response was harsh. The bartender should have asked before adding a tip. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
