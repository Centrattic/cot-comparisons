      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. \n\nFirst, the context: The person went to a club with friends, invited four friends to drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The person, who was drunk but not too drunk to notice, decided to tip 0% in response, telling the bartender not to take advantage. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip. The person wanted to tip appropriately but was upset about the bartender adding the tip without consent.\n\nSo, the key points here are the bartender's actions and the person's reaction. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary, and some states even require a minimum tip. However, the bartender adding a tip without informing the customer seems off. Normally, the tip is left at the customer's discretion unless it's an automatic gratuity added by the restaurant's system. But in this case, the bartender did it manually and didn't mention it, which could be seen as unethical or deceptive.\n\nThe person's response was to tip 0%, which might seem harsh, but they had a reason. They felt the bartender was taking advantage of their possibly impaired state. The bartender then threatened not to serve them, which is within his rights in some places, but the person's action was a direct response to an unexpected and possibly unfair practice.\n\nSo, is the person in the wrong? If the bartender added the tip without consent, the person has a valid reason to refuse. The tipping culture varies, but the key here is the bartender's action. If the law requires tips, the person might have an obligation, but if the bartender is adding it without permission, the person's refusal could be justified. However, in some regions, not tipping is considered rude, but the person's response was to a specific action by the bartender. \n\nI think the person isn't in the wrong because they were reacting to the bartender's unauthorized action. The bartender shouldn't have added the tip without informing them, so the person's zero tip was a response to that. The answer is B.\n"
