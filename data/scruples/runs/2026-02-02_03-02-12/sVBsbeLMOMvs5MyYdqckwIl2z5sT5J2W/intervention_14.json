      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is they went to a club with friends, invited four friends to drinks, paid, and the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The author, who was a bit drunk, noticed and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the usual tipping etiquette. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for services like bartending, often around 15-20%. But the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge. Normally, when you pay with a card, the tip is optional and you can adjust it. If the bartender added 20% without asking, that might be against the standard practice. Some places might have a policy where the server adds a service charge, but that's usually for large groups or special events. Since the group was four people, maybe it's not standard for the bartender to do that.\n\nThe customer was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They felt the bartender was taking advantage, so they decided to tip 0% as a response. The bartender then refused service. Now, the question is whether the customer was wrong. \n\nOn one hand, the customer might have a right to be upset if the bartender added a tip without permission. If the bartender's action was unauthorized or against the establishment's policy, the customer's reaction could be justified. On the other hand, the bartender might have been following a policy, and the customer's refusal to leave a tip could be seen as disrespectful or inconsiderate, especially towards the bartender's earnings.\n\nBut in many cases, tipping is a customer's choice. If the bartender added the tip without the customer's consent, that's an issue. The customer might feel they're being forced to pay more, which could justify their response. However, responding by not tipping and then causing a conflict might escalate the situation. The bartender's refusal to serve could be a consequence, but it's a bit of a cycle.\n\nI think the key here is whether the bartender had the authority to add a tip without the customer's knowledge. If the establishment allows servers to add service charges, maybe the bartender was within his rights. But if that's not the case, then the customer's reaction is valid. The customer's decision not to tip could be a form of protest against the unauthorized tip. However, the customer could have just left the tip as added and not taken it personally, or maybe confronted the bartender politely about it instead of retaliating. \n\nIn terms of etiquette, even if the bartender added the tip, the customer could have still left a tip as a matter of courtesy, but the customer might feel that the service wasn't worth it, hence the 0%. But the bartender's response was to not serve them, which is a harsh reaction. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the bartender initiated the unauthorized tip, which is against standard practice. The customer's response, while perhaps confrontational, was a reaction to that. The bartender's refusal to serve is more problematic because it's against their policy to refuse service once a customer is in the venue. So, the customer isn't in the wrong here.\n"
