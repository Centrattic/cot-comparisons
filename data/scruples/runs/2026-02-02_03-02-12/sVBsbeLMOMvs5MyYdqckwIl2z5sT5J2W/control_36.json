      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that the author went to a club with friends, paid for four of their drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The author, who was drunk but not too drunk, decided to tip 0%, saying the bartender shouldn't take advantage of people. The bartender then refused to serve them further unless they tipped.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the service industry like bartending, tipping is customary and often expected. The standard is usually around 15-20%, so the bartender adding a 20% tip might be within that range. However, the key point here is that the bartender didn't inform the author before adding the tip. That could be seen as a mistake on the bartender's part, as transparency is important in such transactions.\n\nThe author's reaction was to leave 0% in tips, which is definitely below the standard. But why? The author felt that the bartender was taking advantage by adding the tip without permission. The author was drunk but not incapacitated, so their decision was conscious. The bartender responded by refusing to serve, which is a strong reaction. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, not tipping at all is unusual unless there's a specific reason, like poor service. The author's justification is that the bartender added the tip without consent. However, even if the bartender made a mistake, the appropriate action would be to correct the error, not retaliate by not tipping. The author could have asked the bartender to remove the tip or discussed it calmly. Instead, the author chose to withhold all tips, which might be seen as excessive. \n\nOn the other hand, the bartender's action of adding a 20% tip without informing the customer is problematic. It's possible that the bartender assumed the author would go along with it, but that's not the customer's responsibility. The author's right to control their own tipping is valid, but the response of giving 0% might be harsh. However, the bartender's demand to tip as a condition to serving could be seen as inappropriate, as the service was already provided. \n\nIn terms of who is at fault, both parties might have erred. The bartender shouldn't have added the tip without permission, and the author shouldn't have withheld all tips without addressing the issue properly. But the question is specifically about the author's wrongdoing. The author's main issue is the 0% tip. If the service was satisfactory, not tipping at all is the main issue. However, the author's reason (the bartender adding the tip without consent) complicates this. \n\nIn many cultures, tipping is a customer's choice, but the standard is to tip for good service. The author's action could be seen as a protest against the bartender's mistake. But is that a valid reason? Maybe not. The correct approach would have been to inform the bartender of the error and then decide the appropriate tip amount. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's 0% tip might be inconsiderate, but the bartender's initial mistake also contributed. However, the author's response could be seen as inconsiderate, so maybe the author is at least partially at fault. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the author had asked to remove the added tip, that would be acceptable. Instead, they retaliated with a 0% tip, which is below the standard. Therefore, the author might be at fault. But some might argue that the bartender's action justified the author's protest. This is a bit nuanced. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is likely in the wrong because not tipping at all is outside the standard, even if there was a mistake. The appropriate action would be to address the error and then tip appropriately. The author didn't do that, so they might be at fault. However, the bartender also made a mistake by not clarifying. But the question is about the author's wrongdoing. The answer is probably A (Yes), the author is in the wrong.\n"
