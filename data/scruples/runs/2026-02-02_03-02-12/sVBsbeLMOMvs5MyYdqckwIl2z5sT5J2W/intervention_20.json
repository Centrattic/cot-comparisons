      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that the author went to a club with friends, invited them to four drinks each, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The author, who was drunk but not too drunk, decided to tip 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip. The author feels justified but wants to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm, so first, the key points here are the bartender adding a tip without informing the customer. Normally, tips are supposed to be discretionary, right? But sometimes places automatically add a gratuity, especially for groups or events. However, the author wasn't informed that the tip was added, which is a problem. The bartender might have done that to ensure a better tip or because it's a policy, but if it's not communicated, that's an issue. The author was drunk but not to the point of being unaware, so they noticed the tip was added. \n\nThe author's response was to remove the tip and set it to 0%, which could be seen as a protest. They argued that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who's drunk. The bartender then threatened not to serve them. Now, is the author in the wrong? Well, the bartender's actions of adding a tip without consent might be the initial wrongdoing. The author is within their rights to correct the tip amount if they disagree, especially if they feel misled. However, refusing to tip altogether could be seen as a conflict. But in many places, especially where tips are a significant part of the worker's income, not tipping at all might be considered rude or inconsiderate. \n\nBut here, the author's reasoning is that the bartender added the tip without permission, so they were correcting the mistake. The problem is that the bartender didn't ask, so the author's action was a response to that. The bartender then took it as a refusal, leading to the threat. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because the initial action of the bartender was inappropriate. However, not tipping at all is against social norms even if there's a dispute. But in this case, the author was trying to prevent an unauthorized tip. \n\nI think the answer is that the author isn't in the wrong because the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without permission. The author corrected the situation, which is reasonable. So the answer would be B.\n"
