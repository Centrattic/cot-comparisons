He responded by saying that he won't serve me anymore if I don't tip him. I was willing to tip an appropriate amount myself, but him just putting in a 20% tip without telling me rubbed me the wrong way.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by not tipping the bartender after the bartender added a 20% tip without asking.\n\nFirst, the context: The author went to a club with friends, bought four drinks for friends. The bartender added a 20% tip automatically. The author was drunk but not too drunk to notice. The author then tipped 0% as a response to the bartender's action, and the bartender threatened not to serve them again. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Tipping norms vary, but in many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected, and sometimes places automatically add a gratuity for large groups or events. The author might have felt the bartender was taking advantage by adding it without asking, especially since they were drunk. But the author's response was to not tip at all, which could be seen as retaliatory. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author had a valid reason to not tip. If the bartender added the tip without consent, maybe the author felt it was unfair. But is that a valid reason not to tip? If the author was willing to tip appropriately but didn't want the bartender to add it without asking, maybe they should have communicated that instead of setting it to 0%. \n\nAlso, retaliating by not tipping 0% might be seen as inconsiderate, even if the bartender acted improperly. Bartenders rely heavily on tips, so refusing to tip altogether could be harsh. The author's argument is that the bartender shouldn't have taken advantage when they were drunk, but that might not excuse not tipping. \n\nOn the other hand, the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without discussing. Maybe the author was within their right to challenge that, but the response of 0% is where it might go wrong. So the author's intention was to stand up against the bartender's action, but the execution could be seen as excessive. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they were reacting to the bartender's unprofessional behavior, but their choice of response (0% tip) could be seen as wrong. It's a bit of a grey area, but maybe the answer is B (No) because the author was within their right to question the automatic tip, but their response was perhaps not the best. However, the core issue is whether they are in the wrong. If the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without asking, then the author's refusal to tip in response isn't wrong. Alternatively, if the automatic tip is a standard practice, the author's reaction is overzealous. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (No) because the author had a reason to be upset with the bartender's unprofessionalism, even if their response wasn't ideal. The bartender's threat to not serve them is also unprofessional. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
