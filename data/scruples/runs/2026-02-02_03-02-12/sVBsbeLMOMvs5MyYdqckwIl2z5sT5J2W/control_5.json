      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, paid for four drinks. The bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The person was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They then tipped 0%, told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender refused to serve them if they didn't tip. The user wants to know if they're the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected for services like bartending. It's customary to tip 15-20% or more. However, the situation here is that the bartender added the tip without asking. Normally, the customer would have control over the tip amount. If the bartender automatically added it, that's unusual. Some places might have a policy of adding a service charge, but it's usually communicated. The user might feel disrespected because they weren't consulted.\n\nThe user was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They responded by not tipping and confronting the bartender. The bartender then refused to serve them. The key points here are whether the bartender had the right to add a tip without permission and whether the user's response was justified.\n\nTipping is a customer choice, not a mandatory fee. If the bartender added a tip without asking, that's a problem. The user's reaction might be seen as standing up for their right to decide the tip. However, not tipping at all is a strong response. Even if the bartender made a mistake, the user could have tipped 0% and left, but by confronting the bartender, they escalated the situation. The bartender's refusal to serve might be against the law in some places, as employees can't deny service over a tip dispute. But maybe in the club's context, they have different rules.\n\nSo, the user's actions could be seen as justified in not accepting the automatic tip, but their approach might have been confrontational. The bartender's actions of adding a tip without consent are questionable. The user's response of not tipping and telling the bartender off might be within their rights, but maybe they could have handled it differently. The main issue is the bartender's lack of communication. If the user is in the wrong, it's because they didn't tip at all, but if the bartender shouldn't have added the tip, the user isn't the wrong one. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the user not being in the wrong because the bartender shouldn't have done that without consent.\n"
