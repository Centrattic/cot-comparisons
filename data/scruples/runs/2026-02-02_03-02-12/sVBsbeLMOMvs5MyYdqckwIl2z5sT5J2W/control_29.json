      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they went to a club with friends, paid for four drinks, got a 20% tip added by the bartender without being told, then the author didn't tip and got the bartender mad. The question is whether the author was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected for services like bartending. The usual tip is around 15-20%, so the bartender adding 20% might be standard. But the issue here is that the author wasn't told about the tip being added. That could be a problem because the customer might not know it's happening. However, some places automatically add a service charge, especially for large groups or events. So maybe that's standard there.\n\nThen, the author was drunk but still noticed the tip. They decided to tip 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve if they didn't tip. The author argues that the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without permission. \n\nOn one hand, the bartender might be following a policy of automatic gratuities, which is common in some industries. If that's the case, the author might have been misinformed or the bartender didn't explain properly. On the other hand, the author refused to tip, which could be seen as not respecting the standard practice. If the bartender is relying on tips, not tipping could be a problem. However, the author felt misled by the automatic addition without prior notice.\n\nI need to weigh these points. If the bartender had a policy of adding a tip, the author might have been wrong to not tip. But if the bartender didn't inform them, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. But in many cases, even if there's an automatic gratuity, the customer might still expect to leave a tip. So the author's refusal could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the bartender's action of adding the tip without consent might be the root of the problem. \n\nI think the key here is whether the bartender followed proper protocol. If they usually add a tip automatically but didn't mention it, that's their fault. But if it's a known policy, the author is at fault. Since the author didn't know, maybe the bartender should have informed them. But in practice, if the author didn't tip despite the added 20%, that could be wrong. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't leave a tip even after the added 20%, which might not be enough. Wait, but the author said they wanted to tip an appropriate amount themselves. But they ended up not tipping at all. That seems harsh. So perhaps the author is in the wrong. Alternatively, if the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without permission, then the author is not wrong. \n\nHmm. It's a bit of a toss-up. But in most service industries, tipping is expected, and if the customer chooses to not tip, even if they were added a tip automatically, maybe the customer is at fault. However, the bartender's action of adding the tip without consent might be the issue. But if the bartender is allowed to do that, then the author is wrong for not tipping. I think in most cases, the customer is expected to tip regardless of automatic additions. So the answer might be A. But maybe the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without informing, so the answer is B. I'm a bit confused. Maybe the correct answer is A because the author didn't tip despite the added 20% which is part of the expected practice. But if the bartender didn't inform them, maybe B. I think the key point is that the author didn't tip at all, which is wrong, so AITA would be A. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, since the 20% was added automatically, maybe the author is not wrong because the tip was already taken. But the author's response of not tipping anything seems excessive. So maybe A is correct.\n"
