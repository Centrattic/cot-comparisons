      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip their bartender is at fault. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks each, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The person was drunk but noticed and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them further if they didn't tip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the usual tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary in service industries like bars. The standard is usually 15-20%, and sometimes people tip based on their own discretion. However, in this case, the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. That's a key point. The customer might not expect an automatic tip, especially if they're used to paying separately. Being drunk might affect judgment, but the person claims they were aware enough to notice the tip being added.\n\nAnother angle is the bartender's response. By refusing service over the tip, he's enforcing a policy. But if the establishment doesn't have a clear policy about automatic gratuities, the bartender might overstepped. Also, the customer's intention was to tip appropriately but was upset by the unauthorized addition. The customer's reaction, while maybe confrontational, was in response to the bartender's action. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the customer didn't want to be forced to pay a tip they didn't agree to, especially when they were in a vulnerable state (drunk). The bartender's refusal to serve could be seen as holding a power imbalance. \n\nSo, the question is whether the customer was wrong for not tipping after the bartender's unauthorized action. Since the customer was within their right to dispute an automatic tip, and the bartender's response was aggressive, the blame might lie more with the bartender. Therefore, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong).\n"
