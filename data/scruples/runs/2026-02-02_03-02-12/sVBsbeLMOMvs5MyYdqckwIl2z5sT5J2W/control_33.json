      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that the person went to a club with friends, bought drinks for four friends, and the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The person was drunk but noticed the bartender adding the tip and decided to tip 0%, telling him not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped.\n\nSo first, I need to figure out who's in the wrong here. The user is asking for an analysis. Let me break it down. \n\nTipping customs can vary, but in many places, especially in the US, a 15-20% tip is considered standard for service workers like bartenders. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. That seems a bit odd. Usually, the customer decides the tip amount, and while some places might automatically add a gratuity for large groups or certain services, it's not common for a bartender to do that. \n\nThe customer noticed this and decided not to tip because they felt the bartender was taking advantage of their drunken state. The bartender then threatened not to serve them unless they tipped. That's a problem because threatening to not serve someone unless they tip is against anti-tipping laws in some places. For example, in the US, it's illegal for a server to refuse service because a customer didn't tip. So the bartender's action might be the issue here.\n\nBut the customer's response was to tip 0%, which might be seen as a refusal to pay any tip. However, given that the bartender added the tip without consent, maybe the customer had a right to not tip in that instance. Plus, the bartender's threat to not serve them is a violation, which complicates things.\n\nSo, is the customer in the wrong? If the bartender added the tip without permission, the customer might not be at fault for rejecting that. The bartender's behavior was inappropriate. However, the customer could have communicated their refusal to pay the added tip more constructively, maybe by discussing it instead of just setting it to 0%. But given the bartender's threat, the customer's stance might be justified.\n\nAlternatively, some might argue that the customer should have just paid the tip as it's customary, even if the bartender added it without asking. But that depends on the local norms and laws. In many places, tips are supposed to be voluntary, so the bartender shouldn't force them. The customer's response, while perhaps confrontational, might be a reaction to the bartender's misstep.\n\nSo putting it all together, the customer might not be in the wrong because the bartender initiated the conflict by adding the tip and refusing service. The customer's action was in response to that, and the bartender's refusal to serve is the bigger issue. Therefore, the answer might be B (No).\n"
