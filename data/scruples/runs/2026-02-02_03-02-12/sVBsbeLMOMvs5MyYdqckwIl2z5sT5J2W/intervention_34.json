      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that the author and friends went to a club, had drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The author was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They then tipped 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage. The bartender refused to serve them unless they tipped. The user thinks the author is in the right, but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the usual tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for service workers, often around 15-20%. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without asking. Normally, the customer should have control over the tip amount, so automatically adding it without consent might be an issue. The author might feel that the bartender was taking advantage by not getting their permission first. \n\nBut the author's response was to tip 0%, which is a form of refusal. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them unless they tipped. That's a problem because refusing service over a tip could be against the law in some places. However, the author's stance is that the bartender shouldn't have added the tip unilaterally. \n\nSo, the author's actions were a response to the bartender's actions. If the bartender didn't have the authority to add the tip without informing, then the author's refusal might be justified. On the other hand, if tipping is expected, not tipping at all could be seen as rude or inconsiderate. But the main conflict is the bartender's unauthorized addition of the tip.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, businesses can't automatically add tips to a bill without the customer's consent. Some places have laws against it. So the bartender might have been in the wrong by doing that. The author's response, while extreme (0% tip), could be a reaction to that. The bartender's refusal to serve is also questionable because it's their job to serve customers, and they can't discriminate based on tipping unless it's a private club. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because the bartender's initial action was inappropriate. The author's response, while not conventional, was a reaction to being taken advantage of. The bartender's threat to not serve them is also problematic. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
