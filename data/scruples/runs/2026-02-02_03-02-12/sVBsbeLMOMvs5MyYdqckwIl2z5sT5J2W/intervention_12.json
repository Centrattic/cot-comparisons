      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip the bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that the person went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The person was drunk but noticed this and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip. The author thinks they're not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the standard practices around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary in service industries like bartending. Bartenders rely on tips as part of their income. However, the key point here is that the bartender added a 20% tip without the customer's knowledge or consent.\n\nSo, usually, when you pay with a card, the system might prompt for a tip, but it's optional. If the bartender manually added the tip without informing the customer, that's a bit odd. The customer noticed this and chose not to tip, which led to a confrontation. The person felt wronged because they didn't agree to the automatic tip, especially since they were already paying for multiple drinks.\n\nOn the other hand, the bartender might have thought that a tip was expected, and adding it was a way to ensure they received it. But doing so without asking could be seen as overstepping. The customer's response was to refuse to tip, which the bartender found unacceptable.\n\nLegally, the customer isn't obligated to tip, even if they are in a place where it's customary. However, the social norm is that you should tip if you received service. But the bartender's action of adding the tip without consent complicates things. The customer had the right to refuse, but maybe they could have handled it more politely, like asking the bartender to remove the tip or discussing it instead of flatly refusing.\n\nThe person was drunk, which might have affected their judgment. However, they still had the capacity to make the decision. The bartender's threat to not serve them anymore if they didn't tip could be seen as a power play, but the customer also has the right to choose not to tip, even if it's socially frowned upon.\n\nIn summary, while the customer's action of not tipping could be considered rude or against social customs, the bartender's action of adding a tip without permission was also inappropriate. The customer isn't in the wrong for refusing to pay a tip that wasn't agreed upon, even if they could have handled it more tactfully. So the answer is B.\n"
