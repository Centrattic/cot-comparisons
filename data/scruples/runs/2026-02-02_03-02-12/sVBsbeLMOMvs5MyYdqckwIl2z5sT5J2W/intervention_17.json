      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that the author went to a club with friends, invited four people to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling the author. The author, even though drunk, noticed this and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then said he won't serve them anymore unless they tip. The author didn't want to tip because the bartender added the tip without consent.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are: the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. Normally, tips are supposed to be voluntary and based on the customer's discretion. If the bartender automatically added a tip without asking, that's possibly against the standard practice. In many places, restaurants can add a service charge for large groups or specific services, but that's usually disclosed beforehand. Here, it seems like the bartender just did it on their own, maybe to increase their own tip. \n\nThe author noticed this and decided to tip 0% as a response. The author was drunk but not so much that they couldn't notice the tip being added. The bartender then refused to serve them. The author's reasoning is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who's drunk. But the bartender might argue that they were just adding the tip as part of the payment process, not exploiting the customer.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author has a point if the bartender didn't inform them. However, the author's response was to not tip at all. Even if the bartender added the tip, the customer could have just confirmed the total and paid without adding extra. But the author chose to tip 0%, which might be seen as retaliatory. The bartender's response of refusing service could be problematic because they can't legally deny service for not tipping, but maybe in a club setting, they have more leeway.\n\nSo, considering the bartender's actions first: adding a tip without consent is probably wrong. The author's response, while not the most diplomatic, is a reaction to that. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because the initial action by the bartender was inappropriate. However, the author could have just paid the correct amount instead of retaliating with 0%. But since the bartender didn't inform them, the author's action could be justified as a protest. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the bartender's actions were questionable. The author had a right to be upset and took a stance against being taken advantage of, even if the method was a bit confrontational. The bartender shouldn't have added the tip without asking, so the author isn't at fault here.\n"
