      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author went to a club with friends, invited them to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing the customer. The author noticed and decided not to tip, responding by setting the tip to 0% and telling the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then threatened not to serve them anymore. The author says they were drunk but not to the point of not noticing the tip being added. They were willing to tip but were upset about the bartender adding it without asking.\n\nNow, thinking about tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is part of service industry wages. However, the expectation is usually that the customer decides the tip amount. If the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge or consent, that might be an issue. The author's response was to set it to 0%, which could be seen as a form of protest.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the key points here are the bartender adding the tip without permission and the customer's reaction. The customer might feel that the bartender was taking advantage, especially if the customer was already drunk. However, not tipping at all could be seen as not following standard etiquette, even if the bartender made a mistake. But the bartender's action of adding the tip without asking might be the root problem here. If the customer felt coerced or misled, their response might be justified. On the other hand, the author could have asked the bartender to remove the tip and then decided on a proper amount. Instead, they chose to not tip at all, which is a strong reaction.\n\nBut maybe the bartender's behavior was inappropriate. Adding a tip without informing the customer could be considered unethical or against restaurant policies. If that's the case, the customer's frustration is understandable. However, the customer's response might still be seen as extreme. Not tipping could affect the bartender's income, especially if they rely on tips. So there's a balance between the bartender's actions and the customer's reaction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is in the right because the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without permission. Tipping is supposed to be voluntary, so the bartender's action might have been against the customer's wishes. The customer's response, while not tipping, might be a way to express that the tip wasn't their choice. However, the threat from the bartender to not serve them could be an overreaction as well.\n\nIn some cases, venues might automatically add a tip for large groups or to account for service charges, but usually, that's communicated beforehand. If the club didn't inform the customer about a service charge, then the bartender's action was wrong. If it was a service charge, then it's different, but if it's a tip, then it's supposed to be voluntary.\n\nSo considering all this, the author might not be in the wrong because the bartender added the tip without asking. The customer's right to decide the tip amount is important. However, the customer's choice to leave 0% could be seen as harsh. But given the bartender's initial action, the customer had a reason to be upset. I think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. The bartender's action was the issue. So the answer would be B.\n"
