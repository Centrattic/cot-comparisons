      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not tipping their bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited 4 people to 4 drinks, paid, and the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The author was drunk but noticed this, so they tipped 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know the answer.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is part of a group where they paid for drinks for others. The bartender added a tip without informing them. The author was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They responded by not tipping and confronting the bartender, who then refused to serve them.\n\nNow, considering typical tipping customs in the US, tipping is expected in service industries, especially in places like clubs or bars. However, the bartender adding a tip without the customer's knowledge might be an issue. Some places do automatically add a gratuity for large groups or for events, but the author might not be aware of that policy. \n\nThe author's response was to tip 0%, which could be seen as a protest against the bartender's action. However, the bartender might have a policy to add a service charge for groups, which is different from a tip. If that's the case, the author's refusal to accept it could be problematic. But if the bartender was just adding their own tip without the customer's consent, that might be an overreach.\n\nThe author's reasoning was that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who's drunk. Since they were drunk but still coherent enough to notice and act, maybe the author felt wronged. However, refusing to tip entirely, even if there's a legitimate reason for the added tip, could be seen as inconsiderate, given that the bartender's job depends on tips.\n\nOn the other hand, if the bartender didn't inform the customer about the added tip, that's a customer service issue. The customer has the right to know what's being added to their bill. But the author's response was to not tip at all, which might be an overreaction. Maybe a better approach would be to ask about the added tip or to discuss it calmly.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author's actions were justified. The bartender might have added a service charge instead of a tip, which is different. If it's a service charge, the customer can't control it, but if it's a personal tip, the author might have the right to object. However, the author's zero tip might be seen as withholding a customary tip, leading to the bartender's refusal to serve. In that case, the author could be in the wrong for not tipping, regardless of the bartender's actions. Alternatively, if the bartender's action was improper, the author might have a point.\n\nI think the key here is understanding the difference between a service charge and a tip. If the bartender added a service charge, the author can't control it, but if the bartender just added their own tip without the customer's knowledge, that's an issue. The author's response of zero tip might be justified if they believed the bartender was being unfair. However, in standard practice, not tipping at all is considered rude, especially after a service. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not tipping, even if the bartender made a mistake. The appropriate action might have been to question the added tip or to tip a lower amount instead of zero. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong), but I'm a bit torn. Alternatively, if the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without consent, maybe the author isn't wrong. But generally, not tipping is frowned upon regardless of the reason. So probably answer A.\n"
