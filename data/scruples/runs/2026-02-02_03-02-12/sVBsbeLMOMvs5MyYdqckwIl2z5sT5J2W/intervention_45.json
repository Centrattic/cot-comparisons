      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they invited four friends for drinks, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them, the person got mad, left 0%, and the bartender refused to serve them further.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the service industry like bars, tipping is expected and often added by the establishment automatically. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. Normally, the customer should decide the tip amount, even if it's common to tip a certain percentage. But when the establishment automatically adds a tip, that's usually disclosed upfront. If the bartender did this secretly, that's an issue because it's not transparent.\n\nThe person was drunk but not too drunk to notice the bartender's action. They responded by not tipping, which led to the bartender threatening not to serve them. The person's reasoning is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who's drunk. But wait, the customer was the one who invited friends and possibly consumed alcohol. The bartender's job is to serve, but if the customer becomes abusive or refuses to pay, the bartender has the right to refuse service.\n\nNow, the question is about fault. The customer might be in the wrong if they intentionally refused to pay a tip when it's customary, but in this case, the bartender added a tip without permission. The customer's reaction could be seen as a stand against unfair practices. However, refusing to leave any tip might still be wrong because even if the added tip was unauthorized, the customer could have chosen to leave a small amount instead of zero. The bartender's threat to refuse service is also a standard practice when a customer is being difficult or not paying.\n\nSo, evaluating both sides: the bartender's action of adding a tip without disclosure is questionable, but the customer's refusal to tip at all might be seen as inconsiderate. However, the customer's main issue was the lack of transparency. In many cases, if a service is good, people tip regardless. But here, the customer felt wronged by the bartender's action. The bartender's response to not serve them is within their rights, but it's a bit of a standoff.\n\nI think the customer isn't entirely at fault because the bartender acted unethically by adding a tip without consent. However, the customer could have handled it differently by, say, leaving a small tip or negotiating. But the fact that the bartender was trying to exploit the drunk customer is a red flag. So, the answer might lean towards the customer not being at fault.\n"
