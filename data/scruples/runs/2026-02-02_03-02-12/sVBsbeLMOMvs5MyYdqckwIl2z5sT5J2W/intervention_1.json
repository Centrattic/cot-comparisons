      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that the author and friends went to a club, the author invited four friends to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing the author. The author, who was drunk but not too drunk to notice, then decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender responded by refusing to serve them if they didn't tip. The author is now wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping, especially in places like clubs where bartending is a tipped occupation. Typically, in the US, a 15-20% tip is standard for service. The author didn't tip anything, which is below that standard. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the 20% tip without the customer's knowledge. That seems like a problem because the customer should be aware of the tip amount they're contributing. The bartender might have had the authority to add the tip, but it's possible that it's against company policy to add a tip without informing the customer. \n\nThe author was drunk but not so drunk that they didn't notice the tip being added. So the author's response was based on the bartender's action of adding the tip without permission. The author's decision to not tip and to confront the bartender could be seen as a reaction to that. But the author didn't tip at all, which is below the standard. However, the bartender's actions might have been unethical or against policy, which the author is objecting to. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? On one hand, not tipping at all is a violation of the usual tipping norms. On the other hand, the bartender added a tip without consent, which the author is protesting. The author's intention was to tip an appropriate amount but was upset by the bartender's actions. However, by not tipping anything, the author didn't leave any tip, which could be seen as inconsiderate. But the bartender's actions might have been the initial wrong here. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the bartender was allowed to add the tip without informing the customer. If that's against policy, then the bartender is in the wrong. If it's allowed, then the author not tipping in response could be seen as a mistake because they don't leave any tip. But since the author was trying to correct an unauthorized tip, maybe it's a gray area. However, in standard practice, customers are expected to tip, and refusing to tip entirely, even in protest, might be considered inconsiderate. So the author might be at fault for not tipping, even if they had a reason. But the bartender's actions might have been the initial wrongdoing. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the bartender added the tip without consent, the author's response is a reaction to that, but not tipping zero is still not appropriate. The author could have corrected the tip to their desired amount instead of leaving zero. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't tip at all, even if they had a reason. Alternatively, if the bartender's action was wrong, the author's response is justified. But in general, tipping is expected, and not tipping is considered rude regardless of the reason. So maybe the answer is A (author is at fault) because they didn't tip, even if the bartender's action was wrong. But there's also the aspect of the bartender adding the tip without permission, which complicates things. However, the question is about the author's wrongdoing. In most social contexts, not tipping is seen as wrong, so the author is at fault. Answer A.\n"
