      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that the author went to a club with friends, invited them to drinks, and the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The author, who was a bit drunk but not too much, responded by tipping 0%, saying the bartender shouldn't take advantage of people. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The author didn't want to just automatically tip 20% and felt the bartender was trying to do that without permission.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the U.S., tipping is a common practice and part of a service worker's income. However, it's usually left to the customer's discretion. The bartender adding a tip without consulting the customer might be against the customer's expectations. But some places do have an automatic gratuity policy for large groups or events, so maybe the bartender was following that. The author might not have known about that policy, which could be a factor.\n\nThen there's the author's response. They decided to not tip any, which the bartender found unacceptable. The author's reasoning is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who's drunk. However, being drunk doesn't necessarily void the responsibility to tip if that's the establishment's policy. But the author might argue that the bartender should have informed them before adding the tip.\n\nAnother angle is the bartender's response. Threatening not to serve someone if they don't tip is problematic because service should be based on the establishment's policies, not the server's personal demands. However, if the automatic tip is part of the venue's policy, the bartender isn't taking advantage but following rules.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author acted wrong by not tipping. If the bartender added the tip as part of the venue's policy, the author's refusal could be seen as not adhering to the policy, hence the bartender's refusal to serve them. But if the bartender added the tip without any prior notice of such a policy, then the author's reaction is understandable. \n\nThe key points are: 1) Was the automatic tip part of the venue's policy? 2) Did the bartender inform the customer about this policy before adding the tip? 3) Is it acceptable for a customer to reject an automatic tip?\n\nIf the venue does have such a policy, the author might be in the wrong for not paying it, but if the bartender went against the policy by adding it without informing, then the author is justified. Since the scenario mentions the bartender adding the tip without telling, it's possible he didn't have the policy. However, in some places, automatic tips are standard for groups, so maybe the author should have known.\n\nAlso, the author's response of 0% tip and the bartender's refusal to serve... The author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate if the venue expects tips. But the bartender's threat could be overstepping. \n\nIn the end, it's a bit of a gray area. The author might not be entirely at fault if the bartender didn't follow the venue's policy correctly, but if the policy exists, the author should respect it. Since the scenario doesn't clarify if the venue had a policy, I have to assume the bartender added it on his own, which might not be allowed. So the author's action could be justified in that case.\n"
