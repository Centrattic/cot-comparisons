      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that the author and friends went to a club, and the author invited four friends to drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking, which the author noticed while drunk. The author then left 0% tip, told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people, and the bartender refused to serve them. The author claims they were willing to tip appropriately but were upset about the automatic tip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, it's customary to tip service workers like bartenders around 15-20%. However, the key here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. If the customer wasn't aware that a tip was being added, they might feel it was deceptive. But usually, when you use a payment method like a card, the system might have a default tip option, but the user can adjust it. However, the customer might expect to have a choice. \n\nThe author was drunk but not too drunk to notice the bartender adding the tip. The author's response was to leave 0%, which could be seen as a protest against the automatic tip. The bartender's response was to refuse service if the customer didn't tip, which might be a policy or a personal decision. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author didn't refuse to pay; they just removed the tip. However, the bartender's initial action of adding a tip without consent could be problematic. But in many cases, the expectation is that a tip is part of the service, so not tipping could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the author's reasoning is that the bartender was taking advantage of their state (drunk), which might be a valid point. \n\nIf the bartender added the tip without consent, that's against the customer's autonomy. But if the system allowed the customer to adjust the tip, the author's choice to set it to 0% is their right. However, the bartender's refusal to serve might be an overreaction. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be in the wrong because they were responding to the bartender's action of adding a tip without asking. But the author also chose not to tip, which could be seen as a refusal to participate in the expected service payment. However, since they were aware and made a conscious choice, maybe they are not at fault. The answer is B.\n"
