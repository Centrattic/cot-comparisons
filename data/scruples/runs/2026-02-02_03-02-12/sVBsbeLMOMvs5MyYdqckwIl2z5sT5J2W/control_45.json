      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping their bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four of them to drinks. The bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The author, who was drunk but not too drunk, decided to tip 0% in response. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected, and it's usually a percentage of the bill. Bartenders rely heavily on tips as part of their income. So by default, adding a 20% tip is standard practice in some regions. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's consent. That's a bit unusual because typically, the customer decides the tip amount, even if servers might suggest or add a default. The author felt that the bartender was taking advantage of them being drunk, which is a valid concern. People might feel disrespected if someone else adds a tip without asking.\n\nThe author's response was to tip 0%, which is a form of protest. But refusing to tip at all can be seen as a violation of social norms, especially in industries where tips are a significant part of the worker's pay. However, the author's reasoning is that the bartender shouldn't assume they want to tip. The bartender then threatened not to serve them if they didn't tip, which is a bit of a standoff. \n\nNow, considering both sides: the author might have a point in feeling that the bartender overstepped by adding a tip without consent. On the other hand, the author's response of zeroing the tip could be seen as retaliatory and not in line with standard tipping practices. The bartender's refusal to serve might be an overreaction, but it's also their job to enforce some tipping policy, perhaps. \n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong, the author's action might be considered wrong because they didn't tip at all, but their justification is that the bartender shouldn't have added a tip without asking. The bartender's action of adding the tip without communication is also questionable. However, the author's decision to tip 0% is a direct response to the bartender's action. So, it's a bit of a gray area. But since the author is being asked if they are in the wrong, and the situation is more about the bartender's initial action, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B). However, some might argue that the author should have tipped appropriately regardless. It's a tough call, but given the bartender's unauthorized addition, the author's response could be justified.\n"
