      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. \n\nSo, the scenario is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends to drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The author was pretty drunk but still noticed this and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the usual tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, a 15-20% tip is customary for service staff. However, the key here is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's consent. Normally, when you pay with a card, sometimes the restaurant adds a tip automatically, but they should let you know first. If the bartender did this without informing the author, that could be an issue. \n\nThe author was drunk but not so much that they couldn't notice the tip being added. So they decided to tip 0% as a response to the bartender adding it without permission. The bartender then threatened to not serve them. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel that the bartender was taking advantage by adding a tip without their knowledge. However, the bartender's job is to serve, and if they expect a certain tip amount, they might feel that a 0% tip is unfair. But the problem is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's consent, which could be seen as deceptive. \n\nSo, the author's action was to respond by not tipping, which might be a reaction to the bartender's unauthorized addition. But is this justifiable? If the tip was added without permission, then the customer has the right to correct it. On the other hand, if the bartender was just using the POS system's default setting, maybe they didn't mean to deceive. However, the bartender's response of refusing service is problematic because threatening not to serve someone over a tip isn't appropriate. \n\nIn terms of responsibility: The bartender should have informed the customer that the tip was being added. The customer, even if drunk, had the right to adjust the tip. The author's response was to remove the tip, which they had the right to do. The bartender's refusal to serve is unprofessional. \n\nSo, putting it together, the author isn't in the wrong because the initial act by the bartender was possibly deceptive, and the customer adjusted accordingly. The bartender's threat is more of an issue. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
