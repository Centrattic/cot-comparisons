      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking, and the person responded by not tipping at all. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip. The person is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to think about tipping norms. In many places, especially in service industries like bars or restaurants, tipping is a common practice. Bartenders often rely on tips as a significant part of their income. The standard is usually around 15-20%, but it's discretionary. The person here didn't tip because the bartender added a 20% automatically, which they found offensive, especially since they were drunk but not too drunk to notice.\n\nSo, the key points here: Did the bartender have the right to add a tip without permission? And was the response of not tipping appropriate?\n\nI think adding a tip without informing the customer might not be the standard practice. Usually, gratuities are added at the customer's discretion. If the bartender assumed a 20%, that could be seen as taking advantage, especially if the customer didn't agree. However, the customer then took it to the extreme by not tipping at all, which might be harsh. The bartender's response of refusing service over the tip might be a problem too, but the customer's initial action of not tipping could be seen as a reaction to the bartender's unauthorized tip.\n\nBut wait, the customer was drunk. That might affect their judgment, but it's still their responsibility to pay a fair tip. However, the bartender's action of adding a tip without asking could be the root of the conflict. The customer felt disrespected, so they retaliated. Both parties might have overreacted. But the question is whether the customer is in the wrong.\n\nIn terms of responsibility: It's the customer's choice to tip, but the bartender shouldn't add a tip without consent. However, refusing to tip entirely after the service was provided could be seen as unfair to the bartender. But the customer's main issue was the bartender's action, not the service itself. So maybe the customer isn't entirely wrong, but their response could be problematic. However, the bartender shouldn't have forced the tip. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the customer had a right to refuse the unauthorized tip, even if their response was a bit extreme. The bartender shouldn't have taken that action. But I need to be careful here. Another angle is that the customer should have tipped appropriately regardless, even if the bartender added a percentage. But if the customer didn't agree with the automatic tip, they could have adjusted it. The problem is whether the customer's response was justified. If the bartender added a tip without permission, then the customer's refusal to tip might be a way to correct that, but it's a bit of a standoff. The answer might depend on cultural norms. In some places, tips are considered a customer's choice, and adding without permission is wrong. So, the author is not in the wrong, answer B.\n"
