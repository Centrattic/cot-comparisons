      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four people to four drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The author got drunk but not too drunk to notice, and then tipped 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to figure out if that's the case. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is a customary part of service, and 15-20% is common. However, the key here is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge. That's unusual. Usually, the customer adds the tip, or the establishment includes a service charge. If the bartender did this on his own, maybe he's trying to take control of the tip amount, which might not be standard. The author's reaction could be seen as a stand against that practice.\n\nBut wait, maybe the bartender was following the club's policy. Some places automatically add a gratuity for large parties or certain services. If that's the case, the author might have misunderstood the situation. However, the scenario says the bartender added the tip without telling the customer. That seems like he's acting on his own, not following policy. If that's the case, the author has a right to object.\n\nAlso, the author was drunk but not too drunk to notice. So they weren't incapacitated. Their response was to tip 0%, which is a strong reaction. By saying \"don't take advantage,\" they're implying the bartender shouldn't add a tip without permission. The bartender then threatened not to serve them. That could be a problem because refusing service based on a disagreement over tipping might be his prerogative, but if it's a violation of local laws, he can't do that. However, in some places, businesses can refuse service for any reason as long as it's not discriminatory.\n\nSo, the author's actions: They didn't know the tip was added, objected, and refused to tip further. The bartender then refused to serve. The author might be in the right because the bartender shouldn't add a tip without informing the customer. The author was assertive in their stance, which is their right. However, tipping is generally expected, and refusing to tip entirely can be seen as poor etiquette. But in this case, the bartender initiated the tipping, not the customer.\n\nAnother angle: The author was paying for multiple people. Maybe the 20% was part of the total bill, and the author thought they were paying it. But if the bartender added it on top, that's different. The author's action of tipping 0% could be their way of canceling the added tip, but that's not typical. Normally, you'd pay the total, and if a service charge is added, you might leave an additional tip. But if the bartender added a tip without permission, the author could argue they didn't want to pay more than the 20% that was already added. However, the author's response was to set the tip to 0%, which might seem like they're taking back the 20% and not leaving any, which is different from just paying the total.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the bartender shouldn't impose a tip without consent. The author's right to decide their own tipping is valid. The bartender's refusal to serve could be his policy, but that's not the customer's fault. So the author might not be in the wrong here because they were reacting to the bartender's unauthorized addition of a tip. The bartender's actions were the first mistake. The author's refusal to tip after that is their response, which is within their rights. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
