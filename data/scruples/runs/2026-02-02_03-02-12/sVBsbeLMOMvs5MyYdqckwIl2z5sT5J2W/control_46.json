      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four people for drinks. The bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The person was drunk but noticed this, responded by tipping 0%, and the bartender refused to serve them if they didn't tip. The person argues that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who's drunk.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, a 15-20% tip is customary for service. However, the key here is that the bartender added the tip without the patron's knowledge. Normally, when you pay with a card, the tip is optional, and you can adjust it. If the bartender added it without asking, that might be an issue of transparency. The patron might feel it's deceptive, especially if they were already under the influence.\n\nThe patron's response was to tip 0%, which could be seen as retaliatory. But why would they do that? They felt the bartender was taking advantage. However, the appropriate action might have been to correct the tip amount after the fact or ask the bartender to remove the added tip. Instead, the patron chose to not tip at all, leading to a confrontation.\n\nBut wait, the bartender threatened not to serve them if they didn't tip. That's a problem because the bartender can't hold someone's money hostage. Refusing to serve because of a tip is against the law in many places. So the bartender is in the wrong for that.\n\nHowever, the question is about the patron's actions. Did they have a right to not tip? If the bartender added the tip without permission, the patron might have the right to remove it. However, the standard expectation is that you do tip. So even if the bartender added it without asking, the patron's response of zero tip might be excessive. They could have adjusted it to a lower amount or just paid the correct amount without adding anything. But refusing to tip at all could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the service was good.\n\nAnother angle: the patron was drunk. Being under the influence might have affected their judgment, but it's not an excuse for the bartender's behavior. The bartender should handle such situations professionally without threatening service.\n\nIn summary, the bartender did the wrong thing by adding a tip without permission and threatening service. The patron's action of not tipping is a reaction to that, but the standard expectation is to tip. However, the patron might not be entirely at fault because the bartender's actions were inappropriate. It's a bit of a gray area, but the main issue is the bartender's approach. The patron might have handled it better by adjusting the tip rather than zeroing it out. But considering the bartender's threat, the patron's response could be seen as justified in self-defense to avoid being overcharged, especially when drunk. So the answer could be B (not in the wrong), but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
