      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about not tipping a bartender who added a 20% tip without asking.\n\nFirst, I need to recall common tipping etiquette. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for services like restaurants and bars. The standard is usually around 15-20%, but it's not automatic. If the bartender added the tip without checking, that's a bit unusual. Normally, the customer should choose the tip amount unless it's a service charge added by the establishment, which is different.\n\nThe author was with friends, inviting them to drinks. The key point is that the bartender added the tip without informing them. The author, being drunk but not too drunk to notice, decided to tip 0% in response. The bartender then refused to serve unless they tipped.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong. Let's break it down. The bartender's action of adding a tip without consent might be the issue. Tipping is supposed to be voluntary, so if the bartender assumed a 20% tip without asking, that's not right. The author's reaction of not tipping could be a response to that perceived overreach. However, refusing to tip at all might be considered inconsiderate, especially if the author was willing to tip an appropriate amount.\n\nBut wait, the author says they were willing to tip an appropriate amount themselves. So maybe they thought the bartender was taking advantage by adding the tip without consent. In that case, the author's zero tip was a protest. However, in some places, it's possible that the bartender was just using a default setting, and the customer is still expected to tip. But if the bartender didn't inform them, that's a problem.\n\nAlso, the bartender's response of refusing service if they don't tip could be an issue. If the establishment has a policy, the author might not be wrong in standing their ground. But in most places, tipping is not mandatory, and refusing service for not tipping could be problematic. However, the bartender is an individual, so maybe the establishment's policy allows for that.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's main issue was the bartender adding a tip without permission. The author's reaction of not tipping could be seen as a justified response to the bartender's overstepping. However, the zero tip is harsh. Maybe a better approach would be to tip the amount they wanted but not the 20% the bartender tried to add. But the author's action was to set it to 0, which might be seen as wrong because they didn't tip at all. Alternatively, if the bartender was just using a default setting, the author could have adjusted it, but the author's protest might be valid.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at both sides. The bartender shouldn't have added the tip without asking, which is inconsiderate. The author's response of not tipping because of that might be understandable, but leaving zero could be seen as not tipping at all, which is usually frowned upon unless there's a very good reason. However, the author was responding to the bartender's action. The key here is that the bartender's action was the root of the problem. So the author might not be in the wrong because the bartender started it. The answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
