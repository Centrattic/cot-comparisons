      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not tipping the bartender after he added a 20% tip without asking. The user went to a club, bought four friends drinks, and when paying, the bartender put in a 20% tip. The author was drunk but noticed this and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip. The user is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the usual tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, it's customary to tip around 15-20% for good service. So if the bartender added 20% automatically, maybe that's standard practice for the establishment. But the key issue here is that the bartender didn't inform the customer before adding the tip. Normally, when a service is tipped, the customer should have control over the amount. If the server adds a tip without asking, that could be problematic.\n\nThe author was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They felt the bartender was taking advantage, so they zeroed out the tip. The bartender responded by threatening not to serve them. Now, is the author wrong for doing that?\n\nI think tipping is a customer's choice. If a restaurant or bar has an automatic gratuity policy, they should inform the customer. The fact that the bartender did this without telling the author might be the real issue here. The author might have felt disrespected or misled. However, responding by not tipping at all could be seen as a reaction, but maybe the appropriate action would be to confront the manager or discuss the policy rather than just refusing service.\n\nBut the bartender's response of not serving them if they didn't tip seems aggressive. Bartenders shouldn't threaten customers. However, the author's initial action of not tipping after the bartender added a tip might conflict with standard practices. If the author wanted to tip an appropriate amount themselves, maybe they should have adjusted the tip to the correct amount instead of removing it entirely. But if the policy is to add a tip automatically, the customer might feel it's unfair to be forced to pay extra without consent.\n\nIn some places, automatic gratuity is allowed, but it's usually disclosed on the menu or at the time of service. If the bartender didn't inform the customer, the bar might be at fault for not having clear policies. However, the customer's reaction of refusing to tip could be seen as their right, especially if they felt coerced. But not tipping in a place where tipping is expected is generally frowned upon, unless there's a specific reason like poor service. The author didn't mention poor service, just the automatic tip.\n\nSo, the author might not be at fault for objecting to an automatic tip without consent. The bartender's response was unprofessional. However, the author could have handled it differently, like asking for the tip to be removed and then tipping appropriately. Not tipping at all might be seen as a mistake because it goes against the usual social norm, but the initial action of the bartender was also problematic. The blame might be shared, but since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might hinge on whether the bartender's action was acceptable and if the author's response was justified.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is at fault because they didn't tip at all, regardless of the bartender's actions. But if the bartender's action was against standard practice, then the author is just exercising their right. It's a bit of a gray area. But since the bartender added the tip without consent, the author might have a valid reason to refuse.\n"
