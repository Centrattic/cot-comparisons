      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this situation. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. Let me break down the details.\n\nSo, the person went to a club with friends and invited four friends to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The person was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They responded by tipping 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip. The person was willing to tip an appropriate amount but was upset about the bartender adding the tip without asking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the service industry, tipping is expected and often considered part of the service worker's income. However, the way the tip was added here is questionable. If the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge, that's a problem. The customer has the right to know how their money is being handled. The bartender should have asked for consent before adding the tip, even if it's standard practice in some places.\n\nThe person was drunk but not incapacitated. They could still understand the situation. However, their reaction of tipping 0% and confronting the bartender might be seen as aggressive. The person felt that the bartender was taking advantage, which is a valid concern if the tip wasn't disclosed. The bartender's response of refusing to serve them further if they didn't tip is also problematic. Threatening not to serve someone over a tip could be seen as inappropriate, as the customer has the right to decide how much to tip, even if they are wrong.\n\nSo, who's at fault here? The bartender's initial action of adding the tip without consent is the first issue. Then, the person's response of not tipping and confronting the bartender is a reaction to that. However, the person could have handled it differently, like asking the bartender to remove the tip or discussing it politely. Instead, the confrontation led to the bartender refusing service, which escalates the conflict.\n\nIn conclusion, both parties have some responsibility. The bartender shouldn't have added the tip without informing the customer, and the person could have addressed the issue without tipping 0% and being confrontational. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the main point is that the bartender's actions were the initial problem. The person was within their right to tip as they see fit, but their approach might have been harsh. However, the bartender's threat to not serve them is also a significant point. Given that, the person might not be entirely at fault, but there's a nuance here. The answer might depend on cultural norms around tipping and whether pre-adding tips is standard in that area. If it's standard, then the person's reaction might be less justified. But if it's not standard, the bartender is at fault. Given the information, I think the author isn't entirely in the wrong, so the answer would be B.\n"
