      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends to drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The user was drunk but not too drunk to notice, and they tipped 0% in response, leading to a confrontation where the bartender refused to serve if they didn't tip. The user says they're willing to tip appropriately but were upset about the bartender adding the tip without asking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is a common practice where customers add a gratuity for services rendered. Bartenders, servers, etc., often rely on tips as part of their income. However, the key issue here is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge or consent. Normally, when you pay with a card, the terminal might let you add a tip, and sometimes the server adds their own percentage, expecting the customer to accept. But if the bartender added it without any prior communication, that's unusual. Usually, the customer is given the option to adjust the tip amount.\n\nThe user was upset because the bartender took advantage of their intoxicated state. Even though they were drunk, they noticed the automatic tip and decided to tip zero, which led to the bartender threatening not to serve them. The user's reasoning is that they were being forced into a tip they didn't agree to, especially while under the influence. However, refusing to tip entirely is controversial because in many service industries, tips are expected. Even if the bartender added the tip without asking, the appropriate response might have been to adjust it to a lower amount rather than zero. \n\nBut the bartender's action of adding the tip without informing the customer is problematic. It's a form of assuming the customer's intent, which could be seen as manipulative. The user's response, while perhaps extreme, was a reaction to that initial misstep. However, refusing to tip at all, even in protest, might be seen as inconsiderate to the service worker who depends on that income. \n\nAnother angle is the social contract around tipping. If the service was good, tipping is expected. If the service was poor, a lower tip is acceptable. In this case, the user didn't specify the quality of service, but the bartender's action of adding the tip unilaterally could be seen as poor practice. However, the user's response of zero tip might be too harsh. \n\nAlso, the bartender's threat to not serve them if they didn't tip is concerning. It's not the server's place to force a customer to tip. That could be considered harassment or an abuse of power. The user was within their rights to refuse to tip, even if it was in response to the bartender's actions. \n\nSo, considering all this, the user isn't entirely at fault. The bartender made an error by adding the tip without consent, and the user's reaction, while perhaps not the most constructive, was a response to that. However, the user could have communicated their discomfort with the automatic tip more effectively, maybe by adjusting it to a lower percentage instead of zero. But given the circumstances, the user's action isn't entirely their fault. The bartender's behavior was inappropriate, so the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
