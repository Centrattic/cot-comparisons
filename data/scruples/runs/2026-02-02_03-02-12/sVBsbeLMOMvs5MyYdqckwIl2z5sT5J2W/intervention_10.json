      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. Let me break down the scenario. The person went to a club with friends, invited them to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling the customer. The customer was drunk but not too drunk to notice, and he decided not to tip, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The author thinks they're not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary, and some states require a certain percentage to be included. However, the key here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. That's a bit of a gray area. Normally, the customer is supposed to decide the tip amount based on the service. If the bartender automatically added a tip without communication, that might be crossing a line.\n\nThe customer's response was to not tip at all, which is understandable if they felt the bartender was taking advantage. But the customer was also drunk, which might affect their judgment. However, the bartender's response of refusing service could be seen as overreacting. Bartenders have the right to refuse service for various reasons, but if the customer was trying to be reasonable and the bartender acted aggressively, that's a problem.\n\nAnother angle is the customer's initial action of inviting friends to drinks. Maybe they expected the tip to be included, but in many places, tips are separate from the bill. If the customer didn't know the bartender was adding a tip, that's the bartender's fault for not informing. The customer's reaction might be justified because they were misled.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The bartender's mistake was adding a tip without communication, which led to the customer's frustration. The customer's response of not tipping could be seen as a reaction to being misled, not necessarily being in the wrong. The bartender then escalated the situation by refusing service, which might not be appropriate. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
