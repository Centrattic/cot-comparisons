      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user went to a club with friends, invited four of them for four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The user, who was drunk but not too drunk, noticed and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The user claims they wanted to tip an appropriate amount but the bartender adding the tip without permission upset them. They're asking if they're in the wrong (AITA).\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The user was drunk but functional enough to notice the bartender adding the tip. The bartender didn't inform them about the tip being added. The user responded by not tipping, leading to a confrontation where the bartender refused service. The user's reasoning was that the bartender shouldn't assume a tip amount without consent, especially when the customer is intoxicated.\n\nNow, in terms of standard tipping practices, in many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected and often considered part of the service industry workers' pay. However, some places might automatically add a service charge for groups or events, which is different from an individual tip. The user might have been confused between a service charge and a personal tip. But in this case, the bartender added 20% as a tip, not as a service charge. The user's response of not tipping could be seen as a protest against that action.\n\nThe user's argument is that the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without their knowledge, especially since they were drunk. The user felt that the bartender was taking advantage of their state. However, the bartender's role is to process the payment, and adding a tip is a common practice, even if it's standard. If the user didn't want to tip, they could have adjusted it, but they chose to leave 0%, which might be considered rude or against expectations.\n\nAnother angle is the bartender's refusal to serve them. If the bartender is within their rights to require a tip to serve, then the user might be in the wrong for not complying. However, in some places, refusing service based on the tip amount could be problematic, as tipping is a customer's choice. But in other contexts, especially in private businesses, they can set their own policies, like requiring a minimum tip or not serving those who don't tip.\n\nThe user's justification is that the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without permission. But typically, when you pay with a card, especially with a point-of-sale system, sometimes the merchant can pre-select a tip amount. The customer is then supposed to adjust it if necessary. In this case, the user noticed and changed it to 0%. However, the bartender might have expected a tip and was offended by the user's response.\n\nThe user was drunk, which complicates things. Being under the influence might lead to more emotional reactions. The user's statement about not letting drunk people be taken advantage of is a bit ironic if they were the one causing a scene. However, the bartender's action might have been the initial issue, adding the tip without consent.\n\nIn terms of social norms, tipping is a cultural expectation, and not tipping can be seen as disrespectful. The user's response of 0% is a strong statement and could be seen as inconsiderate. The bartender's reaction of refusing service might be a business decision, but it's also possible that the user's actions were a justified protest against an automatic tip that wasn't their choice.\n\nSo, considering all this, the user might not be in the wrong if the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without consent. But if tipping is expected and the user's refusal is a violation of that expectation, then they might be in the wrong. The key is whether the bartender had the right to add the tip without asking. If the user had the option to adjust it and did so, but the bartender then refused service, the user might still be in the right if they felt the initial action was wrong.\n\nI think the answer hinges on the expectation of tipping and whether the bartender overstepped by adding it without notice. If the user is in a place where tipping is expected, not tipping could be seen as wrong, but if the bartender shouldn't impose a tip without the customer's knowledge, then the user isn't in the wrong. The user's decision to not tip and confront the bartender might be a valid choice, leading to the bartender's refusal to serve. In that case, the user isn't in the wrong because they're standing up for their right to choose how much to tip.\n"
