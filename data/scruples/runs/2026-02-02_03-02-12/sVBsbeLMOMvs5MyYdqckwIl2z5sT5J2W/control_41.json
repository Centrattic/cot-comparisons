      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four people for drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The person was drunk but noticed this and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The user is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the typical tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, it's customary to tip service workers around 15-20%. However, this is usually the customer's choice. The bartender added the tip without asking, which the customer took issue with. The customer's response was to not tip at all, leading to a confrontation.\n\nSo, is the customer in the wrong? Well, the key points are: the bartender added a tip without permission, the customer was drunk but not too drunk to notice, and the customer refused to tip. The bartender's response was to refuse service if they didn't tip. \n\nFrom a service industry perspective, adding a tip without the customer's consent might be unusual. Typically, tips are left at the customer's discretion. If the bartender added 20% automatically, that could be seen as a policy of the establishment, but the customer might not be aware. However, the customer then decided to not tip, which could be a reaction to the bartender's action. But refusing to tip entirely when the bartender was already adding a tip might be problematic. Even if the customer is upset, not tipping at all could be seen as a harsh response. \n\nOn the other hand, the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without consent. The customer has the right to decide how much to tip, even if they're drunk. But refusing to tip because the bartender added a tip could be a misunderstanding. Maybe the bartender was just following a policy, and the customer didn't know. However, the customer's decision to not tip in response to the bartender's action might be seen as their choice, but in the service industry, tips are a significant part of income. Refusing to tip could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the bartender provided good service. \n\nBut the situation is a bit of a conflict. The bartender's action of adding the tip without asking was probably not appropriate. The customer's response, while perhaps understandable given the situation, might be extreme. However, if the bartender was just following a policy, maybe the customer's reaction is misplaced. \n\nIn many places, it's common for establishments to add a service charge (like for large parties or events), but for an individual customer, automatically adding a tip without notification isn't standard. So the bartender's action could be at fault. The customer's response of not tipping in return might be a form of protest, but it's possible that the customer is not in the wrong here because the bartender initiated the problematic action. \n\nHowever, the bartender's refusal to serve if they don't tip is also an issue. Employees shouldn't dictate how much a customer tips, even if they're upset. The customer has the right to pay the bill without tipping, but the bartender can't refuse service over a tip. That part might be outside of the customer's control. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the customer's decision to not tip after the bartender added a tip without consent might not be entirely their fault. The bartender's actions were inappropriate, and the customer was reacting to that. However, refusing to tip entirely could be seen as inconsiderate, but the main issue was the bartender's unauthorized addition. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the customer not being in the wrong. But there's a nuance here. If the customer was drunk and made a hasty decision, maybe they should have handled it differently. But the bartender's action was the initial problem. \n\nIn conclusion, the customer might not be at fault because the bartender added the tip without permission, and the customer's response, while possibly impulsive, was a reaction to that. The bartender shouldn't have done that, and the customer's right to choose their tip is important. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
