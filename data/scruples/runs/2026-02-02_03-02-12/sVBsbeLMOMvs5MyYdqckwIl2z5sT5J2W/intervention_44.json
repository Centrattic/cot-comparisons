      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for not tipping the bartender. Here's the situation: they went to a club with friends, invited four of them for drinks. The bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The person was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They decided to tip 0% because they didn't like the bartender adding the tip without permission. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip. The person thought they're not wrong, but wants to know the community's take.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the bartender adding a tip automatically without telling the customer. In many places, tips are supposed to be optional, even though in the service industry, especially in places like bars and restaurants, tipping is customary. However, the act of adding a tip without the customer's knowledge or consent could be problematic. It's possible the bartender is trying to enforce a tip policy, but if it's done without transparency, that's an issue.\n\nThe customer felt wronged because the bartender took advantage. The person's response was to leave 0%, which is within their right since tips are voluntary. However, the bartender then refused service, which might not be allowed. In some places, businesses can't force a tip, so refusing service for not tipping might be against the law. But that depends on local laws. \n\nThe person was drunk but not incapacitated. They made a conscious decision not to tip after the bartender's action made them uncomfortable. The bartender's threat to not serve them again could be seen as unprofessional. The customer's actions were a reaction to the bartender's behavior, which they found unethical. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong. From a legal standpoint, if the law allows for voluntary tipping and prohibits forced tips or service refusal, then the bartender overstepped. Ethically, the customer's decision to withhold a tip because the bartender added it without permission is defensible. However, in some cultures, tipping is expected, and not tipping could be seen as rude. But in this case, the bartender's actions might have justified the customer's response. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the bartender's actions were inappropriate, and the customer had the right to respond as they did.\n"
