      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip their bartender is at fault. The situation is that the person invited four friends to a club and ordered drinks for them. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The user, who was drunk but not too drunk to notice, decided to tip 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The user is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the standard practice regarding tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for service staff, including bartenders. Typically, a 15-20% tip is considered appropriate. However, the bartender in this case added the tip without asking the customer, which might be unusual. Normally, the customer is expected to decide the tip amount based on the service. The bartender's action could be seen as taking initiative, but it's not standard to add a tip without the customer's knowledge.\n\nThe user was drunk but not to the point of being unaware. They noticed the bartender adding the tip and chose to tip 0% as a response. This might come across as confrontational. The bartender's refusal to serve them could be a result of the customer's response. Bartenders rely on tips as part of their income, so expecting them to add a tip without the customer's input might not be the right approach, but the customer's reaction of zero tipping could be seen as retaliatory rather than addressing the issue constructively.\n\nAnother angle: the user might not have known that the bartender expected a tip. However, in most cultures, tipping is an understood part of the service. If the bartender added a tip without informing, maybe the user should have adjusted the amount if they felt it was excessive. Alternatively, the bartender shouldn't have assumed the tip amount without the customer's input.\n\nThe user's argument is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who's drunk. However, the user didn't ask to have the tip removed or discuss it calmly; instead, they retaliated by removing the tip entirely. The bartender then refused to serve, which could be a policy of the establishment. The user might be at fault because they didn't address the issue in a way that respects the bartender's livelihood. The bartender, on the other hand, shouldn't have added a tip without the customer's consent, but the user's response was extreme.\n\nIn conclusion, both parties might have some fault. However, the user's action of tipping 0% in response to the bartender's mistake could be seen as inconsiderate. The bartender should have asked for confirmation before adding the tip, but the user didn't handle it politely. The user's AITA might be B (not in the wrong) because the bartender shouldn't have made the assumption, but there's a case for the user needing to communicate better. However, the user's response was to zero tip, which is harsh. So, maybe the user is at fault for not handling it more professionally.\n"
