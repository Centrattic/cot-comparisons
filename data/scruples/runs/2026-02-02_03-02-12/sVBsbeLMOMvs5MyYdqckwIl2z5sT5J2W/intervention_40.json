      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four people to drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The user, who was drunk but not too drunk, decided to tip 0% because they didn't want the bartender to take advantage of them. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The user is asking if they're at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for services like bartending. The standard is usually 15-20%, so the bartender adding 20% might have been in line with that. However, the key issue here is that the bartender didn't inform the customer before adding the tip. That could be a problem because the customer wasn't given a choice.\n\nThe user felt the bartender was taking advantage by adding the tip without their consent. They responded by not tipping at all, which the bartender took as a refusal to pay, leading to the refusal to serve. Now, the question is whether the user was wrong in this action.\n\nOn one hand, not tipping could be seen as rude or against the expected social norm. Bartenders rely on tips as part of their income, so refusing to tip might be considered disrespectful. On the other hand, the bartender's action of adding a tip without informing the customer could be viewed as deceptive or manipulative, especially if the customer was under the influence. The user's response was a refusal to comply with the unauthorized tip, which might be justified if they felt coerced or if the bartender overstepped by adding the tip without permission.\n\nAnother angle is the right of the establishment to automatically add a gratuity. Some places do this for large parties or as a policy, but it's usually disclosed. If the bartender did this on his own without the restaurant's policy backing it up, the customer might have a valid reason to object. However, in some regions, automatic gratuities are allowed, so the bartender might have followed a standard practice.\n\nThe user's argument that they were drunk but not too drunk to notice the tip being added is important. If they had the capacity to understand what was happening, then their refusal to tip could be seen as a conscious choice, possibly out of spite. However, the bartender's refusal to serve them after the conflict might have escalated the situation inappropriately.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the user is in the wrong depends on the context. If the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge, the user's reaction is understandable. However, the refusal to tip at all, even if the bartender had a policy, could be seen as disrespectful. But if the bartender acted unilaterally and the user was merely objecting to unauthorized charges, the user might not be in the wrong. The answer might hinge on whether the tip was added as per the establishment's policy or the bartender's personal decision.\n"
