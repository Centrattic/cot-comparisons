      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that the person went out with friends, invited four friends to four drinks each, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The person then tipped 0%, told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people, and the bartender refused service if they didn't tip. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is a common practice where the customer adds a percentage to the bill for service. The expected amount can vary, but 15-20% is typical. The author was drunk but not too drunk to notice the bartender adding the tip. The key point here is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge or consent. Normally, if a tip is added automatically, it's usually pre-authorized or the customer is informed. The author's reaction was to not tip at all, which led to a confrontation.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the bartender added the tip without consent, the author has a right to object. However, the appropriate response would be to remove the tip or adjust it, rather than leaving zero. But the author felt wronged because the bartender took advantage of their possible intoxication. The bartender's response of refusing service if they didn't tip is also questionable, as it could be seen as coercion. \n\nIn some places, automatic gratuity can be added if the service is good, but the customer must be informed. The author's action of leaving zero might be seen as a strong reaction, but the bartender's behavior of adding the tip without consent is also problematic. The author's responsibility is to check the bill and adjust the tip as they see fit. So, while the author's response was harsh, the initial action by the bartender was also inappropriate. Therefore, the author isn't entirely at fault. The answer leans towards B (No), but with some nuance.\n"
