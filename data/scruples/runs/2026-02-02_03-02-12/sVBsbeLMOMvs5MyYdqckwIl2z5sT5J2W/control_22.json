      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The scenario is that the person went to a club with friends, invited four friends for drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The person got drunk but wasn't too drunk to notice, so they decided not to tip at all, telling the bartender not to take advantage. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip. The user wants to know if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the norms around tipping in the US. Tipping is customary in many service industries, including bartending. Typically, a 15-20% tip is considered standard. However, the key here is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge. That's a bit of an issue because customers usually expect transparency. If the bartender automatically added the tip without informing them, especially in a situation where the customer might be less aware due to drinking, that could be problematic.\n\nThe customer was drunk but not too much to notice the bartender's action. They decided not to tip because they felt the bartender was taking advantage. The bartender then refused service if they didn't tip. Now, in some places, tipping is expected as part of the service cost, but it's also supposed to be voluntary. If the restaurant or bar automatically adds a tip without disclosure, that might be against the law in some states. For example, California requires that automatic gratuities be disclosed on the bill. If the bartender didn't do that, the customer might have a right to object.\n\nHowever, the customer's response of giving 0% could be seen as extreme because even if there was an issue with the automatic tip, the appropriate action might be to adjust the tip to a lower amount rather than none. But the customer's reasoning is that the bartender was trying to take advantage, so they refused to tip as a form of protest. \n\nThe bartender's response of refusing service if they don't tip is also a point. In some places, refusing service because a customer doesn't tip could be illegal or against business practices. Tipping is supposed to be voluntary, and businesses can't compel customers to tip. However, in practice, many establishments do require tipping, especially in places where tips make up a significant portion of the staff's income. But if the customer was in a situation where the bartender added the tip without permission, then the customer's refusal to pay that might be justified.\n\nSo, considering all this, the customer might not be entirely at fault. The bartender's action of adding the tip without consent is the first issue. The customer's reaction, while perhaps extreme, is a response to that. The customer did want to pay an appropriate amount but was upset by the bartender's unilateral decision. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
