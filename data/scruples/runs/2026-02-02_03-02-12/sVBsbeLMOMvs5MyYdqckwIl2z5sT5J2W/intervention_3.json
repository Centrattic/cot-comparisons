      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that the author went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without consulting them. The author was drunk but not too drunk to notice this, so they left a 0% tip, told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people, and the bartender refused to serve them. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the customary tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, it's common to tip service workers like bartenders 15-20%, sometimes more. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge. Normally, the customer is supposed to decide the tip amount, not the server. So if the bartender unilaterally added a tip, that could be seen as going against standard practice where the customer has autonomy over their tip.\n\nThen there's the author's reaction. They left a 0% tip, which is not customary, but given the bartender's action, maybe the author felt justified. The author was drunk but not too drunk to make a decision. The bartender's response was to refuse service, which could be a problem because refusing service based on the tip amount might be against the law in some places. However, bartenders often have policies or agreements with the establishment about how tips are handled. If the club doesn't allow that, the bartender might not have the authority to refuse service.\n\nAlso, the author invited friends to drinks, which might be a social gesture, but if they paid for four drinks, maybe the total bill wasn't extremely high. The added 20% could be a standard gratuity for the venue, but if that's not communicated properly, it's a problem. The author's decision to leave 0% as a reaction to the bartender's action might be seen as a justified protest, especially if the tip was added without consent.\n\nAnother angle: in some places, it's illegal for businesses to automatically add a tip without the customer's consent. If that's the case here, the bartender overstepped, and the author's refusal to pay it could be valid. The author's response, while not customary in tipping practices, might be a reaction to an unfair practice. The bartender's refusal to serve could be a policy issue; maybe the club's policy allows employees to refuse service under certain conditions, but that's a separate matter.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's actions were a response to the bartender's unilaterally added tip. If the bartender shouldn't have done that, then the author isn't in the wrong for not paying the tip. However, the author's choice to leave 0% is not typical, but given the circumstances, it's a reasonable reaction. The bartender's refusal to serve might be a separate issue, possibly a violation of service policies, but the core question is about the author's responsibility for not tipping. Since the bartender added the tip without consent, the author's decision not to tip in response isn't necessarily wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
