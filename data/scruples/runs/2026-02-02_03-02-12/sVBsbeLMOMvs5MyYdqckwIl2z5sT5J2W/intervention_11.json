      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the bartender was in the wrong. The situation is a bit specific. So, they went to a club with friends, invited four friends to have four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The person got drunk but noticed the bartender adding the tip, then tipped 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip. The person was willing to tip an appropriate amount but was upset about the bartender adding the tip without permission.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the etiquette around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected in service industries like bars. The usual range is 15-20%, but it's supposed to be the customer's choice. If the bartender added a tip without asking, that's a problem. The customer has the right to decide how much to tip. The bartender shouldn't impose their own tip, especially without consent. So the person might have a valid reason to be upset. \n\nBut wait, some places automatically add a gratuity, especially for large groups or events. However, this was a group of friends, not a large party. Maybe the bartender thought it was standard, but the key issue here is that he didn't inform them. The customer's right to choose their tip is being violated. \n\nThe customer was drunk but not too drunk to notice the bartender's action. They reacted by tipping 0%, which might be extreme, but the bartender's approach was wrong. The customer's response was a bit confrontational, but maybe justified given the bartender's actions. The bartender then threatening to not serve them could be seen as overreacting. \n\nSo, the person's actions: they didn't tip because the bartender added the tip without permission. The bartender's actions: adding a tip without informing the customer. In this case, the person isn't in the wrong because the bartender acted improperly. The customer had the right to refuse the added tip and decide their own amount. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
