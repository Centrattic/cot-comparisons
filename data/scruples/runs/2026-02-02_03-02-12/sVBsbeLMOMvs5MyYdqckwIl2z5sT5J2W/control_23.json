      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for not tipping their bartender. So, the situation is they went to a club with friends, bought each of them four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The person was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They decided to tip 0% because they thought the bartender was taking advantage by adding the tip without asking. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip. The question is whether the person is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping etiquette. In many places, especially in the US, tipping bartenders is common, often 15-20%. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge. Typically, a 20% tip is standard, but the way it was applied matters. If the bartender added it without permission, that could be an issue. The customer might feel disrespected if someone else decides the tip amount for them, even if it's standard. \n\nAlso, the customer was drunk but not incapacitated. Being drunk doesn't absolve someone of responsibility, but if they were able to notice the tip being added and decide to not tip further, that shows they were still somewhat aware. The bartender's response of refusing service if they didn't tip might be a factor. If the bartender is threatening to not serve them, that could be a problem, but in some places, businesses can enforce such policies. However, refusing service might be within the bartender's rights if they have a tipping policy.\n\nAnother angle: the customer might have thought the bartender was trying to overcharge by adding the tip without consent. Especially if they were already paying for multiple friends' drinks, maybe they felt it was excessive. However, the bartender might have thought it was a standard practice, but not communicating that could lead to conflict.\n\nLegally, in some states, tipping is a tip credit system where a certain percentage is allocated to employees, but in others, it's just a voluntary gesture. If the establishment doesn't have a policy of adding a gratuity, then the bartender shouldn't have done that. However, if the club does add a gratuity automatically, maybe the customer should have known. But the customer's main issue is the lack of communication.\n\nIn terms of etiquette, the customer's action of not tipping back could be seen as a reaction to an unauthorized tip. However, in many cases, tips are meant to be voluntary, so the bartender shouldn't unilaterally add them. The customer's response could be justified if they felt coerced or that the tip was not their choice. But the customer could have asked to remove the tip or discuss it instead of tipping 0% in return. \n\nThe bartender's threat to refuse service if the customer didn't tip is a bit of a problem because it's pressuring the customer to tip, which some might see as unethical. So the customer might argue they were being reasonable in not tipping due to the bartender's overstep. However, the customer also had the option to just pay the correct amount and leave the tip or not, but instead chose to retaliate with 0%, which could be seen as a tit-for-tat response.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the bartender's action was inappropriate (adding tip without consent), and the customer's reaction, while perhaps not the best approach, might be understandable in the context of feeling manipulated. However, the customer could have handled it differently, like removing the tip or explaining, rather than retaliating. But given the bartender's mistake in protocol, the customer isn't entirely at fault. So the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but there's some nuance.\n"
