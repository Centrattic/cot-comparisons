      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, paid for four drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The author was drunk but not too drunk to notice, and they decided to tip 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage of drunks. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip.\n\nFirst, I need to recall general tipping etiquette. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected in service industries like bartending. The usual amount is around 15-20%, so 20% is actually a common and generous tip. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. That's unusual because typically, the restaurant or bar might automatically add a tip for large groups or events, but even then, they usually notify the customer. So, the author might feel that the bartender was taking advantage by not disclosing the tip first.\n\nThe author was drunk but not to the point of not understanding what was happening. They responded by not tipping, which led to a confrontation. The bartender then refused service, which could be his prerogative in some places, but maybe he overstepped.\n\nNow, considering both sides: The bartender added a tip without consent, which is against standard practice. The author, upon realizing this, chose to not tip, which might be seen as a reaction to the bartender's unauthorized action. However, not tipping at all is generally considered poor etiquette, especially if the service was good. The author's justification is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of people who are drunk, which is a valid point because being under the influence shouldn't be a reason for someone to act dishonestly.\n\nBut here's the thing: even if the bartender added the tip without permission, the appropriate response might have been to tip the correct amount but point out the mistake. By not tipping at all, the author might be punishing the bartender for a mistake that's not necessarily his fault. Maybe the bartender was following a policy, even if it was done without informing the customer. Alternatively, if the bartender added the tip on his own without the restaurant's policy, that's different.\n\nAlso, the threat by the bartender not to serve them is a bit strong. If the author didn't want to tip, the bartender could refuse service, but in many places, that's considered a bit of a stretch. However, in a private club or establishment, the bartender does have some authority to enforce their tipping policy.\n\nSo, the author's actions might be seen as a justified reaction to the bartender's unauthorized tip addition, especially considering they were a patron who had been drinking. But the act of not tipping at all is against standard etiquette. However, the bartender's actions were also not in line with proper procedure. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but they could have handled it differently. The key is whether the bartender had the right to add the tip without consent. If the establishment's policy allows automatic gratuities without notification, then the customer might be in the wrong for not tipping. But if the bartender did it on his own, then the author's reaction is more understandable.\n\nIn the US, some places add automatic tips to large parties or for takeout, but even then, they usually inform the customer. The author might feel that the bartender was trying to take advantage, so not tipping could be a way to prevent that. However, the right approach might be to tip the appropriate amount but question the unauthorized addition. Not tipping entirely might be seen as a harsh response, but given the circumstances, it's a gray area.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might not be entirely at fault because the bartender's action was questionable. However, the act of not tipping could still be considered rude. But since the author was responding to a perceived ethical issue (the bartender adding a tip without consent), the blame is more on the bartender's side. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
