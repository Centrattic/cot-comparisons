      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. So the scenario is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The author was drunk but noticed and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip. The author says they wanted to tip appropriately but the bartender adding the tip without informing them was a problem.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points here. Tipping practices can vary by culture and establishment. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for service staff like bartenders. However, some places may automatically add a service charge, but usually, that's for large groups or events, not individual customers. The author was with a group of four friends, so maybe the bartender considered it a group and applied a service charge. But the issue is that the bartender did this without informing the customer.\n\nThe author was drunk but not so much that they couldn't notice the tip being added. They responded by leaving a 0% tip, possibly out of protest. The bartender then threatened not to serve them unless they tipped. The author's reasoning is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of drunk people, implying that the automatic tip was an unfair practice. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, in terms of social norms, tipping is expected in many service industries. If the bartender added a tip without permission, that might be against the establishment's policy, but the customer's responsibility is to tip appropriately. However, the author's response of refusing to tip after the bartender added it might be seen as confrontational. But the bartender's action of adding the tip without consent could be problematic. \n\nSome might argue that the bartender's job is to manage the register, and if there's a default tip set, that's part of the business's policy. If the business allows bartenders to add tips automatically without informing customers, that's an issue. However, as a customer, expecting to tip is part of the service. The author's response of 0% might be seen as a protest against the bartender's action, but refusing to tip in general could be considered rude or against the cultural norm, hence making the author at fault.\n\nOn the other hand, if the bartender didn't inform the customer about the tip, that's a breach of trust. The author might feel that they were being overcharged without their knowledge, especially while drunk. The bartender threatening not to serve them could be seen as a conflict of interest. \n\nSo the key factors are: was the automatic tip part of the business's policy (which should be communicated to customers), and the author's response of not tipping. If the tip was added without permission, the bartender might be at fault, but the customer's refusal to tip could also be seen as inconsiderate. However, in many cultures, tipping is expected, so the customer's refusal might be the main issue here. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not tipping, even if the bartender's action was questionable.\n"
