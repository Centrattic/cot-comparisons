      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the bartender is in the wrong. The scenario is that they went to a club with friends, bought 4 drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The author was drunk but not too drunk to notice, and then decided to tip 0% in response, leading the bartender to refuse service.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, a 15-20% tip is customary for service workers. However, the key issue here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. That's a problem because the customer should have control over their own tipping, regardless of the establishment's policy. Adding a tip without consent can be seen as a way to pressure customers into tipping more, which is ethically questionable.\n\nThe author was already paying for their friends' drinks, which might be a social context where tipping expectations are different. Maybe the author felt it was a group decision, but the bartender's action of adding 20% without notice could have been perceived as taking advantage, especially when the customer was under the influence. The author's response of 0% was a direct reaction to that. However, refusing to tip at all is a strong move, even if the bartender was at fault for adding the tip without consent.\n\nBut the author might not be in the wrong because they were reacting to an unauthorized addition. The bartender's refusal to serve them after the author's 0% tip could be seen as disproportionate. If the author was willing to tip an appropriate amount but was angered by the bartender's actions, then perhaps the author isn't at fault. However, some might argue that even if the bartender added the tip without asking, the customer should still tip, just not as a high percentage.\n\nAnother angle is the social norm of tipping, which is a personal choice. The author might have felt the 20% was excessive, especially if they were paying for multiple people. But the method of response\u2014tipping 0%\u2014could be seen as harsh. However, the bartender's actions were also questionable. It's a bit of a gray area. The author's decision to not tip in response to the bartender's unauthorized action isn't necessarily wrong, especially if the bartender was trying to coerce them. So, the answer is more likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
