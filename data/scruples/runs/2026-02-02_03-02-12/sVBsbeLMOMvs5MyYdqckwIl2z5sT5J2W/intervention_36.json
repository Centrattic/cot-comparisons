      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong for not tipping their bartender. The story is that they went to a club with friends, invited four people to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling the person. The person was drunk but noticed this and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender he shouldn't take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip. The user thinks the author isn't wrong.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the service industry, tipping is customary and part of the server's income. Bartenders typically rely on tips as a significant portion of their pay. So, the expectation is that customers leave a tip, usually around 15-20%. \n\nNow, in this case, the bartender added a 20% tip automatically. That's not uncommon, especially in places where it's standard. However, the person in the story noticed this and decided to leave 0%, which led to a confrontation. The key points here are the automatic tip, the person's reaction, and the bartender's response.\n\nThe person argues that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of drunk patrons. But the bartender might have just been following standard practice by adding a tip. The person's decision to not tip at all could be seen as going against the norm, especially since they were aware of the tip being added and chose to override it. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the person being drunk. However, being drunk doesn't typically excuse not tipping, especially if they were coherent enough to notice and interact with the bartender. The person's reasoning is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage, but adding a standard tip is part of the business model. \n\nThe bartender's response to not serve them anymore is a bit strong, but it's his right to refuse service if a customer is being difficult or not meeting expected tipping practices. \n\nSo, the question is whether the person is wrong for not tipping. The argument against them is that tipping is expected, and refusing to tip after being aware of the standard practice is inconsiderate. The argument for them is that the bartender added the tip without permission, which might be seen as deceptive, but that's not usually the case since automatic tips are common and part of the total charge. \n\nIn the end, the person did notice the tip and chose to cancel it, which could be seen as a conscious decision not to tip. If they were okay with tipping initially but the bartender added it without asking, that's a problem. However, if the bartender is allowed to add a tip by default, then the person's refusal might not be justified. \n\nSo, considering all that, the person might be in the wrong because they didn't tip when it's customary and the bartender was following standard procedure. The fact that they were drunk doesn't negate the responsibility to tip. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
