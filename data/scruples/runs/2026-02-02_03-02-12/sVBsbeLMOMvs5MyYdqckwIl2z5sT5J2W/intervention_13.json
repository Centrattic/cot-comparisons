      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the person is asking if they're in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The person was drunk but noticed this and responded by leaving 0% tip, telling the bartender not to take advantage. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The person says they wanted to tip appropriately but the bartender adding it without consent made them upset.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the usual tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is part of the service industry's income. Bartenders often rely on tips. But the key here is that the bartender added a tip without asking or informing the customer. Normally, when you pay with a card, sometimes the system may prompt for a tip, but if the bartender manually adds it without the customer's knowledge, that's different. The customer had the right to tip as they saw fit. \n\nThe person was drunk but not too drunk to notice the bartender's action. They felt the bartender was taking advantage and responded by not tipping. The bartender then refused service. So, the person is asking if they're at fault here.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the customer's action was to reject an unauthorized tip. The bartender added a tip that wasn't agreed upon. The customer's response was to not tip in return, which the bartender then used as a threat. I think the bartender's action was wrong to add the tip unilaterally. The customer was within their rights to decide how much to tip, especially if the bartender's action felt coercive or manipulative. The customer didn't refuse to pay for the drinks, just the tip. The bartender's refusal to serve might be his right as per club policy, but the customer's action of not tipping wasn't in the wrong. So, the answer would be B, No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
