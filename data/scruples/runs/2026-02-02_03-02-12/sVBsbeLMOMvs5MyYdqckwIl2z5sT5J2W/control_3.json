      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the person is asking if they're in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four of them to four drinks each. That seems like a lot, maybe 20 drinks? When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The person was drunk but not too drunk, noticed the tip being added, and then decided to tip 0%. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip. The person says they were willing to tip an appropriate amount but didn't want the bartender to take advantage of their drunkenness by adding the tip without asking.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. First, tipping practices can vary, but in many places, especially the US, it's customary to tip service staff. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without permission. Normally, the customer is in control of the tip amount, even if the receipt might have a suggested percentage. If the bartender unilaterally added 20%, that's not standard unless it's a forced gratuity, which is usually for large groups or events. The person might have felt that the bartender was being manipulative by adding the tip without consent, especially since they were drunk. \n\nBut then the person responded by not tipping at all. That seems extreme. Even if the bartender did something questionable, retaliating by leaving zero tip might not be the best approach. However, the bartender's reaction of refusing to serve them could be a problem too. Maybe the person had the right to tip as they saw fit, but leaving zero might be a harsh response to an unfair tip addition. \n\nBut in some cases, if the bartender added the tip without asking, the person might not be obligated to pay it. However, the person could have just removed the tip instead of adding zero. Also, the situation escalates when the bartender threatens not to serve them. The person might have been within their rights to not pay the forced tip but perhaps should have handled it differently. \n\nSo, is the person in the wrong? If the bartender added a tip without permission, the person isn't necessarily wrong for disputing it. But not tipping at all could be seen as punitive. However, the bartender's actions of adding the tip without consent might be the main issue here. The person might not be in the wrong because the bartender overstepped, but their response could be seen as harsh. So maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
