The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author said something was \"obvious\" during a discussion with his girlfriend about a psychology experiment. She felt hurt because using the word \"obviously\" made her feel dumb. He argues that it was obvious and that he didn't mean it in a snarky way, but she's upset and wants an apology. He refuses to apologize, thinking it's not a big deal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is a psych major. The author believed that as a psych major, she should have found the experiment's conclusion obvious. But she mentions that when she first learned about it, it wasn't obvious to her. So, maybe the author is making an assumption based on her current knowledge versus when she first encountered it.\n\nThe key here is the use of the word \"obviously.\" Even if the author didn't mean it sarcastically, the word itself can come off as dismissive. People often use \"obviously\" to belittle someone's lack of understanding, even if that's not the speaker's intent. The girlfriend felt hurt, which is a valid emotional response. The author is dismissing her feelings by saying it was safe to assume it was obvious to her. But her experience matters here\u2014she didn't find it obvious at the time, so his comment invalidated her perspective.\n\nHe also says he doesn't care that she was offended and that she should get over it. That's problematic because it shows a lack of empathy. Even if he didn't mean to be hurtful, acknowledging her feelings is important in a relationship. By not apologizing and insisting it's not a big deal, he's not taking her emotions seriously. Relationships require mutual respect and consideration, so being dismissive of her valid feelings could be seen as the author being in the wrong.\n\nAnother angle is communication style. Using \"obviously\" can be a habit, but in interactions where someone might feel their knowledge or experience is being questioned, it's better to avoid such language. The author's refusal to apologize and his stance that her feelings shouldn't have been hurt further exacerbates the issue. It's not just about the word used but the response to the hurt feelings.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even if the author didn't intend to be hurtful, his choice of words and subsequent dismissal of her feelings likely make him at fault here.\n"
