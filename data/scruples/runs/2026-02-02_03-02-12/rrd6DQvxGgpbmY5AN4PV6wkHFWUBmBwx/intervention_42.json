The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about using the word \"obviously\" during a conversation with his girlfriend, which she found offensive. The author is defending his use of the word, saying it was obvious and that as a psych major, she should have known it. But she felt it made her feel dumb.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the girlfriend. She's a psych major and learned about the experiment in class. She found it cool when she learned it, but later when the author called it \"obvious,\" she felt that he was belittling her. Even though the conclusion was common knowledge, the way he presented it might have come across as dismissive of her experience of learning it. Using \"obviously\" can imply that someone else should know it, which can be hurtful. \n\nThe author argues that it was just a statement of fact and that he didn't mean it snarkily. But in communication, the impact is more important than the intent. Even if he didn't mean to hurt her, the effect was there. The girlfriend is expressing her feelings, and the author is invalidating them by saying \"I don't care\" and insisting it's not a big deal. That's a red flag. \n\nThe author is also suggesting she shouldn't get offended over little things. That's not a healthy approach. Relationships require empathy and understanding each other's feelings. Dismissing someone's hurt feelings because you think the issue is trivial can lead to bigger problems. \n\nSo, even if the author didn't intend to be rude, using \"obviously\" in a way that makes his partner feel stupid is a mistake. He should have considered how his words might affect her and chosen a more empathetic response. The fact that he's not willing to apologize despite hurting her feelings shows a lack of consideration for her emotions, which is a problem in the relationship.\n"
