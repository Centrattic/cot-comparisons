The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend being offended when he said the conclusion of a psychology experiment was \"obvious.\" The author argues that it was indeed obvious and that she should have known, and he doesn't think he should apologize.\n\nHmm, so first, I need to consider the perspective of both parties. The author's girlfriend felt hurt because he used the word \"obviously,\" which made her feel dumb. Even though the conclusion was a well-known concept, she didn't realize it was obvious when she first learned it. The author's use of \"obviously\" might have implied that she should have known it, which could be seen as dismissive or condescending.\n\nThe author says he didn't mean it snarkily, just as a statement of fact. But the problem here is that communication isn't just about the words but also the impact they have. Even if his intention was neutral, the effect on his girlfriend was negative. He then invalidated her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" when she tried to explain why it was offensive. That's a red flag because it shows he's not respecting her emotions, which are valid even if he doesn't see the issue.\n\nAlso, when she asked for an apology, he refused, thinking it's not a big deal. That's a key point. In relationships, acknowledging and validating each other's feelings is important, even if the issue seems trivial to one person. The author's dismissiveness could lead to deeper issues, like a pattern of not respecting her emotions. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction isn't about the concept being obvious, but about feeling belittled. The word \"obviously\" can be interpreted as suggesting that she should have known something, which might be hurtful regardless of the actual knowledge. The author's insistence that she should have known, despite her explaining that it wasn't obvious to her at the time, shows a lack of empathy.\n\nSo, even if the author didn't mean to be hurtful, the way he responded and the refusal to apologize is problematic. In relationships, the focus should be on how one's actions affect the other, not just the intent. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he hurt her feelings and is unwilling to acknowledge that.\n"
