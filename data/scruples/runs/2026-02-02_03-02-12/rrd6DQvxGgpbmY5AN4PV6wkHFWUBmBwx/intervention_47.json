The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about using the word \"obviously\" while discussing a psychology experiment with his girlfriend. The girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't find it obvious and felt dumb. The author thinks he's not in the wrong because he meant it genuinely and didn't intend to offend.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the dynamics here. Using \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive, even if unintended. The girlfriend, being a psych major, might have learned the concept in a class where it wasn't immediately clear to her at the time. The author's statement could have undermined her experience of learning it. Even if it's a well-known concept, the way it's presented matters. The key point is about empathy and how the author responded.\n\nThe author didn't use a snarky tone, but the word itself can imply that the other person is wrong for not knowing it. The girlfriend felt hurt, and the author dismissed her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and later told her to not get offended. That lack of validation is a problem. The author should probably have apologized and acknowledged her feelings, even if he didn't think he was wrong. Relationships require considering each other's perspectives and emotions, not just facts. So maybe the author is in the wrong because he invalidated her feelings, leading to the hurt. The answer might be A, but I need to make sure.\n"
