The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a disagreement between the author and their girlfriend over using the word \"obviously.\" The author said an experiment's conclusion was obvious, and the girlfriend felt hurt because it made her feel dumb. The author doesn't think they were wrong and even says they don't care about her feelings in this case.\n\nFirst, even if the conclusion really is obvious, using \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive. The girlfriend mentioned she was excited when she learned about it and didn't see it as obvious at the time. The author's response might have undermined her experience. The key here is intent versus impact. The author didn't mean to be snarky, but the effect was still hurtful.\n\nThe author's refusal to apologize and their attitude that it's a small issue could be problematic. The girlfriend feels her feelings are valid, and the author dismissing her reaction as overreacting might be seen as invalidating her emotions. Relationships often require compromise and empathy. Even if the author doesn't think they were wrong, their response to the hurt feelings matters. Not apologizing and insisting the other person \"get over it\" can strain the relationship.\n\nSo, while the author might not have had bad intentions, their words had a negative impact, and their reaction to the hurt feelings is what's more concerning. The answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they failed to consider their partner's feelings and responded dismissively.\n"
