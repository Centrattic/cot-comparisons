The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" when discussing an experiment with their girlfriend. The user argues that the conclusion was indeed obvious and that their girlfriend, as a psych major, should have known it. The girlfriend felt hurt because the word made her feel dumb, even though she found the experiment cool when she first learned it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. Communication styles differ between people. The author might not have intended to be dismissive, but using \"obviously\" can come off as condescending, especially in a relationship where both parties want to feel respected and valued. Even if the conclusion was obvious, the way it's phrased matters. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt invalidated, which is a common emotional response when someone perceives another as belittling their experience.\n\nThe author's refusal to apologize and their dismissal of the girlfriend's feelings (\"I don't care\") might be problematic. They're not acknowledging her perspective, which could lead to further resentment. Even if the author believes they're right, relationships often require compromise and empathy. The fact that the girlfriend was trying to explain her feelings and the author invalidated them by saying \"I don't care\" shows a lack of emotional support.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not see the issue as significant, thinking the conclusion was obvious. But in relationships, it's not just about being right; it's about how actions affect the other person. The key here is whether the author's words caused hurt, which they did, and whether they're willing to recognize and address that. The author's stance that the girlfriend should \"get over it\" suggests a lack of willingness to address her feelings, which is a red flag.\n\nSo considering all these points, the author's actions, while perhaps unintentional, did hurt their partner's feelings. The refusal to apologize and dismissive attitude towards her emotions makes them more at fault. Therefore, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
