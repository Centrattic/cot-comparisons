The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author using the word \"obviously\" in a conversation with his girlfriend, which she found offensive.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the details. The author said something was \"obviously\" the case, thinking it was clear. The girlfriend felt that made her feel dumb because she didn't find it obvious when she learned about the experiment. The author argues that the conclusion was well-known and obvious, so he assumed she would have found it obvious too. He doesn't think he was wrong to say that and refuses to apologize, thinking the feelings should have been ignored.\n\nThe key points here are about communication and empathy. Using \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive, even if not intended. The girlfriend's perspective is that she felt her experience (not finding it obvious) was minimized. The author's stance is that the conclusion was indeed obvious, so the word wasn't meant to offend.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to consider how your words affect the other person, even if you don't mean to be hurtful. The fact that the girlfriend felt hurt and the author's refusal to acknowledge her feelings might indicate a lack of empathy. Even if the author didn't mean to be snarky, the word \"obviously\" can be triggering for some people. \n\nThe author's response to her explanation was dismissive (\"I don't care\") and he invalidated her feelings by saying she should get over it. That's a problem because it shows he's not respecting her emotional reaction. In healthy relationships, both parties should validate each other's feelings, even if they don't see eye to eye on the issue.\n\nSo, even if the conclusion was obvious, the way it was communicated mattered. The author is in the wrong here for not considering her feelings and for being dismissive after she explained her hurt. Answer A.\n"
