The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author using the word \"obviously\" when discussing a psychology experiment with his girlfriend, which made her feel hurt and dumb.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author thought the conclusion was obvious, given that she's a psych major. He didn't mean to be snarky but used the word \"obviously.\" His girlfriend felt that the word was offensive and made her feel stupid because she didn't realize it was obvious when she first learned about it. She's upset and wants an apology, but the author doesn't think he's wrong because he didn't intend to hurt her and thinks her reaction is overblown.\n\nFrom a communication perspective, using words like \"obviously\" can come across as dismissive. Even if the author didn't mean to, the girlfriend interpreted it as making her feel dumb. The key here is intent vs. impact. The author's intent was not to offend, but the impact on her feelings was negative. In relationships, how partners perceive things matters a lot. The author's response of saying he doesn't care that she was hurt and telling her to get over it seems dismissive of her feelings. That could make the situation worse because it's about not validating her emotions.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt hurt. People can have different sensitivities, and even if the author didn't mean to, his words had an effect. The author's response of not apologizing and dismissing her feelings could be seen as the problem here. In healthy relationships, it's important to acknowledge each other's feelings even if you don't see eye to eye. The author's refusal to apologize might be inconsiderate, even if his initial use of \"obviously\" wasn't malicious.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong not because the word \"obviously\" alone is inherently wrong, but because of the way he responded to her hurt feelings. Dismissing her feelings and not apologizing when she clearly felt hurt is likely the bigger issue here. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't validate her feelings and refused to apologize, which can harm the relationship.\n"
