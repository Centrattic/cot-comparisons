The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they were discussing a psychology experiment. The girlfriend mentioned an experiment, and the author said the conclusion was obvious. The girlfriend took offense because of the word \"obviously,\" feeling it made her feel dumb. The author thinks they're not wrong because the conclusion was indeed obvious and that as a psych major, she should have known.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core issue. The main point of contention is the use of the word \"obviously.\" The author argues it wasn't meant to be snarky, just stating a fact. The girlfriend felt hurt because the word \"obviously\" implied that the conclusion was too simple, suggesting she wasn't smart for not realizing it immediately. \n\nNow, communication is key here. Even if the author didn't mean to be condescending, the effect on the girlfriend was negative. The word \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive, regardless of intent. The author might not see it that way, but the girlfriend felt it was a personal attack on her intelligence. \n\nThe author also mentions not caring about her feelings, which is a red flag. Even if they claim to care, dismissing her reaction as \"just getting over it\" and saying she should not get offended by little things suggests a lack of empathy. It's important to validate someone's feelings, even if you don't see why they're upset. \n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend is a psych major. The author assumed she should know the conclusion, but maybe she was learning it for the first time in her class. The author's assumption that she should have found it obvious might be incorrect if she was introduced to it as a new concept. The author's use of \"obviously\" might have undermined her experience of learning something new.\n\nAlso, when the girlfriend tried to explain why the word was offensive, the author dismissed her explanation by saying \"I don't care.\" That's a problem because it shows a refusal to listen or understand her perspective. Validating feelings is crucial in relationships. Even if the author doesn't see the issue, not respecting her feelings can lead to more significant issues.\n\nThe author's stance that they don't owe an apology because they don't think it was a big deal might be the heart of the problem. In relationships, sometimes it's not about who's \"right\" but about showing respect and empathy. The girlfriend's feelings are valid even if the author doesn't see the issue. Dismissing someone's feelings, even unintentionally, can hurt the relationship.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's use of \"obviously\" hurt the girlfriend's feelings, and their response of not caring and dismissing her explanation likely made things worse. While the author might not have intended to be offensive, the impact was harmful. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not considering the effect of their words and for not validating the girlfriend's feelings.\n"
