The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author said something was obvious during a conversation with his girlfriend, who is a psych major. She felt hurt because he used the word \"obviously,\" making her feel dumb. The author thinks he's not wrong because the conclusion really was obvious and he didn't mean to be snarky.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. Communication is key in relationships, and sometimes even well-intentioned comments can hurt. The author used the word \"obviously,\" which is often seen as dismissive. Even if he didn't mean it that way, the effect on his girlfriend was negative. She felt her feelings were hurt, and she explained why. \n\nThe author's response to her concerns is also important. When she tried to explain why the word was offensive, he said \"I don't care\" and then later told her not to get offended by small things. That sounds dismissive of her feelings. Even if he apologizes, his refusal to acknowledge her perspective and his insistence that her feelings shouldn't have been hurt shows a lack of empathy. \n\nThe key here is the intention vs. impact. The author might not have intended to hurt her, but the impact was there. In relationships, it's important to validate each other's feelings, even if you don't see it the same way. By not apologizing and dismissing her feelings, he's not taking responsibility for his part in the hurt. \n\nAlso, the fact that she's a psych major doesn't mean she should know every concept's obviousness. People can find things interesting without them being obvious. The author's assumption that she should have found it obvious was incorrect, and his use of \"obviously\" undermined her experience of learning it. \n\nSo, even though the conclusion might be obvious to him, his use of the word was a misstep. The way he handled her reaction\u2014refusing to care about her feelings and not apologizing\u2014makes him at fault. The right approach would be to apologize and understand that her feelings are valid, even if he didn't mean harm. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
