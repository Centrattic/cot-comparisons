The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again. The person is asking if they're at fault for hurting their girlfriend's feelings by using the word \"obviously\" when discussing a psychology experiment she learned about.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend is a psych major and mentioned an experiment. The author thought the conclusion was obvious and said so, not in a snarky way. The girlfriend then felt hurt because she didn't find it obvious at first and the word made her feel dumb. The author argues that the conclusion is well-known and obvious, so it was safe to assume the girlfriend would know it. They also say they don't care that their word was offensive and don't think they need to apologize, even though they acknowledge hurting her feelings.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about communication and empathy. Using the word \"obviously\" can be seen as dismissive, even if not intended that way. The girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't find it obvious when she first learned it, so the word was invalidating her experience. The author is in denial about the impact of their words, even when the girlfriend explains her feelings. The author also says they don't care that others might be offended, and even told the girlfriend to not get worked up over little things. That sounds like they're dismissing her feelings instead of validating them.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Even if the author didn't mean to be offensive, the effect on the girlfriend was real. The author's response of not caring and refusing to apologize shows a lack of empathy. The girlfriend's feelings are valid because she felt invalidated. The author should have considered her perspective and maybe chosen their words more carefully. Instead, they invalidated her feelings again by saying she shouldn't get upset over small things. That's probably why the girlfriend is upset. So, I think the author is in the wrong here because they didn't consider how their words affected her and refused to acknowledge her feelings.\n"
