The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" when discussing an experiment with their girlfriend. The situation involves a disagreement over whether that word was offensive.\n\nFirst, the author's intention: They said the conclusion was obvious not in a snarky way but just stating their opinion. They believed it was a well-known concept, so they assumed their girlfriend, a psych major, would know it. However, the girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't realize it was obvious when she first learned about it. She felt the word \"obvious\" made her feel dumb.\n\nNow, considering communication styles. The author might not see the issue, thinking the term was neutral, but they didn't consider their girlfriend's perspective. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling invalidated. Even if the author didn't mean to be condescending, the impact on the girlfriend's feelings matters. Using \"obviously\" can often come off as dismissive in conversations, especially with someone who might be sensitive about their knowledge or feelings.\n\nThe author's response to the girlfriend's hurt feelings was to dismiss her perspective by saying \"I don't care\" about her feelings, which is a problem. Acknowledging someone's feelings is important in relationships. The author also told the girlfriend to \"not get offended about little things,\" which could be seen as invalidating her emotions again.\n\nEven if the author didn't intend harm, the key point here is about empathy and communication. In relationships, it's essential to consider how your words affect others, not just the literal meaning. The fact that the author didn't apologize and insisted their feelings shouldn't have been hurt suggests a lack of emotional understanding. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt disrespected. The author's refusal to apologize despite knowing they hurt her shows a disregard for her emotional needs.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions were inconsiderate, even if unintentional. Since the girlfriend clearly felt hurt and the author didn't properly address her feelings, the author is likely in the wrong. They should have used a different phrasing to avoid making her feel that way. Also, their dismissive reaction worsened the situation. Therefore, the correct answer is A.\n"
