The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author saying \"obviously\" during a discussion about a psychology experiment with his girlfriend. She felt hurt and offended because she didn't find it obvious at the time, and the use of \"obviously\" made her feel dumb. The author thinks she's overreacting and doesn't see why he should apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around using the word \"obviously.\" It's common knowledge that \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive or condescending, even if not intended that way. The key here is that the girlfriend was a psych major, but she didn't find it obvious when she first learned it. The author's assumption that she should have found it obvious might be the issue here.\n\nThe author's main argument is that the conclusion really is obvious, so using the word was justified. However, regardless of whether the conclusion was truly obvious, the way he expressed it caused hurt feelings. The problem isn't just the word itself but the effect it had on his partner. Communication in relationships often requires sensitivity, and even if someone didn't mean to be dismissive, if the effect is negative, it's important to acknowledge that.\n\nThe author also mentions not caring about her feelings when she explains why she was hurt. That's a red flag. Even if he didn't intend to hurt her, dismissing her feelings as an overreaction isn't healthy. The girlfriend felt the need to explain her perspective, but the author didn't validate her emotions, which can lead to deeper issues in the relationship.\n\nAdditionally, the author says he told his girlfriend to \"not get offended about such little things,\" which suggests he's not taking her feelings seriously. In a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's emotional responses and make efforts to communicate without causing harm.\n\nSo, even if the author didn't mean to be condescending, the act of using \"obviously\" in this context caused emotional harm, and his reaction to her feelings (not caring and dismissing her) exacerbates the problem. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for both his initial comment and his subsequent response to her hurt feelings.\n"
