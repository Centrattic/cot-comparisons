The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about using the word \"obviously\" in a conversation with his girlfriend, which hurt her feelings.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend is a psychology major. She's sharing something she learned in her class, and the author responds by saying the conclusion was \"obvious.\" The girlfriend feels that using \"obviously\" makes her feel dumb because she didn't find it obvious when she first learned it. \n\nThe author doesn't think he's wrong because he believes the conclusion is indeed obvious. He acknowledges that \"obviously\" can be offensive but thinks it wasn't the case here. He also mentions that he doesn't care about the feelings part and thinks she should get over it.\n\nNow, the key points here: The use of \"obviously\" is often seen as condescending because it implies the other person should have known something, which can be hurtful. Even if the author didn't mean it that way, the impact on the girlfriend was negative. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt hurt. The author's dismissal of her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and invalidating her perspective seems problematic. \n\nEven if the conclusion is objectively obvious, the way it's communicated matters. Relationships require empathy and considering the other person's feelings. The author's refusal to apologize and his insistence that it's not a big deal might be the real issue here. \n\nSo, while the author might not have intended to be offensive, the effect of his words and his subsequent response (not caring and dismissing her feelings) likely make him at fault. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, and the author should have considered her perspective better.\n"
