The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend feeling hurt when the author uses the word \"obviously\" during a conversation about a psychology experiment. The author thinks the conclusion was obvious and mentions it, but the girlfriend feels it makes her feel dumb.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the use of the word \"obviously.\" From what I know, using \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive or condescending because it implies that the listener should have known something, which can make them feel uninformed or criticized. Even if the author didn't mean it that way, the intention isn't the only factor here\u2014impact matters too.\n\nThe girlfriend is a psych major, and the author assumed she would find it obvious. However, just because something is well-known doesn't mean everyone perceives it as obvious at the time of learning. The girlfriend might have had an \"aha\" moment when she first learned the concept, so the author's comment could negate her personal experience of understanding it.\n\nThe author then dismisses her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and later tells her to not get offended over small things. This response is problematic because it invalidates her emotions. Even if the author didn't intend to hurt her, responding in a way that dismisses her feelings can escalate the situation. Relationships require empathy and the willingness to acknowledge each other's feelings, even if one party doesn't fully understand why the feelings are hurt.\n\nThe author's defense that he wouldn't be offended if she said similar to him is a form of the \"what about me?\" fallacy. People's reactions can differ based on context and sensitivity. It's not about whether the author would be offended but about how the girlfriend felt. The key here is communication and respect for each other's perspectives.\n\nAlso, the author's insistence that the girlfriend should just \"get over it\" shows a lack of emotional support. In healthy relationships, partners should validate each other's feelings rather than brushing them off. The author's refusal to apologize despite the girlfriend's hurt feelings suggests a lack of consideration for her emotional well-being.\n\nSo, putting this together, the author's use of \"obviously\" might have been careless, and his subsequent dismissal of her feelings makes him the one in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
