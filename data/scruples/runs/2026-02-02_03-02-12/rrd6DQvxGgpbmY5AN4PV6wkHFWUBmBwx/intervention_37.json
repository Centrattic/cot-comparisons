The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" and not apologizing. The situation is that the author and their girlfriend discussed a psychology experiment. The author found the conclusion obvious and said so, which upset her. She felt it made her feel dumb because she didn't realize it was obvious when she learned it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the impact of the word \"obviously.\" Even if the author didn't mean to be condescending, the word can come across as dismissive. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because her feelings were hurt. The author's response of \"I don't care\" about her feelings is problematic. Even if the author believes they're right, dismissing someone's emotions is generally not acceptable in a relationship.\n\nThe author argues that it's safe to assume it was obvious to her as a psych major, but the fact that she didn't see it at first means the author's assumption was incorrect. Relationships require empathy and understanding. Not apologizing when someone is hurt, even if unintentionally, can damage trust and communication. The author's stance of minimizing her feelings by saying it's a \"big thing\" shows a lack of emotional support, which is crucial in a relationship. So, the author is in the wrong for not acknowledging her feelings and refusing to apologize.\n"
