The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" in a discussion with their girlfriend. The girlfriend felt hurt and offended, even though the author didn't mean it snarkily. The author thinks it's obvious that the conclusion is obvious, given the girlfriend is a psych major.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend mentioned she found the experiment's conclusion cool when she first learned it, and it wasn't obvious to her at the time. The author's use of \"obviously\" might have undermined her experience. Even if the author didn't intend to be dismissive, the impact on her feelings is real.\n\nThe key here is about empathy and communication. The author assumed that because the girlfriend is a psych major, she should have found it obvious. However, the girlfriend's reaction shows that she felt belittled. The author's response of not caring and invalidating her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and wanting her to get over it is problematic. It's not just the word \"obviously\" but the dismissive attitude towards her feelings. The author is not acknowledging her perspective, which is a mistake in a relationship. Even if the author meant to be neutral, the way they handled the situation\u2014refusing to apologize and not taking her feelings seriously\u2014puts them in the wrong. So, the answer is A.\n"
