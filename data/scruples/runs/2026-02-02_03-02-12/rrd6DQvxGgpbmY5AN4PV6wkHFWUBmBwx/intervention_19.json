The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about using the word \"obviously\" when discussing a psychology experiment with their girlfriend. The girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't find it obvious at first, and the author thinks the girlfriend is overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the situation. The author used the word \"obviously,\" which can often come off as dismissive. Even if they didn't mean it snarkily, the word itself can imply that the other person's lack of understanding is foolish. The girlfriend is a psych major, so the author might think she should know it, but the experiment's conclusion might not be obvious to everyone, even within the field. \n\nThe key here is about perspective. The author assumed the conclusion was obvious, but the girlfriend didn't feel that way when she learned it. By using \"obviously,\" the author might have unintentionally made her feel like her experience of finding it non-obvious was invalidated. Even if the conclusion is a well-known concept, the reaction to not knowing it can vary. The girlfriend felt stupid, which is a valid emotional response. \n\nOn the other hand, the author argues that they didn't mean it offensively and that the girlfriend is overreacting. They also mention not caring about her feelings, which could be a problem in communication. However, the author does acknowledge hurting her feelings but still doesn't think it's a big deal. \n\nIn relationships, communication and empathy are crucial. The author's refusal to apologize and their dismissal of her feelings might be more harmful than the initial use of \"obviously.\" The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling respected and validated. Even if the author didn't intend harm, the impact on the girlfriend matters. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they failed to consider how their words affected their partner and refused to acknowledge her feelings. Even if the word wasn't used with malice, the effect was hurtful, and a good relationship requires apologizing for that. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
