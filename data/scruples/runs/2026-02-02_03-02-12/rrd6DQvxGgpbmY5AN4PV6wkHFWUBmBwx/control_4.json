The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author used the word \"obviously\" when talking to their girlfriend about a psychology experiment. The girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't find the conclusion obvious at the time she learned it, and she felt the author was making her feel dumb.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the use of the word \"obviously.\" It's a common word people use, but it can come off as dismissive. Even if the author didn't mean to be snarky, the word itself might carry that connotation. The girlfriend is a psych major, so maybe she's more sensitive to such language, or maybe she just had a negative experience with that word before.\n\nThe author argues that the conclusion really is obvious and that as a psych major, his girlfriend should have known that. But the key point here is that the girlfriend didn't find it obvious when she first learned about it. The author's use of \"obviously\" might be invalidating her experience. Even if the conclusion is common knowledge now, it wasn't obvious to her at the time. The author's comment could be seen as minimizing her learning process.\n\nThen, when the girlfriend expressed her feelings, the author didn't apologize and instead dismissed her by saying \"I don't care,\" leading her to feel that he wasn't respecting her feelings. The author then tells her she should get over it and not be offended by small things. That's a problem because invalidating someone's feelings, even if you don't see the issue, is typically seen as hurtful. It's important to acknowledge how someone feels, even if you don't agree with their interpretation.\n\nSo, even if the author didn't intend to be offensive, the impact on the girlfriend was real. The fact that she felt hurt and the author's dismissive response likely make him at fault here. The author's refusal to apologize and his belief that her reaction is overblown show a lack of empathy. In relationships, it's important to consider the other person's perspective and validate their feelings, even if you don't fully understand the reason. The right approach would have been to apologize and reassure her that he didn't mean to make her feel that way.\n"
