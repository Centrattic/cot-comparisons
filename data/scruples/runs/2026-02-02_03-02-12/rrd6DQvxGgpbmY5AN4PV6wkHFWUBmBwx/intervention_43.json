The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement between a couple about using the word \"obviously.\" The girlfriend felt hurt when the author said something was obvious, implying that she should have known it. The author thinks it was obvious and doesn't see the problem, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend is a psychology major, so maybe she's more aware of the nuances of communication. The word \"obviously\" can be seen as dismissive because it might make the listener feel their perspective is undervalued. Even if the author didn't mean it that way, the effect on the girlfriend was negative. \n\nThe author mentions that the conclusion was a well-known concept, so maybe he believes the girlfriend should have known it. But even if that's true, the way he communicated it could have been more considerate. The key point here is about empathy and emotional intelligence. Even if the statement wasn't intentional, the impact still caused hurt feelings. \n\nWhen the girlfriend explained her feelings, the author responded dismissively by saying \"I don't care\" and later told her not to get offended over small things. That's not helpful. The author should acknowledge her feelings instead of invalidating them. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's perspectives, even if they differ. The author's refusal to apologize and insistence that it's not a big deal might be seen as not taking her feelings seriously. The fact that she felt stupid is significant. Even if the author didn't intend to belittle her, the result is that her feelings were hurt. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that the content was indeed obvious, and the girlfriend overreacted. But from a communication standpoint, using \"obviously\" can come off as condescending. The author's response to her concerns\u2014saying \"I don't care\" about her feelings\u2014definitely adds to the problem. \n\nSo, even if the author didn't mean harm, the way he handled the situation, especially after being told it hurt her feelings, shows a lack of consideration. The main issue here is the author's dismissiveness towards her emotional response. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he didn't consider her feelings adequately and failed to respond with empathy.\n"
