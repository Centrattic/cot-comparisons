The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" in a conversation with his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the context: the girlfriend is a psychology major, and they were discussing an experiment. The author found the conclusion obvious and stated it as such. The girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't find it obvious when she first learned about it, and the use of \"obviously\" made her feel dumb.\n\nThe key points here are communication styles and emotional impact. The author didn't intend to be snarky, but the word \"obviously\" often comes off as dismissive. Even if the conclusion was indeed obvious to him, the way he conveyed it might have been insensitive. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt her feelings were invalidated when she explained her perspective. The author then dismissed her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and insisted it wasn't a big deal, which escalated the conflict. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to validate each other's emotions. Even if the author didn't mean harm, the effect was hurtful. The girlfriend's sensitivity to the word \"obviously\" is something the author should acknowledge. The fact that she was a psych major and found the experiment cool initially adds to her perspective that her experience was different. \n\nThe author's stance that she should \"get over it\" shows a lack of empathy. Instead of defending his actions, he should have apologized to show that he cares about her feelings. The responsibility here is on the author to recognize that his words had a negative impact, regardless of intent. So, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
