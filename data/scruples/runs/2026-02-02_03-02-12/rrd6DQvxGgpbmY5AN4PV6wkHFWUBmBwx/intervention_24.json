The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about using the word \"obviously\" during a conversation with their girlfriend about a psychology experiment. The girlfriend felt offended and hurt because she didn't find the conclusion obvious at the time she learned it. The author is defending their use of the word, saying they didn't mean to be snarky and that they assumed it was obvious as she's a psych major. They're also refusing to apologize, thinking it's not a big deal.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the impact of the word \"obviously\" in communication. I've heard that using such words can come off as dismissive or condescending, even if not intended that way. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt her feelings were hurt. The author is dismissing her feelings by saying they don't care about her feelings, which is a problem. Even if they meant it as a neutral statement, the effect on the other person matters. \n\nThe key here is whether the author should have considered how their words might be perceived. The girlfriend had a different experience; she didn't find it obvious when she first learned it. By using \"obviously,\" the author might have unintentionally undermined her experience of learning the experiment. The author's response, refusing to apologize and telling the girlfriend to not get offended over little things, seems dismissive. \n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. Even if the author didn't mean to be offensive, the act of not acknowledging the hurt feelings and dismissing her perspective is problematic. Apologizing isn't just about being wrong but showing empathy. The author is in a position where they need to validate their partner's feelings, even if they don't see the issue the same way. \n\nAlso, the author is arguing that since they don't see the issue, others wouldn't either, but that's not the case. People have different sensitivities. The girlfriend's reaction is a legitimate emotional response. The author's refusal to apologize and their stance that she should just get over it suggests a lack of empathy, which is a red flag in a relationship. \n\nSo putting it all together, even if the author didn't intend to be hurtful, their failure to recognize the impact on their partner and their dismissive response likely means they are in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
