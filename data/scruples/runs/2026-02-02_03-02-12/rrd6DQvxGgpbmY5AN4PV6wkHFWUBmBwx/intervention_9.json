The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" in a conversation with their girlfriend. The girlfriend, a psychology major, mentioned an experiment or concept from her class, and the author responded that the conclusion was obvious. The girlfriend felt this made her feel dumb because she didn't find it obvious at the time, even though she's a psych major.\n\nFirst, the key point here is the use of the word \"obviously.\" The author argues that the conclusion really is obvious and that it's safe to assume a psych major would know that. However, the girlfriend's perspective is that she found it challenging or not obvious when she first learned it, so being called out as \"obvious\" made her feel diminished. \n\nCommunication in relationships often hinges on empathy and understanding. Even if the author believes the conclusion was obvious, the way they phrased it could come across as dismissive. The word \"obviously\" can carry a tone of condescension, implying that the other person should have known something, which can be hurtful. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt her experience (not finding it obvious) was invalidated. \n\nThe author's response to the girlfriend's feelings is also a point of contention. When the girlfriend explains why the word was offensive, the author dismisses this by saying \"I don't care\" and later insists that the girlfriend shouldn't get offended by small things. This shows a lack of willingness to acknowledge her feelings, which is a red flag in a healthy relationship. Even if the author didn't intend to be hurtful, the response exacerbates the situation by invalidating her emotions. \n\nMoreover, being a psych major doesn't necessarily mean someone finds every concept obvious. People have different learning experiences and paces. The author's assumption that a psych major should know or find it obvious might be an overgeneralization. The fact that the girlfriend was proud of learning it and felt hurt when the author dismissed it suggests that the author's comment undermined her feelings of accomplishment.\n\nThe author's refusal to apologize and their stance that the girlfriend should \"get over it\" further indicate a lack of emotional support. Healthy relationships require both partners to validate each other's feelings, even if they don't fully understand or agree with them. The author's actions here show a failure to do that, which is problematic.\n\nIn summary, while the author didn't intend to be hurtful, the use of \"obviously\" likely came off as condescending, and their subsequent dismissal of the girlfriend's feelings made the situation worse. The girlfriend's emotional response is valid, and the author's refusal to apologize indicates a lack of empathy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
