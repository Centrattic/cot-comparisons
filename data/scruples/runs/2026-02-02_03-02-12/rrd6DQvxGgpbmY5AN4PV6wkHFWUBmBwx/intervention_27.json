The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about using the word \"obviously\" in a discussion with his psychology-major girlfriend. He thought the conclusion of an experiment was obvious and said so, but she felt he was being dismissive and made her feel dumb. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is a psych major, so maybe she's more sensitive to how communication affects emotions. The author didn't say it in a snarky way, but the word \"obviously\" can come off as condescending. Even if he didn't mean it that way, the effect on her was negative. She felt hurt because she didn't find it obvious at first, and now his comment made her feel like she should have. \n\nThe author argues that it was a safe assumption that she would know it's obvious since she's a psych major. However, just because someone is in a field doesn't mean they know all the nuances. Maybe she was still learning and the experiment was new to her. Also, the word \"obviously\" can invalidate someone's experience of learning something new. \n\nHe also mentioned not caring when she explained why she was offended. Even if he doesn't agree with her feelings, dismissing her explanation as not important could be seen as not respecting her emotions. The fact that he called her overreacting might make her feel like her feelings aren't valid. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Even if the intention wasn't to hurt, the outcome matters. The author did hurt her feelings, and the appropriate response would be to apologize and try to understand her perspective. By saying he doesn't think he's wrong and that she should just get over it, he's not taking responsibility. \n\nSo, even though he didn't mean to be rude, the impact of his words was hurtful. In such cases, the responsibility often lies with the person whose words caused the hurt. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
