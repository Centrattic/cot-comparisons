The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for hurting their girlfriend's feelings by using the word \"obviously.\"\n\nFirst, the situation: the author was talking to their girlfriend about a psychology experiment. The conclusion was obvious to them, so they said it was \"obviously\" the case. The girlfriend felt offended because using \"obviously\" made her feel dumb. She's a psych major, and she didn't find it obvious when she first learned it. The author thinks the girlfriend overreacted and doesn't think an apology is needed.\n\nHmm. So, the main issue here is the use of the word \"obviously.\" The author argues that since the conclusion was obvious, it was safe to assume the girlfriend should know that. But the girlfriend felt her feelings were hurt because she didn't realize it was obvious at the time. \n\nI remember that in communication, using words like \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive or condescending, even if not intended. It's a common point in discussions about being mindful in conversations. The author might not have meant to be rude, but the effect was still hurtful. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is about feeling invalidated. She learned the experiment in her class, but at the time, it wasn't obvious to her. When the author says it's obvious, it might make her feel like she should have known it, leading to feeling unintelligent. The author's response to her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and insisting she should get over it seems dismissive of her emotions. That could be problematic because it's about invalidating her feelings. \n\nThe author's stance is that the girlfriend is overreacting and that the situation wasn't a big deal. However, in relationships, it's important to acknowledge how one's words affect the other. Even if the author didn't have ill intent, the impact is still real. The girlfriend's sensitivity here is valid because she felt hurt. The author's response of not apologizing and telling her to not get offended over small things could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, even if the author didn't mean to be offensive, the act of using \"obviously\" led to hurt feelings. The author's refusal to apologize and their dismissal of her feelings might make them wrong in this situation. The key here is about empathy and recognizing that sometimes words have unintended consequences, even if the speaker didn't intend harm. The right approach would be to apologize and reassure her, not dismiss her feelings.\n"
