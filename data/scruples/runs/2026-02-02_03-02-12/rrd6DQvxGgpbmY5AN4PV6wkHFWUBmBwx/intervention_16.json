The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" which hurt his girlfriend's feelings. The situation involves a discussion about a psychology experiment. The author thought the conclusion was obvious, so he used the word, but the girlfriend felt it made her feel dumb.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author's reasoning is that the conclusion is well-known and obvious, so he assumed his girlfriend, a psych major, would have found it obvious too. He didn't mean it snarkily. However, the girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't have that knowledge at first and the word \"obviously\" made her feel like her experience of learning it wasn't valid.\n\nNow, considering communication in relationships, even if the author didn't intend to be dismissive, using \"obviously\" can come off as belittling. People often have different experiences and knowledge bases. Just because something is common knowledge to one person doesn't mean it's obvious to another, especially if they're learning it for the first time. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt her feelings were invalidated when the author dismissed her perspective.\n\nThe author's response was to say \"I don't care\" and then told her not to get offended over little things. That's problematic because acknowledging someone's feelings is important in maintaining respect and empathy. Even if the author believes he's right, not validating her feelings can lead to resentment. The key here is that the author didn't take responsibility and instead tried to justify his actions, which might make him at fault.\n\nSo, considering that the girlfriend's feelings were hurt and the author didn't validate them, it seems like the author is in the wrong. Even if he didn't mean it offensively, the impact matters. The correct choice would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
