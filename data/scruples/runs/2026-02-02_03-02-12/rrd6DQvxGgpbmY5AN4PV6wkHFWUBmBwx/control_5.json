The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about using the word \"obviously\" during a conversation with their girlfriend, which led to her feeling hurt and offended.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The girlfriend is a psych major and mentioned an experiment. The author said the conclusion was obvious. The girlfriend felt that using \"obvious\" made her feel dumb because she didn't think it was obvious when she first learned it. The author doesn't see the issue, thinking it's a well-known concept, and even went as far as saying \"I don't care\" when she explained her feelings. Now he's being asked to apologize but doesn't think he should have to.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the use of \"obviously,\" the girlfriend's emotional response, and the author's reaction to her feelings. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI know that in communication, the word \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive or condescending, even if not intended. It can imply that the other person should have known something, which can be hurtful. The author might have thought it was a neutral observation, but the girlfriend felt belittled. The key here is intent vs. impact. Even if the author didn't mean to hurt her, the impact was hurtful. \n\nThen, when the girlfriend expressed her feelings, the author dismissed them by saying \"I don't care.\" That's a problem. Validating someone's feelings is important, even if you don't agree with their perspective. By invalidating her feelings, he's not showing empathy, which can make the situation worse. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling respected and understood, not just the word itself. \n\nThe author also claims that she shouldn't get offended over little things. That's a bit of a defense that minimizes her feelings. In a relationship, it's important to respect each other's emotional experiences, even if they differ. His stance of not apologizing despite her hurt feelings shows a lack of consideration for her perspective. \n\nSo, putting this together: the author used a word that unintentionally hurt his girlfriend, then dismissed her feelings instead of addressing them. This behavior is dismissive and not considerate of her emotional state. Even if the concept was obvious to him, assuming she should have found it obvious isn't fair. She might have had a different experience when she first learned it. \n\nThe answer would be that the author is in the wrong because he hurt her feelings and didn't validate her response. The correct choice is A.\n"
