The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author using the word \"obviously\" when commenting on a psychology experiment conclusion. The girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't realize the conclusion was obvious, and the author didn't think it was a big deal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's point is that the conclusion was indeed obvious, especially since the girlfriend is a psychology major. They meant it straightforwardly without any snark. On the other hand, the girlfriend felt that the use of \"obviously\" was condescending, making her feel dumb. She's a psych major, but maybe she found the experiment interesting because it wasn't obvious to her at first, or she was proud of learning it.\n\nThe key here is understanding intent vs. impact. The author's intention wasn't malicious, but the word \"obviously\" can be perceived as dismissive regardless of intent. Even if the conclusion is common knowledge, using such language can undermine someone's feelings. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt disrespected, and the author's response of \"I don't care\" when she expressed her feelings shows a lack of empathy.\n\nThe author argues that the girl should get over it, which might indicate a communication issue. In relationships, validating each other's feelings is important. Even if the author thinks the issue is minor, the fact that the girlfriend felt hurt matters. Refusing to apologize and dismissing her feelings as overreacting isn't helpful. Healthy relationships require both parties to acknowledge each other's emotions, even if they don't see the problem the same way.\n\nSo, while the author might not have intended to hurt, the impact was real, and the response was dismissive. The author is in the wrong for not apologizing and invalidating the girlfriend's feelings. The answer should be A.\n"
