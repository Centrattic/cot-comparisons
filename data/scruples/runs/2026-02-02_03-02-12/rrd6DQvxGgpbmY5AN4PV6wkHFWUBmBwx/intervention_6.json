The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about using the word \"obviously\" when discussing a psychology experiment with their girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author claims they didn't mean to be snarky and just stated the conclusion was obvious. However, the girlfriend felt hurt and made to feel dumb. The key here is understanding the impact of the word \"obviously.\" Even if the author didn't intend to be condescending, using that term can often come across as dismissive. \n\nThe author is a psych major and assumed the conclusion was obvious to his girlfriend. But the girlfriend was learning about it in her class and didn't find it obvious at the time. The author's use of \"obviously\" might have undermined her experience of learning something new. \n\nThe author also mentions not caring when his girlfriend explains why the word was offensive, which could be seen as invalidating her feelings. Even if he apologizes, his refusal to acknowledge her perspective might be problematic. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected, which is a significant emotional issue in a relationship.\n\nWhile the author might not have ill intentions, the way he handled the situation\u2014dismissing her feelings and not being willing to apologize\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate. Relationships require empathy and respect for each other's feelings, even if the person doesn't fully agree. \n\nSo, even if the author didn't mean to hurt her, the effect was there. The fact that he minimizes her feelings and expects her to \"get over it\" suggests a lack of emotional support. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
