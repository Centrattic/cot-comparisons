The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" when talking to his girlfriend about a psychology experiment conclusion.\n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend shared an experiment she learned in class, and the author thought the conclusion was obvious. He said it was obvious, not in a snarky way, but just stating his opinion. She felt offended because \"obviously\" made her feel dumb. She was a psych major and thought it was cool when she learned it, so the author assuming it was obvious hurt her feelings.\n\nThe author's defense is that the conclusion really is obvious, and as a psych major, she should have known that. He doesn't think he was wrong because he didn't mean to be snarky. He even said he's sorry for hurting her feelings but doesn't think he should have to apologize. The girlfriend is upset because he invalidated her feelings by not agreeing with her that \"obviously\" was offensive.\n\nSo, the key points here are about communication and empathy. The author might not realize how the word \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive, even if not intended that way. The girlfriend's perspective is that she felt belittled, which is a valid emotional response. The author's response of \"I don't care\" about her feelings (even if he cares) further escalates the conflict because he's not acknowledging her valid feelings.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to validate each other's emotions, even if you don't see them the same way. The author's insistence that her feelings shouldn't have been hurt and his dismissive attitude likely made the situation worse. The fact that he told her to \"not get offended about such little things\" suggests he's not taking her feelings seriously, which is a red flag.\n\nSo, even if the author didn't mean to be hurtful, the impact of his words was negative. The wrong here isn't just about the word choice but also the lack of empathy and validation after she expressed her hurt. The author's refusal to apologize further shows a lack of consideration for her feelings, which is definitely part of the problem.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong. He should have been more mindful of his words, acknowledged her feelings, and apologized instead of dismissing them. The answer should be A.\n"
