The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is a guy who was talking to his girlfriend about a psychology experiment. She told him about it, and he responded by saying the conclusion was obvious. She took offense because he used the word \"obviously,\" which made her feel dumb. She said she didn't find it obvious at the time she learned it, and his comment hurt her feelings. He argues that the conclusion is indeed well-known and obvious, so he didn't mean to offend her. He doesn't think he should have to apologize because he didn't intend to hurt her and thinks she's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I should consider the use of the word \"obviously.\" I know that in communication, the word \"obvious\" can come across as dismissive or condescending, even if that's not the intention. It might imply that the other person didn't understand something that the speaker considers simple, which can make people feel inadequate or not valued. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt hurt, even if the speaker didn't mean to be hurtful.\n\nThe speaker's argument is that the conclusion is well-known and obvious, so he assumed she would know it. However, everyone's experience with learning concepts can vary. Just because something is common knowledge in psychology doesn't mean that the person found it obvious when they first encountered it. She might have struggled with it or had a different perspective. The key here is that his comment, regardless of intent, caused her emotional distress.\n\nHe also mentions that he told her he was sorry for hurting her feelings but doesn't think he's wrong. His response to her feelings was dismissive when he said, \"I don't care,\" and later told her not to get offended over small things. That's problematic because it invalidates her feelings. Even if he didn't mean to, his response showed a lack of empathy.\n\nThe girlfriend's feelings are important in the relationship. If one partner's feelings are consistently dismissed, it can lead to resentment and hurt. The fact that she wanted an apology and he refuses to apologize shows a lack of willingness to acknowledge her perspective. Healthy relationships require both partners to validate each other's emotions, even if they don't fully agree.\n\nSo, even if the conclusion was obvious to him, the way he communicated it and his subsequent dismissal of her feelings make him at fault. The author is in the wrong because he didn't consider how his words might be perceived and failed to take her feelings seriously after she expressed being hurt. The answer should be A.\n"
