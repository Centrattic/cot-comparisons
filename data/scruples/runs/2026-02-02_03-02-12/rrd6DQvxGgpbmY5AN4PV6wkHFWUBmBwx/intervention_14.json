The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author used the word \"obviously\" when discussing an experiment with his girlfriend, which she found offensive because it made her feel dumb. He argues that the conclusion was obvious and that she, as a psych major, should have known it was obvious. She's hurt and wants an apology, but he doesn't think he's wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. Communication is key in any relationship, and sometimes even well-intentioned words can come off the wrong way. The author says he didn't mean it snarkily, but the use of \"obviously\" can often imply that the other person is not as knowledgeable or smart. Even if the author didn't intend to be dismissive, the effect on his girlfriend was negative. She felt hurt and stupid, which is a valid emotional response.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that since the conclusion is well-known and obvious, his girlfriend should have known. But that's assuming that because it's obvious to him, it was obvious to her. Everyone processes information differently. Just because something is common knowledge in psychology doesn't mean she didn't find it enlightening when she first learned it. Her reaction is about her personal experience, not the factual accuracy of the experiment.\n\nHe also mentions that he doesn't think her feelings should have been hurt, and when she's upset, he tells her to get over it. That's a problem. Dismissing someone's feelings as being over-sensitive can be harmful. Even if he didn't mean to, by not acknowledging her feelings and instead saying she shouldn't be hurt, he's invalidating her experience. That's a red flag in relationships. The fact that he says \"I don't care\" when she explains why the word was offensive shows a lack of empathy. He should listen and understand her perspective, not dismiss it.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The key points here are the use of \"obviously\" and the subsequent reaction. The word itself can be condescending, regardless of intent. Even if the author didn't mean to be rude, the impact on his girlfriend was negative. The fact that she felt hurt and that he's not willing to apologize or validate her feelings suggests that he's not taking her emotions seriously. In relationships, it's important to prioritize the other person's feelings, even if you don't see the issue. By not apologizing and telling her to move past it, he's not fostering a healthy communication environment.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong because he dismissed his girlfriend's feelings and didn't acknowledge the hurt he caused, even if unintentionally. The right approach would be to apologize and make an effort to communicate more sensitively in the future.\n"
