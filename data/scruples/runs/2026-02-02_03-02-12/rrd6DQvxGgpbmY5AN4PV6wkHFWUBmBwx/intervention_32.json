The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a disagreement between the author and their girlfriend over using the word \"obviously\" when discussing a psychology experiment.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author said the experiment's conclusion was obvious, not in a snarky way. The girlfriend felt offended because the use of \"obviously\" made her feel dumb. She mentioned she found it cool when she learned it and didn't know it was obvious. The author thinks it was obvious because it's a well-known concept and she's a psych major, so he assumed she'd know it.\n\nThe author doesn't think he was wrong and refuses to apologize, arguing that he's not invalidating her feelings but not seeing why the feelings were hurt. The girlfriend feels invalidated when he dismisses her reaction, leading to tension.\n\nNow, considering social dynamics and communication. The word \"obviously\" is commonly used in a way that can come off as condescending, even if not intended. The key here is intent vs. impact. Even if the author didn't mean to be dismissive, the impact on the girlfriend was hurtful. In relationships, partners often value each other's feelings and the effort to avoid causing pain, even if the offense seems minor to one person.\n\nThe author's stance is that the girlfriend shouldn't get worked up over small things. However, from her perspective, the comment was a personal slight. The fact that she's a psych major might lead her to be more sensitive about her understanding of concepts. The author's refusal to apologize and his insistence that he's right might be seen as dismissive of her emotional experience, which can be a problem in a relationship.\n\nIn many advice contexts, the idea is that even if something isn't intended to hurt, if it does, it's important to acknowledge the other person's feelings. The author's response of \"I don't care\" when she explains her hurt feelings is a red flag. It shows a lack of empathy and could indicate a pattern of not valuing her emotions.\n\nSo, while the author might not have had malicious intent, the way he responded after the fact exacerbates the issue. Relationships require mutual respect and effort to understand each other's perspectives. Dismissing someone's feelings, even if they seem trivial to you, can erode trust and respect. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he didn't validate his girlfriend's feelings and his response was dismissive, leading to further hurt.\n"
