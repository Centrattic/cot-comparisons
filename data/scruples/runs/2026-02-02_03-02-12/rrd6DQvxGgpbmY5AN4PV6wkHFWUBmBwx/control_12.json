The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author's girlfriend is a psychology major and they were discussing an experiment. The author said the conclusion was obvious, using the word \"obviously.\" The girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't find it obvious at the time she learned it, and the use of \"obviously\" made her feel dumb. The author, on the other hand, thinks the conclusion is well-known and that as a psych major, she should have found it obvious. He apologized but doesn't think he should have to, and he's telling her not to get offended over little things.\n\nFirst, communication in relationships often hinges on how things are said, not just the content. The word \"obviously\" can come across as dismissive. Even if the author didn't intend to be snarky, the girlfriend felt it was offensive. The key here is that the feelings were hurt regardless of intent. In relationships, it's important to consider the other person's perspective and emotions. \n\nThe author is defending his use of the word by saying it was \"safe to assume it was obvious to her too.\" However, the girlfriend's experience was different. She didn't find it obvious when she first learned it. The author's assumption that she should have known it was obvious might be a case of the \"curse of knowledge\"\u2014assuming others know what they know. \n\nThe author then dismisses her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" when she explains why the word was offensive. Even though he later apologizes, he invalidates her feelings, which can be more harmful. When someone is hurt, acknowledging their feelings is important, even if you don't agree with their reaction. By not apologizing and telling her to stop getting offended, he's not taking her feelings seriously. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main points are: using a potentially dismissive word, not considering her perspective, and invalidating her feelings. Even if the author didn't mean to be hurtful, the impact is what matters here. In relationships, it's about how your actions affect the other person. The author's response of not caring about her feelings, even if he does care, might be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he used a word that made his girlfriend feel dumb and then didn't respect her feelings when she explained why it was hurtful. Even if he didn't intend to harm, the effect was there, and proper resolution would involve a sincere apology and understanding her perspective.\n"
