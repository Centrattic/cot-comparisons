The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their girlfriend feel hurt by using the word \"obviously\" in a conversation about a psychology experiment.\n\nFirst, the author says they used \"obviously\" not in a snarky way but just to state the conclusion was clear. The girlfriend felt it made her feel dumb because she didn't realize it was obvious when she first learned it. The author thinks it was safe to assume she would know it was obvious since she's a psych major.\n\nNow, the key points here: the girlfriend's reaction is about feeling belittled. Even if the conclusion seems obvious to the author, the way they expressed it might have come off as dismissive. The word \"obviously\" can often be a trigger for people because it can imply that the other person should have known it without explanation. The author might not have intended to hurt her, but the effect was there.\n\nThe author also mentions that they didn't apologize and told the girlfriend to not get offended over small things. This seems dismissive of her feelings. Even if the author didn't mean to, acknowledging the hurt and apologizing is important in a relationship. Invalidating her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and expecting her to just move on isn't helpful. Relationships require empathy and understanding, even when the other person's perspective seems trivial.\n\nSo, while the author might not have intended to be hurtful, their response to the girlfriend's feelings (refusing to apologize and dismissing her reaction) is problematic. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
