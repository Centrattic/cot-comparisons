The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a disagreement between the author and his girlfriend over using the word \"obviously\" during a conversation about a psychological experiment.\n\nFirst, the author said that the experiment's conclusion was obvious. The girlfriend felt hurt because the word \"obviously\" made her feel dumb. The author argues that the conclusion really is obvious, especially since she's a psych major, and he doesn't think her feelings should be hurt. He even says he doesn't care that she's upset and thinks she should just get over it.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about communication and sensitivity. Using \"obviously\" can be dismissive, even if not intended that way. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt the word was offensive. The author, on the other hand, is dismissing her feelings by saying he doesn't care and that it's not a big deal. \n\nEven if the conclusion was obvious, the way it's communicated matters. The girlfriend's experience of learning it and finding it cool before realizing it was obvious to others is important. The author's assumption that she should have known it was obvious might be overlooking her personal experience. \n\nIn relationships, validating each other's feelings is crucial. By saying he doesn't care about her feelings and that she should get over it, the author is not showing the empathy needed. He's prioritizing his perspective over hers, which can damage trust and emotional connection. \n\nSo, even if the author didn't mean to be offensive, the impact of his words and his response to her hurt feelings make him at fault. He should have apologized and acknowledged her feelings instead of dismissing them. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
