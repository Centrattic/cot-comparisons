The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. Let me break down the scenario to understand both sides.\n\nThe author is in a relationship with his girlfriend, who's a psychology major. They were discussing an experiment she learned about. The author mentioned that the conclusion was obvious. The girlfriend took offense because she felt that using the word \"obviously\" made her feel dumb. She explained that when she first learned about it, it wasn't obvious to her, so his comment hurt her feelings. The author thinks he's not wrong because the conclusion really is obvious and he didn't mean to be snarky. He also feels that her reaction is overblown and that she should move on from it.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the intent. The author says he didn't use a snarky tone, just stated that it was obvious. However, the use of words like \"obviously\" can sometimes come off as dismissive, even if unintended. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt belittled. Even if the conclusion is commonly known, the delivery can impact how it's received.\n\nCommunication in relationships often hinges on empathy and understanding. The author's failure to consider her feelings, despite her expressing hurt, might be a red flag. He also mentions not caring when she explains why the word is offensive, which could indicate a lack of willingness to see her perspective. This could lead to further conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might genuinely not see the issue. He believes the conclusion is obvious, and as a psych major, he thought she would know it. However, even if that's the case, the way he phrased it might have made her feel like her initial learning experience wasn't valued. The key here is whether the author should have anticipated that his words could hurt her, regardless of his intent.\n\nThe author's response to her concerns by saying \"I don't care\" and needing her to not get offended about small things suggests that he's not prioritizing her emotional experience. In healthy relationships, both partners should validate each other's feelings, even if they don't fully agree. Dismissing someone's emotional response can erode trust and respect.\n\nSo, while the author might not have intended to hurt her, the impact of his words was real. The responsibility in communication isn't just about intent but also about recognizing the effect on the other person. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not taking her feelings into account and for not being open to her perspective, even if he doesn't see the issue as significant.\n"
