The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author saying something was \"obviously\" the case during a conversation with his girlfriend, which she found offensive. The author is defending himself by saying that the conclusion was indeed obvious and that as a psych major, she should have known.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author's intention wasn't to be snarky, but using \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive. Even if the conclusion is common knowledge, the way it's conveyed matters. The girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't find it obvious at the time she learned it. People's experiences and understanding can vary, so what's obvious to one might not be to another. \n\nThe author is not invalidating the fact that she felt hurt, but he's arguing that her feelings shouldn't have been hurt. However, in relationships, acknowledging the other person's feelings is key. Even if the author doesn't see the issue, his response of \"I don't care\" when she explained her hurt feelings is problematic. Dismissing her emotions, even if he didn't mean to, invalidates her experience. \n\nAlso, the author's insistence that she should get over it and not take things so personally might be contributing to the conflict. Communication in relationships requires empathy. Even if the conclusion was obvious, the way it was said and the subsequent response are important. The author's refusal to apologize and his stance that it's not a big thing might be seen as not prioritizing her feelings enough. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend could have handled the situation differently, maybe by explaining her feelings sooner rather than later. But the core issue here is about how the author's words made her feel. The use of \"obviously\" can be inherently condescending, regardless of intent. It's about perception and the impact on her, not just the intent. \n\nIn AITA situations, the community often looks at both the action and the impact. Even if the author had good intentions, if his words hurt her and he refused to acknowledge her feelings, he might be considered at fault. The fact that he's not willing to apologize and instead says she should just get over it shows a lack of empathy, which is a red flag in relationships. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions, while perhaps not malicious, were dismissive and invalidated his girlfriend's feelings. The key here is about respecting her perspective and showing empathy rather than being right about the content. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
