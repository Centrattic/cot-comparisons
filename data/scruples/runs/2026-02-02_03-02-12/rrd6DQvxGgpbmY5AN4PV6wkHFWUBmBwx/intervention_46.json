The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about using the word \"obviously\" during a discussion with his girlfriend, which made her feel hurt. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author said the experiment's conclusion was obvious, using \"obviously.\" His girlfriend was a psych major and had learned about the experiment in her class. She felt that using \"obviously\" made her feel dumb because she didn't realize it was obvious when she first learned it. \n\nThe author argues that the conclusion is well-known and obvious, so it was safe to assume she knew it. However, he didn't consider that she might have found it non-obvious at the time. The girlfriend felt invalidated and hurt by his comment, and when she tried to explain why, he dismissed her feelings by saying \"I don't care,\" even though he later apologized but still doesn't think she should have gotten hurt.\n\nNow, considering communication in relationships. The word \"obviously\" can be condescending, even if not intended. The author might have meant to acknowledge her knowledge, but the phrasing came off as dismissive. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt her experience wasn't respected. \n\nThe author's response of \"I don't care\" when she explained her feelings is a problem. Even if he disagrees with her perspective, dismissing her feelings invalidates her experience. In healthy relationships, it's important to validate each other's emotions even if you don't agree. The author's stance that she should \"get over it\" also suggests a lack of empathy.\n\nSo, the author may be in the wrong because he didn't consider her feelings and dismissed her when she tried to explain. Using \"obviously\" can be hurtful regardless of intent, and the way he responded worsened the situation.\n"
