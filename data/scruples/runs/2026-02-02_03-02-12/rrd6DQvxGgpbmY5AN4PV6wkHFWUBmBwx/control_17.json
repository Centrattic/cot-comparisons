The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for hurting their girlfriend's feelings by using the word \"obviously\" during a conversation about a psychology experiment.\n\nFirst, the author said the experiment's conclusion was obvious, which their girlfriend found offensive. The girlfriend felt it made her feel dumb because she didn't find it obvious when she first learned about it. The key here is the use of the word \"obviously.\" Even if the author didn't mean it snarkily, the word can come off as dismissive. The girlfriend is a psych major, so the author might have assumed she knew it, but people can have different perspectives on what's obvious. \n\nThe author downplays the situation by saying they don't care about her feelings being hurt and that it's not a big deal. They also tell the girlfriend to \"get over it,\" which shows a lack of empathy. The girlfriend's feelings are valid here because the word used made her feel invalidated. The author's response of not caring and dismissing her feelings as overreacting is problematic. Even if the conclusion was obvious, the delivery and the choice of words mattered in this context. \n\nThe author should have been more considerate of her feelings and maybe used a different phrasing. The fact that the author is unwilling to apologize and insists they're right suggests they're not taking her feelings seriously. So, in this case, the author is in the wrong.\n"
