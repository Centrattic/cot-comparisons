The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is at fault (AITA). The situation involves a disagreement between the author and his girlfriend over the use of the word \"obviously\" during a discussion about a psychology experiment.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: He thinks the experiment's conclusion was obvious and said so, not in a snarky way. He mentions that as a psych student, he assumed his girlfriend would have found it obvious too. He doesn't think he was wrong and even says his girlfriend overreacted. He's reluctant to apologize because he believes her feelings shouldn't have been hurt.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective: She felt hurt and offended because the word \"obviously\" made her feel dumb. She learned about the experiment in her class and found it cool at the time. The fact that he said it was obvious made her feel like her experience wasn't valid. She's asking for an apology, but he refuses, which is escalating the situation.\n\nNow, considering communication and empathy. The word \"obviously\" is often seen as dismissive. Even if the author didn't mean it that way, using such language can unintentionally hurt someone's feelings. The key here is the impact versus the intent. The girlfriend felt disrespected and devalued, and the author's response of not caring about her feelings (even if he later says he does) is problematic. Dismissing someone's valid emotional reaction as an overreaction can be hurtful and damaging to the relationship.\n\nAlso, the author's refusal to apologize and his stance that it's a \"safe\" assumption shows a lack of consideration for her emotional experience. Even if the conclusion was obvious to him, it's not a given that it was obvious to her. People have different experiences and learning processes. The fact that she was part of a class where it was taught doesn't mean she immediately understood its obviousness.\n\nMoreover, when she tried to explain why \"obviously\" was offensive, he responded with \"I don\u2019t care,\" which is a clear invalidation of her feelings. This is a critical point because it shows he isn't willing to see her perspective. In healthy relationships, both parties need to validate each other's feelings even when they disagree.\n\nThe author's argument that he wouldn't be offended if she said something similar to him is a form of the \"if I did it, it's okay\" fallacy. Everyone has different sensitivities, and what might be acceptable for one person doesn't mean it's acceptable for another. The focus should be on her feelings and his responsibility in the situation.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intent might not have been to hurt her, the effect was real. His refusal to acknowledge her feelings and the dismissive response of \"I don't care\" when she explained her perspective is where he's in the wrong. Relationships require empathy and validation, which he failed to provide here.\n"
