The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" in a conversation with their girlfriend. The girlfriend was a psychology major and mentioned an experiment. The author found the conclusion obvious and said so, which upset her.\n\nHmm, first, the key point is the use of \"obviously.\" Even if the conclusion is common knowledge or seems obvious to the speaker, using that word can be dismissive. People might feel their effort to understand or their initial lack of understanding is being belittled. The girlfriend felt stupid, so the author's statement had a negative impact.\n\nThe author says they didn't mean it in a snarky way, but the problem is in how it was received. It's not just about the intention; it's about the effect. The girlfriend's feelings were hurt, and the author is arguing that it's not a big deal. But invalidating her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and then telling her to not get offended about little things might be part of the issue. \n\nEven though the author didn't intend to be rude, the word \"obviously\" often comes off as condescending. The fact that the girlfriend didn't find it obvious at first might mean the author's comment was premature or dismissive of her experience. The author's response of not caring about her feelings could have escalated the situation. They should acknowledge her feelings, even if they don't fully agree. \n\nSo, the answer is probably A. The author is in the wrong because they used a potentially hurtful word and didn't validate their girlfriend's feelings, making the situation worse by their reaction. It's better to apologize and adjust communication to be more considerate, even if the conclusion was obvious.\n"
