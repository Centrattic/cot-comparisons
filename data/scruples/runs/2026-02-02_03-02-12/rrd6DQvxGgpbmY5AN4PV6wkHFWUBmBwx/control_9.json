The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" which hurt their girlfriend's feelings. They said the experiment's conclusion was obvious and didn't mean it snarkily. The girlfriend felt it made her feel dumb.\n\nHmm. The author thinks it's not a big deal because the conclusion really is obvious. They don't want to apologize, saying they don't care about people being offended. Wait, the problem is the use of \"obviously\" here. Even if the conclusion is obvious, using that word can come off as dismissive. The girlfriend is a psych major, but she didn't know it was obvious at first. So they took time to learn it, and him saying it's obvious might make her feel like she should have known it immediately.\n\nThe author is defensive, even when the girlfriend explains why it hurt. They say they don't care about people being offended and even say the girlfriend should get over it. That sounds dismissive of her feelings. They admit hurting her but don't think she should have been hurt. But emotions are valid even if the other person doesn't agree. The author isn't acknowledging her perspective, which is important in a relationship. Relationships require empathy and validating each other's feelings. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they're not taking responsibility and are invalidating their partner's emotions. Even if the conclusion is obvious, the way it was said affected her. So the answer is A.\n"
