The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" when discussing an experiment with their girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend is a psych major, and they were talking about an experiment. The author said the conclusion was obvious, which hurt her feelings. She felt that using \"obviously\" made her feel dumb. The author doesn't think they're wrong because the conclusion really is obvious and they thought as a psych major, she should have known it. They even said, \"I don't care\" when she explained her feelings, and now the girlfriend wants an apology, but the author refuses.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about communication and empathy. The author's intention wasn't to be rude, but the word choice might have been dismissive. Even if the conclusion is obvious to the author, the girlfriend might not have seen it that way at first. Using \"obviously\" can imply that the other person's lack of immediate understanding is a shortcoming. \n\nThe author is dismissing the girlfriend's feelings by saying \"I don't care\" when she explains why it hurt her. That's a red flag. Even if the author didn't mean to be condescending, the response of not caring about her feelings is a problem. Relationships require considering each other's emotions, not just the logic of the situation.\n\nAlso, the author is in a position where they should acknowledge that just because something is obvious to them doesn't mean it's obvious to others, even if the other person is a psych major. People have different experiences and learning processes. The girlfriend might have found it challenging or interesting when she first learned it, and the author's comment undermined her experience.\n\nThe author's refusal to apologize and telling the girlfriend to \"get over it\" shows a lack of empathy. It's important to validate feelings, even if you don't see them as valid. The author is prioritizing their own perspective over their partner's emotional experience, which is a key factor in relationship dynamics.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even though the author didn't intend to hurt, the way they responded and dismissed the girlfriend's feelings makes them at fault. The answer is A.\n"
