The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" in a discussion with his girlfriend. The girlfriend felt hurt because she thought the author was implying the experiment's conclusion was too simple, making her feel dumb. The author argues that the conclusion was obvious and that he didn't mean to be offensive. He also mentions he apologized but still thinks she's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is a psych major, so she might have expected that the experiment's conclusion wasn't obvious to her when she first learned it. The use of \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive, even if not intended. It's a common issue because people often interpret \"obviously\" as a judgment of their understanding. \n\nThe author says he didn't use it snarkily, just to state the obvious. However, the key point is the girlfriend's emotional response. Even if the author didn't mean to, the word might have been perceived as belittling. In relationships, it's important to consider how your words affect others, not just the intent. \n\nThe author also mentioned that when the girlfriend tried to explain why it was offensive, he responded with \"I don't care,\" which is definitely a problem. Invalidating her feelings by not caring, even if he didn't think he was wrong, can make things worse. Apologizing but not acknowledging her perspective might not be sufficient. \n\nThe author's stance is that the conclusion was obvious and that he doesn't think it's a big deal. However, the girlfriend's discomfort is valid. The situation isn't about who's right in terms of the experiment's conclusion but about communication and respect. Using \"obviously\" can be seen as minimizing her experience, which is hurtful regardless of the context. \n\nIn the end, the author might not have intended to hurt her, but the impact of his words did. The way he responded by not caring about her feelings is definitely part of the issue. So, the answer is A because the author is in the wrong for dismissing her feelings and using a term that can be inherently offensive.\n"
