The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend who got hurt when the author called a psychology experiment's conclusion obvious. The author used the word \"obviously\" which the girlfriend found offensive. The author is defending himself by saying it was obvious and that he didn't mean to be snarky. He even says he doesn't think he should have to apologize and that the girlfriend shouldn't get worked up over small things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the use of the word \"obviously.\" From what I know, using that word can come off as dismissive or condescending, even if not intended. The girlfriend is a psych major, so maybe she expected the author to recognize that she learned it in her class and that her reaction to it being obvious might be hurtful. The fact that she mentioned it was cool when she first learned it shows she took pride in understanding it. The author's dismissal might have undermined her feelings.\n\nThen, the author's response after being confronted. Instead of apologizing, he said \"I don't care\" about her feelings and told her not to get offended over little things. That sounds invalidating. The girlfriend's feelings are valid because she felt hurt. The author's refusal to acknowledge her feelings and insistence that she should just get over it is problematic. Even if the conclusion was obvious, the way he communicated it and the subsequent dismissal of her emotions are issues.\n\nThe key points here are about communication and empathy. The word \"obviously\" can be a trigger for many people, making them feel belittled. The fact that the girlfriend explained why it was offensive and the author still didn't care shows a lack of willingness to understand her perspective. Relationships require compromise and empathy, so not apologizing and dismissing her feelings might be seen as the author's fault.\n\nBut some might argue that if the conclusion was indeed obvious, the author didn't mean to hurt her. However, in relationships, intentions don't always align with the impact. Even if unintended, the hurt feelings are real. The author's refusal to apologize and his judgment about her overreacting is where he's wrong. So, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
