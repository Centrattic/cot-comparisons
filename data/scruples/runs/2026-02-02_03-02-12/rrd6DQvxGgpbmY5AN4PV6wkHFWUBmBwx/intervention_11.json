The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" in a conversation with his girlfriend. The girlfriend felt hurt because she thought the word implied that the conclusion was too simple, making her feel dumb. The author, however, argues that the conclusion was indeed obvious and that it was reasonable to assume his girlfriend, being a psych major, would know it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The use of \"obviously\" can be a sensitive term because it can come across as dismissive or condescending, even if unintended. The author claims he didn't say it in a snarky way, just stating his opinion. However, the girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt her feelings were hurt. The key here is whether the author's intent matters more than the impact he had.\n\nThe author also mentions that he doesn't think her feelings should have been hurt and that he doesn't care about the offense. This attitude of not validating her feelings, even after she expressed being hurt, could be a problem. Relationships often require empathy and understanding, even when one doesn't see the issue. The fact that he dismissed her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and told her to get over it shows a lack of consideration for her emotions.\n\nWhile the conclusion might be obvious to the author, the girlfriend's experience of learning it in her class and finding it cool at the time suggests that for her, it wasn't obvious. The author's assumption that she should have known it as a psych major could be where the problem lies. People can have different levels of knowledge and experiences, and assuming someone else's knowledge base can lead to hurt feelings.\n\nAdditionally, the author's refusal to apologize and his stance that it's a small thing might indicate a pattern of dismissing his partner's emotional needs. In relationships, it's important to acknowledge and respect each other's feelings, even if you don't fully agree. The fact that the girlfriend felt the need to explain why \"obviously\" is offensive and that the author invalidated her feelings by not caring could damage trust and emotional connection.\n\nSo, while the author might not have had malicious intent, the impact on his girlfriend is real and significant. The way he responded to her hurt feelings by not apologizing and pushing her to get over it is where he's likely in the wrong. The key issue here is not just the use of the word \"obviously,\" but his refusal to validate her emotions and his dismissive attitude towards her feelings.\n"
