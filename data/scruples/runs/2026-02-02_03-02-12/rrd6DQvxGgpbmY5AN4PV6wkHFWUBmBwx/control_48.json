The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who used the word \"obviously\" in a conversation with his girlfriend is at fault.\n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend is a psychology major and mentioned an experiment. The guy said the conclusion was obvious, which made her feel dumb. She explained that when she first learned about it, it wasn't obvious to her. He insisted it was obvious and didn't care that she was hurt, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, the key points here. The use of \"obviously\" can be a trigger for some people, making them feel belittled. Even if the speaker didn't mean it snarkily, the impact on the listener matters. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt her feelings were dismissed. The guy then dismisses her explanation by saying he doesn't care and tells her to get over it, which invalidates her emotions further.\n\nThe guy's argument is that the conclusion was obvious, and as a psych major, she should have known. But he's underestimating her experience. Just because someone is a major in a field doesn't mean every concept is immediately obvious to them. The experiment might have been a specific context where the conclusion wasn't obvious at first.\n\nHe also says he doesn't care about her feelings, which is a red flag. Even if he later says he does, the fact that he minimized her feelings and refused to apologize suggests a lack of empathy. The core issue is about communication and respect for her feelings. \n\nIn relationships, acknowledging the other person's emotions is crucial. Even if the intention wasn't malicious, the effect is what matters. By not apologizing and dismissing her feelings, he's failing to show the empathy needed to resolve the conflict. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions likely hurt his girlfriend unnecessarily, and his response of not caring about her feelings is problematic. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
