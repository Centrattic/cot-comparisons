The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" when discussing a psychology experiment with his girlfriend. He claims he didn't mean it in a snarky way and that the conclusion was obvious, so he thought it was safe to say. His girlfriend felt hurt because she thought he was making her feel dumb. The author says he doesn't care that she's hurt and doesn't think he should apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is a psych major, and the author assumed she would know the conclusion. Even if it's a well-known concept, the way he stated it might have been dismissive. The word \"obviously\" can come off as condescending, regardless of intent. People often use that word to belittle others' understanding, even if that's not the speaker's intention.\n\nThe author's response to her feelings is crucial here. He says he doesn't care about her feelings in this context and that she should get over it. That's a problem because it shows a lack of empathy. Even if he didn't mean to hurt her, dismissing her feelings as trivial is invalidating. Effective communication in a relationship requires acknowledging each other's emotions, not brushing them off.\n\nAlso, the fact that she found the experiment cool and didn't know it was obvious suggests that her experience of learning it was positive. By pointing out the \"obvious\" conclusion, he might have undermined her experience. The key here is that everyone has different learning experiences and what seems obvious to one person might not be to another, even within the same field.\n\nThe author's refusal to apologize and his stance that her feelings shouldn't have been hurt indicates a lack of willingness to see her perspective. Relationships require compromise and understanding. Even if the conclusion was indeed obvious, the way it was communicated caused hurt, and the author's response exacerbated the situation by not validating her feelings.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is in the wrong because he used a term that can be condescending and then dismissed his girlfriend's emotional response, which is a significant issue in maintaining a healthy relationship.\n"
