The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again.\n\nSo the situation is about a couple discussing a psychology experiment. The girlfriend (GF) explains an experiment she learned about, and the author says the conclusion is obvious. The GF takes offense because she felt stupid when he used \"obviously.\" They argue about it, and the author is now asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author used the word \"obviously,\" which he claims wasn't meant to be snarky. But the GF felt hurt because she didn't find it obvious when she first learned it. The author is defending his use of the word, saying it's a well-known concept, and that as a psych major, she should have known it's obvious. He also mentions not caring about her feelings and not wanting to apologize, which escalated the situation.\n\nFrom what I know, using \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive, even if not intended that way. The GF's reaction is valid because she felt her experience (not finding it obvious at the time) was invalidated. The author's response, especially saying \"I don't care\" and refusing to apologize, shows a lack of empathy. Even if the author doesn't see the problem, his partner's feelings are important. Relationships require mutual respect and consideration. The author dismissing her feelings and refusing to acknowledge her perspective is problematic. He should apologize and validate her feelings, even if he disagrees with her reaction. \n\nSo the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
