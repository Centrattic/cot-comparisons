The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" when discussing a psychology experiment with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the context: The girlfriend is a psych major and was excited about an experiment. The author said the conclusion was obvious. She felt hurt because \"obviously\" made her feel dumb. He thinks she's overreacting because the conclusion really is obvious.\n\nNow, considering social norms and communication. The word \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive, even if not intended that way. It's a common point of contention in discussions. The key here is intent vs. impact. The author didn't mean to be snarky but didn't consider how it might sound. Even if the conclusion is obvious to him, it might not be to her, especially if she was just learning about it. Using \"obviously\" in that situation could negate her experience of learning something new.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt hurt. The author's response was to not apologize and to dismiss her feelings by saying he doesn't care that she's offended. That's problematic. Even if he didn't mean to be hurtful, the fact that he hurt her feelings and then refused to acknowledge her emotions is where he's in the wrong. Relationships require empathy and validating each other's feelings, even if you don't see eye to eye. His insistence that her reaction was too much and that he doesn't care about her feelings (even if he does) shows a lack of emotional support. So, the answer is A.\n"
