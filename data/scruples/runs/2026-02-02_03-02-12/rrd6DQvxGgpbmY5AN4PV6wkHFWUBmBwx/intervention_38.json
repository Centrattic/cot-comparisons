The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hurting their girlfriend's feelings by using the word \"obviously\" in a discussion about a psychology experiment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author says they didn't use a snarky tone and just stated that the conclusion was obvious. The girlfriend felt it was offensive because she didn't find it obvious when she first learned it, which made her feel dumb. The key here is whether the author's use of \"obviously\" was dismissive or condescending.\n\nIn relationships, communication styles matter. Even if the author didn't mean to be hurtful, the effect on the girlfriend was negative. The word \"obviously\" can sometimes come off as belittling, suggesting that the other person didn't understand something that's supposed to be clear. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt her feelings were invalidated when she explained why she was hurt. The author then dismissed her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and later told her to not get offended by little things, which could be seen as minimizing her experience.\n\nEven if the conclusion was indeed obvious to the author, the fact that the girlfriend took offense is important. The author's refusal to apologize and their insistence that it's not a big deal might indicate a lack of empathy. In such situations, it's crucial to acknowledge the other person's feelings, even if one doesn't fully agree with the offense taken. The author's response of \"I don't care\" when the girlfriend expressed her hurt feelings shows a disregard for her emotional state. \n\nAdditionally, the author's argument that they wouldn't be offended if the roles were reversed doesn't account for the different emotional reactions people might have. The girlfriend's hurt isn't about being right about the experiment's conclusion but about feeling disrespected in the interaction.\n\nSo, while the author might not have intended harm, their actions and subsequent dismissal of the girlfriend's feelings contribute to the problem. The core issue is the lack of consideration for her perspective and the failure to apologize, which are significant in maintaining a respectful relationship. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
