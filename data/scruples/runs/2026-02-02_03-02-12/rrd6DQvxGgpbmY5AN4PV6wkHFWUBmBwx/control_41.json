The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple discussing a psychology experiment. The boyfriend says the conclusion was obvious, and the girlfriend is hurt because he used the word \"obviously,\" which made her feel dumb.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The boyfriend's intention wasn't to be snarky, just stating his opinion. However, the girlfriend felt offended. The main issue here is whether using \"obviously\" was appropriate, even if the conclusion was indeed obvious to him.\n\nCommunication in relationships often involves sensitivity to each other's feelings. Even if the conclusion was obvious to him, the girlfriend's reaction is valid if she felt that her experience of learning it (and not finding it obvious at the time) was being dismissed. The word \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive, regardless of the speaker's intent. \n\nThe boyfriend then dismisses her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and insists that it's not a big deal. This invalidates her emotions, which is a common issue in such conflicts. Even if he doesn't see the problem, his response of not caring and pushing for her to \"get over it\" is likely to escalate the situation. \n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that she found the experiment cool when she learned it, and not seeing it as obvious at the time. The boyfriend's use of \"obviously\" might have undermined her experience of learning and understanding the concept. People can have different levels of familiarity or insight even in their own field, so assuming she should have found it obvious is an assumption that's not necessarily fair. \n\nIn terms of whether he's in the wrong, the key factors are: using language that can be perceived as dismissive, invalidating her feelings when she expressed them, and refusing to apologize. Even if he didn't mean to hurt her, the impact is real. In relationships, it's important to acknowledge how one's words affect the partner, even if unintentionally. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because his response to her feelings was dismissive and he didn't consider the effect of his words, even if the word itself was just a statement of fact. The key is about how his reaction contributed to her feeling hurt and not being validated.\n"
