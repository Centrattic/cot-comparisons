The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple discussing a psychology experiment. The girlfriend felt hurt when the author said the experiment's conclusion was \"obvious.\" The author thinks he's not wrong because the conclusion is well-known, and he didn't mean to be snarky. The girlfriend felt she was being made to feel dumb. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of both parties. The author used the word \"obviously,\" which can be seen as dismissive even if not intended. The girlfriend is a psych major, so maybe she was proud of learning the experiment and felt her experience was being minimized. The author's response of \"I don't care\" when she explained how it hurt her feelings is a red flag. That comes off as invalidating her feelings, which can be really hurtful in a relationship. \n\nEven if the conclusion was obvious to the author, it might not have been to the girlfriend when she first learned it. People can have different reactions to what's obvious. The key here is empathy. The author didn't acknowledge her feelings, even after she explained why it was hurtful. Relationships require validating each other's emotions, even if the person thinks the emotion is overblown. \n\nThe author's refusal to apologize and his comment that she should just get over it shows a lack of consideration. It's not just about the word \"obviously\" but how the author handled the conflict. Dismissing someone's feelings to be a \"big thing\" can damage trust and communication in a relationship. \n\nSo, even if the author didn't have bad intentions, his actions and response were hurtful. The fact that he's a psych major might mean he should be more aware of how language affects others. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here. Answer A.\n"
