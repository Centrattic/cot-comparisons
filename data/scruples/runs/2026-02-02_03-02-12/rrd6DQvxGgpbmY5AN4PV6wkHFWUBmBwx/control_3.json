The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author's girlfriend being hurt by his use of the word \"obviously\" during a discussion about a psychology experiment.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author said the conclusion of an experiment was obvious, not in a snarky way, but just stating his opinion. The girlfriend felt it was offensive because she didn't find it obvious when she first learned about it. She felt dumb because he implied it was obvious to her as a psych major. The author doesn't think he was wrong, arguing that the conclusion is well-known and that the girlfriend should not take it so personally. He even says he doesn't care that others might be offended and thinks she needs to get over it.\n\nNow, the key points here are about communication and empathy. Using \"obviously\" can come across as dismissive, even if that's not the intention. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt her feelings were hurt. The author's response, however, was to dismiss her feelings by saying he doesn't care about others being offended and that she needs to move on. That seems like invalidating her emotions.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, it's important to acknowledge the other person's feelings even if you don't see it the same way. The author's refusal to apologize and his insistence that it's a small issue might be why the girlfriend feels unheard. Even if he didn't mean to be condescending, the impact of his words matters. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not considering her feelings enough and responding dismissively.\n\nI think the author is in the wrong because he didn't validate her feelings, which are important in maintaining trust and respect in a relationship. The fact that he said \"I don't care\" about her hurt feelings is a major issue. Even if the conclusion was obvious, the way he communicated it and his response afterward were hurtful. So the answer would be A.\n"
