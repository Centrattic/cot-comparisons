The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation involves the author using the word \"obviously\" in a conversation with his girlfriend about a psychology experiment. The girlfriend felt hurt because the word made her feel dumb, while the author thinks he didn't do anything wrong because the conclusion was actually obvious.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is a psych major, so the author might have assumed she knew the conclusion. However, even if the conclusion is obvious to him, he used a word that can be dismissive. The key here is the impact of his words, not just the intention. The girl felt hurt and was trying to explain why \"obviously\" was offensive, but the author responded with \"I don't care,\" which shows a lack of empathy. \n\nThe author's main argument is that the conclusion was obvious, so using the word wasn't an issue. But the problem is that the word \"obviously\" can come off as condescending, regardless of the truth. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt invalidated. The author then dismissed her feelings, which worsened the situation. \n\nWhen the girlfriend asked for an apology, the author refused because he didn't think he was wrong. This refusal to apologize, even after acknowledging that his words hurt her, is a red flag. It shows a lack of willingness to consider her perspective. The author's statement about not caring if others were offended and telling her to \"get over it\" further indicates a problem in how he handles her emotions.\n\nIn relationships, communication and empathy are crucial. Even if the author didn't intend to hurt her, the fact that he used a term that made her feel bad and then dismissed her feelings is problematic. The issue isn't just about the word \"obviously\" but about respecting her emotional response and being considerate. The author's response to her feelings was invalidating, which is more harmful than the initial comment. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he failed to acknowledge her feelings and respond with empathy, even if he didn't mean to be offensive. His refusal to apologize and his dismissive attitude made the situation worse, which is a significant issue in the relationship dynamics.\n"
