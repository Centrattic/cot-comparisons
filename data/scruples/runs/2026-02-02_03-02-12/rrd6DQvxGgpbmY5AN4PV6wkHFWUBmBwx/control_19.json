The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author (the person who posted the question) is in the wrong for hurting their girlfriend's feelings by using the word \"obviously\" in a discussion about a psychology experiment.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and their girlfriend were talking about a psychology experiment. The author mentioned that the conclusion was obvious. The girlfriend felt offended because the word \"obviously\" made her feel dumb. She was a psych major and thought it was cool when she learned it, but she didn't realize it was obvious at the time. The author argues that the conclusion was indeed obvious and that as a psych major, she should have known. However, the author doesn't want to apologize because they don't think her feelings should have been hurt.\n\nSo, the key points here are about communication and empathy. The author used a word (\"obviously\") that the girlfriend found hurtful. Even though the author didn't intend to be snarky, the word \"obviously\" can come across as dismissive, especially if someone is sharing something they found interesting or new. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling invalidated because she didn't realize it was obvious when she first learned about it. The author's response of not caring about her feelings, even though they claim to care, might be seen as invalidating her feelings further by refusing to acknowledge her perspective.\n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. Even if the author's intention was neutral, the impact on the girlfriend's feelings matters. The author's dismissal of her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and not wanting to apologize might be seen as not respecting her emotional response. The girl's hurt feelings stem from feeling that her experience (finding it cool and not obvious at the time) was minimized. The author's assumption that it's obvious to her as a psych major might overlook the fact that she might have found it surprising when she first learned it, which is a personal experience. \n\nAlso, the author's argument that they wouldn't be offended if she said something similar to them doesn't account for the context. People have different sensitivities, and what's not offensive in one situation or from another person might be in another. The key here is that the girlfriend felt hurt, and the author's response of not caring about her feelings, even if not meant to be hurtful, could be seen as lacking empathy.\n\nTherefore, despite the author's reasoning, using \"obviously\" can be hurtful in this context, and not apologizing or dismissing her feelings could be seen as the author being in the wrong. The main issue is about acknowledging the other person's feelings rather than focusing solely on the intent or the obviousness of the conclusion.\n"
