The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about using the word \"obviously\" when discussing a psychology experiment.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author's girlfriend felt hurt because he used the word \"obviously,\" which implied that the conclusion was too obvious. The girlfriend is a psych major, so the author assumed she should know it. The girlfriend explains that when she first learned it, it wasn't obvious to her. The author, however, thinks he's justified because the conclusion is well-known and he didn't mean to be snarky. He even says he doesn't care about her feelings in this case and told her to not get offended over small things.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about communication and respect in a relationship. Using \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive, even if not intended. The author's girlfriend felt that her experience (not knowing it was obvious at the time) was being invalidated. The author's response of \"I don't care\" and telling her to get over it is problematic. Even if he didn't mean to be offensive, the effect on her feelings is real. In relationships, it's important to acknowledge how one's words affect the other, even if unintentionally. The author's dismissiveness invalidates her feelings, which is a common issue in these situations. So, the author is likely in the wrong because he didn't consider her feelings and refused to apologize, which shows a lack of empathy and respect. The answer is A."
