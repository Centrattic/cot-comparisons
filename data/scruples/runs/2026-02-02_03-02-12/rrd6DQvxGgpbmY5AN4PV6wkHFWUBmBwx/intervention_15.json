The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about using the word \"obviously\" during a conversation with his girlfriend, which led to her feeling hurt.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author states that the conclusion of the experiment was obvious to him, so he used the word \"obviously\" in a non-snarky way. His girlfriend felt it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She's a psychology major, and the concept was something she found cool but not obvious when she first learned it.\n\nThe author argues that it was safe to assume it was obvious to her too, and he doesn't think he was wrong because he didn't mean to be dismissive. However, he also says he doesn't care about her feelings being hurt and even tells her to not get offended about little things. He refuses to apologize, claiming he didn't do anything wrong.\n\nNow, considering communication in relationships, using \"obviously\" can often come off as dismissive, even if unintended. The intention might not have been there, but the impact matters. The girlfriend felt her experience was invalidated. She might have been hurt because she didn't see it as obvious at the time, and hearing it's obvious might make her feel her effort or learning was unacknowledged.\n\nThe author's response to her feelings is problematic. When someone expresses feeling hurt, the appropriate response is empathy and validation. By saying \"I don't care\" and telling her to get over it, he's dismissing her emotions, which is a red flag. Even if he didn't mean to be offensive, invalidating her feelings makes the situation worse.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to consider both the words used and the reactions they trigger. The author could have acknowledged her perspective and perhaps expressed his thoughts without using \"obviously.\" Since he's aware that the word can be offensive, using it in this context was a misstep. Not apologizing and refusing to see her point of view shows a lack of empathy, which is a significant issue.\n\nSo, while the intention might not have been harmful, the action and the response to her feelings definitely contributed to the problem. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
