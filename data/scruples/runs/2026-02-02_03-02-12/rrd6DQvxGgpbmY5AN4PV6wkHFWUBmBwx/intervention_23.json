The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong after using the word \"obviously\" during a conversation with their girlfriend. The girlfriend felt hurt and thought the word was offensive, making her feel dumb. The author, on the other hand, doesn't think they did anything wrong and even says they don't care about the feelings part.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is a psychology major and learned about the experiment in her classes. The author said the conclusion was obvious, not in a snarky way, just stating their opinion. The key here is the word \"obviously\" and how it's perceived. In communication, using such words can come off as dismissive, even if not intended. The girlfriend felt that way, which is valid because people's reactions are based on their feelings, not just the words themselves.\n\nThe author's response when the girlfriend expressed her hurt feelings was dismissive. They said \"I don't care\" and even told her to not get offended over small things. This part is crucial because even if the author didn't mean to be offensive, their response didn't acknowledge her feelings. Emotional support in relationships involves validating each other's emotions, even when you don't agree with their reaction. By not apologizing and instead telling her to move on, the author might be seen as not prioritizing her emotional needs.\n\nAlso, the author's argument that it was \"safe to assume it was obvious to her\" might not take into account that everyone has different experiences and levels of knowledge, even within the same field. What's obvious to one person might not be to another, regardless of their expertise. The fact that she found it cool when she first learned it suggests that she didn't consider it obvious at the time, so the author's use of the word could have invalidated her experience.\n\nThe author's unwillingness to apologize and their stance that the feelings shouldn't have been hurt in the first place could be seen as a lack of empathy. In healthy relationships, acknowledging and apologizing for hurt feelings is important. The author's response might have escalated the situation by not validating her feelings and instead dismissing them, which can lead to further hurt and resentment.\n\nSo, considering all these points, while the initial use of \"obviously\" might not have been malicious, the author's response and lack of validation for their girlfriend's feelings likely contributed to the issue. The core of the problem is not just the word used but how the author handled the girlfriend's reaction. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not showing empathy and validating their partner's emotions.\n"
