The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is at fault (AITA). The scenario involves a disagreement between a couple where the guy uses the word \"obviously\" when discussing a psychology experiment, which upsets his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both perspectives. The guy thinks the conclusion was obvious, so using \"obvious\" was just stating a fact. He didn't mean to be snarky or condescending. However, the girlfriend feels that using \"obviously\" made her feel dumb because she didn't find it obvious at first when she learned it. She's a psych major, so she might have felt that her knowledge or understanding was being belittled.\n\nNow, considering communication in relationships. Even if the guy didn't intend to be hurtful, the impact on his partner matters. The word \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive, implying that the other person should know this already. Even if the conclusion is well-known, someone's personal experience of learning it might not align with that. The girlfriend's reaction stems from feeling invalidated in her experience of learning the concept.\n\nThe guy's response to her feelings is important. He acknowledges she's hurt but isn't willing to apologize, thinking it's a small thing. He's also telling her not to get offended over minor issues. This could be seen as invalidating her emotions, which might escalate the conflict. In healthy relationships, validating each other's feelings is crucial, even if you don't agree with the perception.\n\nThe key points here are intent vs. impact and validation. While the guy's intent wasn't malicious, the impact was hurtful. The girlfriend's feelings are valid because she felt disrespected. The guy dismissing her reaction could lead to resentment. Even if the conclusion is objectively obvious, the way it's communicated matters in a relationship context.\n\nSo, the question is whether the guy is wrong for not apologizing despite the hurt caused. The answer hinges on whether intent or impact takes precedence. In most relationship advice, the impact is what's important, and both parties should work to communicate in ways that respect each other's feelings. The author's refusal to apologize and his dismissal of her feelings might be seen as the problem here, even if his initial words weren't meant to hurt.\n"
