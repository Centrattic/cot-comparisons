The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the situation is that the author's girlfriend was talking about a psychology experiment she learned in class. The author said the conclusion was obvious, using the word \"obviously.\" The girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't find it obvious at the time and felt the author was making her feel dumb. The author thinks the girlfriend was overreacting and doesn't want to apologize because he believed it was obvious and the word wasn't meant to be offensive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the use of the word \"obviously.\" From what I know, \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive or condescending, even if the intent isn't there. It's often seen as minimizing someone else's perspective or experience. The girlfriend is a psych major, so maybe she expected the author to be more aware of how such language can affect people.\n\nThe author assumes that because the conclusion is well-known, the girlfriend should have found it obvious. However, the key point here is that she didn't find it obvious when she first learned it. The author's comment might have overlooked her personal experience and undermined her feelings. Even if the conclusion is common knowledge now, her experience of learning it wasn't obvious to her at the time. The author's use of \"obviously\" might have invalidated her experience of learning something new.\n\nThe author also mentions that he doesn't care about the girlfriend's feelings in this context, which is problematic. Relationships require mutual respect and empathy. Dismissing someone's feelings, even if you believe they're overreacting, can damage trust and communication. The author's refusal to apologize and his insistence that the girlfriend should get over it suggests a lack of willingness to acknowledge her perspective.\n\nAnother angle is the importance of validating others' emotions. Even if the author doesn't see the issue, the girlfriend does, and it's important to recognize that people have different sensitivities. The author's response of \"I don't care\" when she explains her feelings is a clear example of not respecting her emotional experience. This can escalate conflicts rather than resolving them.\n\nIn summary, even if the author didn't mean to be hurtful, the impact of his words was to make his girlfriend feel stupid. The key here is the effect of his words, not just his intent. Relationships often require making small adjustments in communication to respect each other's feelings. The author's refusal to consider his part in the hurt feelings and his dismissive attitude towards her emotions are clear indicators that he is in the wrong.\n"
