The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me break this down. The situation is about a couple discussing a psychology experiment. The girlfriend mentions an experiment's conclusion, and the guy says it's obvious. She gets hurt because he used the word \"obviously,\" feeling it makes her seem dumb. The author is saying that the conclusion is indeed well-known and obvious, so he doesn't see why she's upset. He's not apologizing, thinking it's not a big deal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the girlfriend. She's a psych major, so she might have learned this in class, but she didn't find it obvious when she first learned it. The word \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive, even if the speaker doesn't intend it that way. The author might have meant to acknowledge that the conclusion is common knowledge, but the way he phrased it could have made her feel her reaction was belittled. \n\nThe key point here is about perception and communication. Even if the author didn't mean to be condescending, the girlfriend's feelings were hurt. In relationships, it's important to be considerate of how your words affect others. The author's insistence that he's right and that she's overreacting could be seen as invalidating her feelings. When someone says \"I don't care\" after being told their words hurt, that can escalate the situation. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might genuinely not see the issue. He believes the conclusion is obvious and that as a psych major, she should have known it. However, even experts might not find everything obvious at first. The fact that she found it cool when she first learned it suggests it wasn't obvious to her then. So the author's comment could have undermined her experience.\n\nThe author's response to her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and insisting she should just get over it is problematic. In a healthy relationship, both partners should validate each other's emotions, even if they don't fully agree. Dismissing someone's feelings as overreacting can lead to resentment. The author should consider apologizing and understanding why the word \"obviously\" was hurtful, even if he didn't mean it that way. \n\nSo, while the author might not have had malicious intent, his words and the way he responded to her hurt feelings contributed to the problem. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
