The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author saying an experiment's conclusion was \"obviously\" the case, and their girlfriend feeling hurt and offended. The author doesn't think they're wrong because they believe the conclusion was obvious and that the girlfriend as a psych major should have known it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author used the word \"obviously,\" which the girlfriend found offensive. The key point is whether the author is at fault for using that word. The author argues that the conclusion is indeed obvious and that the girlfriend should have known, but the girlfriend felt it made her feel dumb.\n\nI remember that in communication, the word \"obviously\" can often come across as dismissive or belittling, even if the speaker doesn't intend it that way. The intention vs. perception might be a factor here. The author might not have meant to be snarky, but the effect on the listener was negative. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction is important. She explained that when she first learned about the experiment, it wasn't obvious to her. So the author's assumption that it was obvious to her now might not hold, especially since she might have had a different experience when she first encountered it. The author's dismissal of her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and not apologizing could be seen as invalidating her emotions. \n\nEven though the author claims to care about her feelings, the response of trying to justify their words instead of empathizing could be problematic. Relationships often require both parties to validate each other's feelings, even if they don't fully agree. The author's insistence that it's not a big deal and that the girlfriend should \"get over it\" might indicate a lack of sensitivity to her emotional state. \n\nSo, considering these points, even if the author didn't intend to hurt, the fact that their words caused hurt and they dismissed the girlfriend's feelings might make them at fault. The answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because the use of \"obviously\" was hurtful, and the author didn't handle the situation with enough empathy.\n"
