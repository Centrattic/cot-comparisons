The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a disagreement where the author used the word \"obviously\" in a discussion with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the key points here are communication and empathy. The author says they didn't mean to sound condescending when they said the experiment's conclusion was obvious. However, the girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't see it as obvious when she first learned it. The author is arguing that the conclusion is really obvious and that as a psychology major, she should have known that. But the girlfriend is hurt because she felt her feelings were disregarded.\n\nThe author's main defense is that they didn't mean to be offensive and that they don't think an apology is necessary. They also mention that they don't care about others' reactions to the word \"obviously.\" However, the girlfriend feels that using that word made her feel stupid, and the author's refusal to apologize has led to her feeling that he doesn't care about her feelings.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to consider how your words affect others, even if the intention isn't there. The word \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive, especially in contexts where the other person might not have known something was obvious. The author's insistence that it's obvious and that the girlfriend should have known it shows a lack of empathy. Even if the conclusion is well-known, the girlfriend's experience of learning it and not seeing it as obvious is valid. The author's refusal to acknowledge her feelings and his dismissive attitude (\"I don't care\") likely exacerbated the situation.\n\nThe author also mentions that he doesn't think it's a big deal and tells the girlfriend to not get offended over little things. This minimizes her feelings, which is a common issue in conflicts where one person doesn't see the other's perspective. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling invalidated, and the author's response of trying to invalidate her feelings by saying it's not a big thing is counterproductive.\n\nIn conclusion, even though the author might not have intended to be hurtful, the impact on his girlfriend is real. In such cases, it's important to apologize and validate her feelings, even if the issue seems minor. The author's refusal to apologize and his dismissive attitude suggest that he is in the wrong because he isn't showing the necessary empathy and consideration for her feelings in the relationship.\n"
