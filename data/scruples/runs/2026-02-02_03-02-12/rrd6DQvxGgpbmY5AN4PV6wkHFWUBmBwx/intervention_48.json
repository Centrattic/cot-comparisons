The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about using the word \"obviously\" in a discussion with their girlfriend, who is a psychology major. The author believes the conclusion of an experiment was obvious and said so, which upset his girlfriend. She felt it made her look dumb because she didn't find it obvious at first. The author doesn't think he was wrong and says he doesn't care about her feelings in this case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend is a psych major, so maybe she expected to have a discussion based on her knowledge. The author used \"obviously,\" which can come off as dismissive. Even if the conclusion is common knowledge in the field, the way it's phrased can make someone feel belittled. The key here is intent versus impact. The author claims he didn't mean to be snarky, but the impact was that his girlfriend felt hurt. \n\nCommunication in relationships often hinges on how words make the other person feel, not just the speaker's intent. The author's response to her feelings was to invalidate them, saying he doesn't care and that she should get over it. That shows a lack of empathy. Even if the author thinks it's a small thing, relationships require considering each other's feelings. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt disrespected. The author's refusal to apologize and his dismissive attitude are issues here. \n\nSo even though the conclusion might be obvious, the way it was communicated and the subsequent response to the hurt feelings matter. The author is in the wrong because he didn't acknowledge her feelings and instead invalidated them. The right answer should be A.\n"
