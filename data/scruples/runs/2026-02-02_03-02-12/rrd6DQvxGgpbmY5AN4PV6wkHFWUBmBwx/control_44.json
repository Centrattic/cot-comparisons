The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author and their girlfriend were discussing a psychology experiment. The author found the conclusion obvious and said so, using the word \"obviously.\" The girlfriend felt hurt because the word made her feel dumb. She explained that when she first learned about it, it wasn't obvious to her. The author, on the other hand, thought it was a well-known concept and assumed she would find it obvious too. The girlfriend is upset and wants an apology, but the author doesn't think they should have to apologize because they don't think \"obviously\" was offensive in this context. The author also says they don't care about her feelings in this case and told the girlfriend to not get offended over little things.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about communication and empathy. The word \"obviously\" can be perceived as dismissive or condescending, especially in a relationship. Even if the author didn't mean it that way, the girlfriend felt hurt. The author's response to her feelings is important here. They dismissed her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and told her to get over it. That seems pretty harsh.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the conclusion was obvious and that as a psych major, the girlfriend should have known it. But just because it's a well-known concept doesn't mean that everyone finds it obvious. People have different learning experiences and prior knowledge. The girlfriend might have had a different perspective when she first encountered the experiment, and the author's comment invalidated her experience.\n\nThe author also thinks that the girlfriend is overreacting and that this shouldn't be a big deal. However, the way they responded by invalidating her feelings (\"she should have just gotten over it\") shows a lack of empathy. Even if the author didn't intend to hurt her, the impact is what matters here. Relationships require both parties to respect each other's feelings, even if they don't see things the same way.\n\nAnother angle is the use of the word \"obviously\" itself. In many contexts, that word is a red flag for condescension. Even if the author was neutral, the choice of words might have been the trigger. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt disrespected. The author's refusal to apologize and dismissing her feelings makes it more about them not acknowledging the hurt caused, which is a bigger issue.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions, while maybe not malicious, were inconsiderate. They didn't take into account how their words could be received and responded poorly when confronted. The girlfriend's feelings are legitimate, and the author's dismissal of those feelings shows a lack of respect and empathy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
