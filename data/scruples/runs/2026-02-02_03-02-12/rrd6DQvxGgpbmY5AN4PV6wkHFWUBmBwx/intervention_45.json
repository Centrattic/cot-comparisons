The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author saying something was \"obvious\" to their girlfriend, which upset her. The author is defending their use of the word \"obviously\" because they thought the conclusion was well-known, but the girlfriend felt it was condescending and made her feel dumb.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author's intention was not to be snarky but just to state their opinion. However, the girlfriend's feelings were hurt. The author acknowledges that \"obviously\" can be offensive in general but believes it wasn't in this case. They also mention that as a psych major, they assumed she would find it obvious, which might not account for her personal experience when she first learned it.\n\nCommunication in relationships often hinges on how things are said, not just the words themselves. Even if the author didn't mean to be dismissive, the girlfriend felt that way. The author's refusal to apologize and their statement about not caring about her feelings (even if they later say they do) could be a red flag. Dismissing someone's feelings as overreacting can be hurtful and might lead to more conflict. The author's stance that she should \"just get over it\" suggests a lack of empathy for her perspective.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might genuinely not understand why the word was offensive. However, in relationships, it's important to validate each other's emotions, even if you don't agree with the interpretation. The fact that the girlfriend tried to explain her feelings and the author dismissed that by saying \"I don't care\" (even if they later apologize) shows a breakdown in communication. The author's insistence that it's a small thing and that the girlfriend shouldn't take offense might come across as not respecting her feelings enough.\n\nSo, while the author may not have intended to hurt her, the impact is still important. In such scenarios, being considerate of the other person's emotional experience is crucial. The use of \"obviously\" can often be a trigger because it minimizes the recipient's experience. Even if the author thinks it's obvious, the way they communicated it caused harm. The key here is empathy and validation. The author's refusal to acknowledge her feelings, despite her explaining why they were hurt, suggests they are not considering her perspective adequately. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because they didn't validate her feelings and instead dismissed them, which can erode trust and emotional safety in the relationship.\n"
