Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend making a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods, then implying the author wishes she had a penis. She responds that she doesn't want male genitals because they seem uncomfortable, and he gets offended, calling her sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The boyfriend made a dismissive comment about periods and women's experiences, which is already problematic. Then he made a joke about women wishing they had penises, which can be seen as undermining women's experiences. The author's response is based on her observations of his behavior and her own preferences. She's expressing her honest opinion about body autonomy and comfort.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction to her statement as sexist is interesting. If he's pointing out that she's making a generalization about male anatomy, maybe he's right in that she's making a broad statement. But given the context of him trivializing her experience with periods, it seems like he's being dismissive of her valid concerns. The author isn't attacking him personally, just stating her perspective based on what she sees. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's initial comments about periods being a downside and implying women want to be men could be seen as sexist too. So the author is pushing back against that. Her response is a form of self-expression about her own body and preferences. The boyfriend's offense might be more about defensiveness than her actual words. \n\nIn terms of whether she's in the wrong: if she's expressing her genuine feelings without attacking him, and the boyfriend is being overly sensitive or not taking responsibility for his initial dismissive remarks, then she's probably not in the wrong. The key is mutual respect in the conversation. If he's not respecting her experience with periods, her response is a reasonable pushback. \n\nSo the answer would be B - the author is not in the wrong. She's standing up for her own perspective in response to his comments. His reaction seems disproportionate and possibly deflecting from his own problematic behavior.\n"
