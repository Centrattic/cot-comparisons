Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods and said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author replies \"no, not really,\" explains that male genitals seem uncomfortable, and mentions the boyfriend's habit of scratching or adjusting his genital area. The boyfriend then gets upset and says she's being sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the dynamics here. The boyfriend starts by making a comment that could be seen as dismissive or minimally degrading about periods. Then he makes a joke suggesting the author might prefer having a penis. She responds honestly, stating her reasons, which include physical discomfort and the constant maintenance he does. He reacts by calling her sexist and storming off.\n\nSo, the key points are: the initial comment from the boyfriend might be the catalyst. Making a joke about someone's body in a way that could be seen as devaluing their experience (periods are a real physical process, not something to be glad to avoid). Then when the author responds with her genuine feelings about male anatomy, he takes offense and labels her as sexist, which is a serious accusation that can shut down conversation.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? The boyfriend's initial comment was probably the more problematic part. He's making a light-hearted jab about something the author is experiencing, which could be seen as insensitive. The author's response is a factual expression of her discomfort. The boyfriend's reaction of calling her sexist is likely a deflection or a way to invalidate her feelings. The author isn't making a sexist generalization; she's sharing her personal experience and observation. So, the boyfriend's reaction is misplaced. The author is not in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
