Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend making a comment about not having to deal with periods, and then the author responds by saying she doesn't want a penis because it's uncomfortable. He gets offended and calls her sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend made a flippant remark about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods, and then joked about the woman wishing she had a penis. The author's response was based on her observations of male genitalia being uncomfortable, like having to scratch or adjust them. She's expressing her personal opinion based on her experiences and observations.\n\nNow, the boyfriend took offense and called her sexist. Is his reaction valid? Sexism usually involves prejudice against someone due to their sex. Here, the author is making a personal statement about her preferences, not making a generalized negative statement about men or their bodies. She's talking about her own perspective on having a penis, which is a personal choice, not a judgment of men.\n\nThe boyfriend's initial comments about periods could be seen as dismissive of her experience. He was trashing periods and vaginas, which might have led the author to push back. She's pointing out the potential downsides of male anatomy, which he finds offensive. But his reaction seems more about feeling attacked rather than her being sexist.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? She's expressing her honest feelings. Even if her words might be seen as humorous or a bit blunt, she's not making a sexist statement. The boyfriend's reaction is about being defensive rather than her making a sexist comment. So, the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
