Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement between the author and her boyfriend about whether she would want to have a penis. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend makes a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods and says something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds that she doesn't, explaining that male genitals seem uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend gets offended, calling her sexist, and storms off.\n\nThe key points here are the boyfriend's initial comment, the author's response, and the boyfriend's reaction. The boyfriend's statement seems dismissive and possibly belittling, trashing periods and implying that having a penis is better. The author's response is about her personal discomfort with male genitalia, which is a valid personal opinion. The boyfriend then accuses her of sexism, which is a bit of a misdirect because the author is expressing her own preferences, not making a judgment about men in general. \n\nSexism typically involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender. Here, the author isn't making a generalization about all men or their genitalia; she's stating her own perspective. The boyfriend's reaction seems to stem from feeling criticized, perhaps because he was already making a derogatory comment about periods. His getting offended might be deflection or because he feels his masculinity is being challenged. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. She was responding to his initial comment, which was likely inappropriate. Her response is her honest opinion, and she's pointing out the discomfort she observes in male genitalia maintenance. There's no indication she's making a harmful generalization. The boyfriend's accusation of sexism doesn't hold here because the author isn't promoting discrimination; she's expressing a personal view. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's comments were problematic, and her response was a legitimate reaction to his initial remark. The boyfriend's offense is misplaced, and his accusation of sexism is incorrect in this context.\n"
