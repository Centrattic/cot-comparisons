Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after telling her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods and then said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" She responded with \"no, not really,\" explaining that male genitals seem uncomfortable and awkward. He got offended and accused her of being sexist. She's confused because he was trashing vaginas and periods earlier.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The boyfriend's initial comment was dismissive of her experience with periods and his offhand remark about wishing she had a penis could be seen as minimizing her perspective. The author is expressing her genuine discomfort with male anatomy, which is a personal opinion. She's pointing out things he does, like scratching or rearranging his genitals, which he finds normal but she finds annoying. \n\nIs it sexist to express a preference or discomfort with certain body parts? Sexism involves prejudice based on gender. The author isn't making a blanket statement about all men or women. She's talking about her own feelings towards certain anatomy. Her comments are based on her observations and personal feelings, not a generalization about gender. \n\nHer boyfriend's reaction seems to stem from feeling criticized, but she's not attacking him personally. She's stating her perspective. The fact that he was earlier making negative comments about periods and vaginas but then gets upset when she doesn't reciprocate his attitude is a bit of a double standard. \n\nThe key here is whether her statements are discriminatory. Since she's not making value judgments about the worth of either gender, just expressing her own preferences and observations, she's not being sexist. Her boyfriend's offense seems misplaced if he's treating her period negatively. The author is standing up for her own experiences and boundaries, which is valid. \n\nSo the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
