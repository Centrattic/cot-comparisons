Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person telling the story) is in the wrong in their situation.\n\nSo, the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods and joked that the author might wish they had a penis. The author responds that they don't want a penis because they find male genitalia uncomfortable and messy. The boyfriend gets offended, calls her sexist, and storms off. The author is confused because he was trashing vaginas and periods before.\n\nHmm, the boyfriend's initial comment seems dismissive of the author's experience with menstruation. Then, when she expresses her honest feelings about not wanting male anatomy, he gets upset and labels her sexist. That seems contradictory. Sexism usually involves prejudice based on gender, but here the author is making a personal preference about body types. She's not making a general statement about all women, just her own view.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction might stem from feeling criticized, but the author was just stating her perspective. He was making a joke that could be seen as trivializing her experience, and she pushed back. It's possible he felt defensive because his own anatomy was being critiqued. However, the author's comments were about her personal discomfort, not a broader judgment against men. \n\nIs there a double standard here? The boyfriend was making fun of periods and the author's body, then gets upset when she talks about his. The author's stance isn't sexist; it's about her own preferences. The boyfriend's offense might be misplaced. So, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing her honest feelings. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
