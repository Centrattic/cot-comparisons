Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for expressing her opinion that she doesn't want a penis. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods, then said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds with \"no, not really,\" explaining that male genitalia seem uncomfortable. The boyfriend gets offended, calls her sexist, and storms off.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect in a relationship. The boyfriend's initial comment was dismissive of the author's experience with periods, which is a valid and common issue. Then he makes a joke about wanting a penis, which the author finds offensive. She's stating her honest feelings about male anatomy, which isn't an attack on him but a personal preference.\n\nHe reacts with anger and accuses her of sexism, which is a bit of a deflection. His comment about trashing vaginas and periods earlier adds context; if he was making light of something she experiences, that's problematic. The author is defending her viewpoint based on her observations of his habits, like scratching or adjusting his genitalia. That's a reasonable reaction to his previous comments.\n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should feel comfortable expressing their views without fear of being attacked. The author isn't making a broad sexist statement; she's responding to his specific comment. His reaction seems more about being defensive than about her actual words. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014making a joke at her expense about her body and then getting upset when she pushes back\u2014is the issue. The answer should be B.\n"
