Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with the author's period, and then said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds that she doesn't really want a penis, giving reasons about discomfort and the maintenance involved. The boyfriend gets upset, calls her sexist, and storms off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend started by making a comment that could be seen as minimizing the author's experience with her period. Then he made a joke about her wishing to have a penis, which might be a way of trivializing her situation. The author's response is about her personal preferences regarding male anatomy, which seems like a legitimate reaction. She's expressing that she finds penises uncomfortable or inconvenient, which is a personal opinion, not necessarily an attack on him.\n\nThe boyfriend taking offense and labeling her comment as sexist might be a deflection. He was already making a joke that could be seen as dismissive of her experience. The author's response is about her own feelings about having a penis, not about making a general statement about all women or men. So, calling her sexist might not be accurate. She's not making a sweeping judgment against men but expressing her individual perspective.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's anger seems disproportionate. He was making negative comments about periods and vaginas earlier, which the author is now addressing. His reaction could be rooted in defensiveness rather than valid offense. The author is standing by her own feelings, which is reasonable. People have different preferences and comfort levels, and expressing that shouldn't be considered sexist unless it's a generalization that devalues others.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't being sexist; she's sharing her personal view. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his own defensiveness than the content of her statement. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
