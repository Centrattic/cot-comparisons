Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a conversation between the author and her boyfriend regarding gender and body parts. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods and implied the author might wish she had a penis. She responded that she doesn't want a penis because it seems uncomfortable, like having \"meat and a nut sack\" in her britches. He got offended, called her sexist, and left. She's confused because he was previously trashing vaginas and periods.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if her response was inappropriate. She's expressing her personal opinion about not wanting a male anatomy, citing discomfort. Her boyfriend felt she was sexist, but she's pointing out his earlier comments about periods were negative. So, there's a bit of back and forth here. \n\nThe key points: She's stating her preference, which is a valid personal choice. He took offense, but she's also challenging his previous remarks. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from feeling criticized, especially if he's making assumptions about his own anatomy being better. However, she's not attacking him personally, just stating her perspective. \n\nIs it sexist to not want a penis? That's a bit of a gray area. Sexism usually involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender. If she's making a generalized negative statement about male anatomy without personal context, maybe. But she's explaining her personal reasons, which are based on her observations of his behavior (like scratching). That's more about personal preference and comfort. \n\nSo, the author isn't wrong for stating her truth. Her boyfriend's reaction might be about defensiveness rather than her being in the wrong. The fact that he was previously making negative comments about her body parts complicates things. She's responding to his comment, which could be seen as a defense of her own perspective. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
