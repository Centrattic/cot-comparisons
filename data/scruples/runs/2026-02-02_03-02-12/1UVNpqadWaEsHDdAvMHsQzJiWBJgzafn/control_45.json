Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with the author's period and said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds with \"no, not really,\" explaining that male genitals seem uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend gets offended, calls her sexist, and storms off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The boyfriend made a somewhat dismissive or mocking comment about periods and then suggested that having a penis would be better. The author is pushing back against that by stating her preference not to have male genitalia, which he takes as sexism. \n\nIs the author wrong for expressing her preference? Well, people have different experiences and comfort levels with their bodies. The author is voicing her opinion based on her observations (like the boyfriend's own habits with his genitalia). If the boyfriend is making a generalization that having a penis is better because of periods, the author is challenging that. \n\nBut wait, the boyfriend says she's being sexist. Sexism typically involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender. If the author is making a negative generalization about male anatomy, is that sexist? Or is it just a personal preference? The line between personal opinion and sexism can be blurry. If she's making a broad statement about all men's genitalia being uncomfortable, maybe that's a form of sexism. However, she's talking about her own experience and observations, not making a judgment about the entire gender.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's initial comments could be seen as dismissive of women's experiences with menstruation. He's minimizing her experience by implying that having a penis is better. The author is countering that by saying she doesn't wish to have a penis, which is a valid response to his comment. \n\nSo, the boyfriend might be in the wrong for making a comment that trivializes periods, and the author is just pushing back. Her response is a personal preference, not necessarily sexist. The boyfriend's reaction of calling her sexist might be deflection or not understanding that personal preference isn't the same as prejudice. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. Her response is a legitimate expression of her feelings and observations. The boyfriend's offense might stem from not handling the criticism well or mislabeling her comments as sexist when they're just her opinion.\n"
