Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the Reddit-style question) is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis. \n\nFirst, looking at the situation: the boyfriend made a comment during her period, saying he's glad he doesn't have to deal with it and that she probably wishes she had a penis. The author responds that she doesn't, explaining that male genitalia seem uncomfortable and she doesn't want to deal with that. The boyfriend gets offended, calling her sexist, and storms off.\n\nNow, considering the boyfriend's initial comments: he was trashing periods and vaginas, which is pretty insensitive. The author is pointing out that his view is dismissive and then expressing her own perspective on why she doesn't want a penis. She's highlighting the physical discomfort and maintenance involved, which is a valid personal opinion.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is to get offended and label her as sexist. That seems like a deflection. He starts by making a negative comparison (implying having a period is worse than having a penis), and when challenged, he reacts negatively instead of engaging in a constructive conversation. \n\nThe key points here are mutual disrespect in the conversation. The boyfriend's initial remarks were dismissive and possibly hurtful. The author is responding to his comment with her own viewpoint, which is a reasonable reaction. Saying you don't want a certain body part because of discomfort isn't sexist; it's a personal preference. The boyfriend's offense seems misplaced, especially given his own initial comments.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because she's defending her perspective against his initial jab. The boyfriend's reaction is more about being defensive than the content of her response. There's a double standard here where he's criticizing her for a comment he made first. So, the answer should be B.\n"
