Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their argument with their boyfriend. The situation is that the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods and joked that the author probably wished she had a penis. She responded that she didn't want to have male genitals because they felt awkward and uncomfortable, and he got offended, calling her sexist. She's confused because he was making fun of her female anatomy and periods before.\n\nSo, first, I need to figure out if the author's response was wrong. The boyfriend's initial comment was a bit dismissive and maybe a bit sexist, joking about periods being a burden and implying that having a penis is better. The author's response was explaining her preference for not having male genitalia, which she finds uncomfortable. She's giving a personal opinion based on her observations of the boyfriend's own habits. The boyfriend then gets defensive and calls her sexist instead of reflecting on his own comments.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, I think the author is not in the wrong here. She's expressing her own body image or preference, which is valid. The boyfriend's reaction seems to stem from defensiveness and not being able to handle criticism of his own behavior. He was making light of her natural bodily functions and then got upset when she pushed back. This is a common issue where people make comments that minimize others' experiences and then get upset when those comments are challenged.\n\nThe key points are mutual disrespect, but the author was responding to the boyfriend's initial jab. She's not making a generalization about all people or making a harmful statement. She's expressing her personal view, which is her right. The boyfriend's offense seems misplaced because he initiated the conversation with his own dismissive remarks. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
