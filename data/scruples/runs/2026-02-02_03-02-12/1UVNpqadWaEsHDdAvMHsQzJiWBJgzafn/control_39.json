Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a discussion about body parts between a boyfriend and girlfriend. The boyfriend makes a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with the girlfriend's period and says she might wish she had a penis. The girlfriend responds that she doesn't want male genitalia because she finds them uncomfortable and messy, leading to an argument where the boyfriend claims she's being sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the girlfriend's response was appropriate. The boyfriend made a comment that could be seen as trivializing her experience with menstruation. By responding that she doesn't want male genitals, she's expressing her personal discomfort with those body parts. The boyfriend's reaction of being offended and calling her sexist seems like a misinterpretation of her point. She's not making a general statement about all women but sharing her personal preference based on her observations of his behavior.\n\nThe key here is whether the girlfriend's comments were sexist. Sexism involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender. Her statement is about her own preferences and physical discomfort, not a judgment against all men or their anatomy. She's pointing out specific issues she has with male genitalia, which is a personal opinion rather than a sexist remark. The boyfriend's reaction seems to stem from feeling criticized, perhaps because he felt his anatomy was being mocked, but the girlfriend was simply stating her perspective.\n\nAdditionally, the boyfriend initially made a derogatory comment about periods and vaginas, which sets a context where the conversation started with him dismissing her experience. The girlfriend's response is a direct reaction to his comment, not an attack on his gender. The boyfriend's taking offense to her literal answer (she doesn't want a penis) and labeling it as sexist is a deflection from his own initial judgment.\n\nSo, considering all that, the girlfriend isn't in the wrong. She's expressing her personal feelings, and the boyfriend's reaction is disproportionate and based on a misunderstanding. The boyfriend's initial comments were dismissive, and his reaction is more about defensiveness than a valid critique of sexism.\n"
