Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who is a woman, told her boyfriend that she doesn't want to have a penis. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with her period, and then said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responded that she doesn't want male genitals because they seem uncomfortable, like having \"meat and a nut sack\" in her pants. The boyfriend got offended and called her sexist, then got mad and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend started by making a dismissive comment about her period, which is a natural bodily function, and then made a flip comment about wishing she had a penis. The author responded honestly about her preferences regarding anatomy. Her reasons are based on observations of her boyfriend's habits, like scratching or adjusting his genital area. She's expressing her personal discomfort with male genitalia, not making a general statement about all men or all women. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction to being called sexist is confusing because he first criticized her for something (periods) that is inherent to her biology and then got upset when she expressed a different perspective on male anatomy. It seems like he might be conflating her personal preference with a broader judgment, but the author is just stating her own feelings. \n\nIs it sexist to not want a certain body part? Sexism usually involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender. The author isn't making a value judgment about gender roles or capabilities. She's talking about her personal comfort with her own body versus another anatomy. So her statement is more about personal preference than a sexist remark. \n\nThe boyfriend's initial comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with her period could be seen as trivializing her experience with menstruation. That's a gendered issue and might reflect his own biases. When he brings up the penis comment, he's perhaps trying to make a point about male experiences, but the author is responding to his comment with her own perspective. \n\nThe key here is that the author is responding to his comment with a truthful, if blunt, explanation of her feelings. She's not attacking his gender or making a claim about all women. She's simply stating her own personal view on why she doesn't want to have male genitalia. The boyfriend's taking offense as sexism doesn't align with the content of her statement. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's statement is a personal preference and a response to his initial comment. The boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate and possibly deflecting from his own initial comment about periods. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong here.\n"
