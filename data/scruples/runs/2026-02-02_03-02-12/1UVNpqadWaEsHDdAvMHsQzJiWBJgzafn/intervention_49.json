Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person writing the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told her boyfriend she doesn't want to have a penis, and he got offended, calling her sexist. The author's reasoning is that she finds male genitalia uncomfortable and annoying, pointing out things like scratching and adjusting.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods and implied the author might wish she had a penis. The author responds honestly about her feelings towards male anatomy, which leads to the boyfriend being upset.\n\nI should consider if the author's comments were respectful. She stated her personal preferences without attacking his anatomy, just expressing her view. She also points out his own habits with his genitalia, which he found upsetting. It seems like a mutual exchange of opinions, though maybe the boyfriend misinterpreted her as being sexist. The author's stance is based on personal comfort and observation, which is a valid perspective. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from feeling criticized, but the author wasn't making a judgment about his anatomy, just her own preference. \n\nIs there any element where the author overstepped? It's possible that bringing up his habits was a direct retort, but it's a valid response to his initial comment. The boyfriend's claim of sexism is a bit unclear. Sexism usually involves systemic bias or prejudice, but here it's a personal preference. The author isn't making a generalized statement against men or male anatomy; she's expressing her own feelings, which is different from sexism.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is just expressing her honest opinion in response to the boyfriend's comment. He might feel upset, but she isn't in the wrong for stating her perspective. The answer should be B.\n"
