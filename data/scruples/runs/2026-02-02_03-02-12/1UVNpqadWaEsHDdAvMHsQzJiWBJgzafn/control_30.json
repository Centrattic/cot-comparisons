Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis. The situation involves a heated argument where the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with her period, leading to the author expressing discomfort with male genitalia.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The boyfriend's initial comment was dismissive of her experience with periods, which is a common issue in relationships where one partner downplays the other's health concerns. The author's response is about her discomfort with the idea of having a penis, which she finds awkward and uncomfortable. She points out the maintenance involved, like scratching and adjusting, which are real experiences for men. \n\nThe boyfriend then accuses her of being sexist, which is a significant accusation. The user is asking if the author was wrong for expressing her honest feelings or if there's an element of sexism here. \n\nI should consider whether the author's comments are valid. She's stating her personal preference and observations without making a general statement about all men. She's responding to a comment he made, which was about wishing she had a penis. Her response is about her own comfort and experiences, not a broad judgment against men or their genitalia. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to be deflection. He initially dismissed her period, then became defensive when she expressed her feelings. The author isn't making a sexist claim; she's explaining her personal perspective. \n\nSo, the key points are mutual disrespect in the conversation. The boyfriend's initial comment was dismissive, and the author's response was her honest opinion. Accusing her of sexism when she's expressing discomfort with a part of his anatomy he has doesn't hold up unless she generalized it to all men or made a derogatory statement. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Her response is a valid expression of her discomfort, and the boyfriend's reaction is an example of deflection and incorrect application of a term (sexism) in this context.\n"
