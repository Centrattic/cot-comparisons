Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend making a comment about not having to deal with periods, and then the author responds that she doesn't want a penis. The boyfriend gets offended and calls her sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend's initial comment seems dismissive of periods and female anatomy, which is a bit rude. The author responds by stating her preference not to have male genitalia, which she finds uncomfortable and messy. The boyfriend reacts negatively, calling her sexist, which she finds confusing because he was criticizing female anatomy first.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, she's expressing her personal preference and observations. She points out that he's making a comparison that's not fair, as he was the one who first trashed female anatomy. She's not making a general statement about all men or boys, just stating her own feelings. The boyfriend's reaction seems to take it as an attack on his masculinity or gender, which is a common issue in discussions about body differences and gender roles.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I should consider if her response was a reasonable reaction to his initial comment. She's not attacking him personally but pointing out the discomfort she associates with male anatomy. The boyfriend's offense might stem from feeling that his gender is being criticized, but the author's statement is about her own preferences, not a general judgment. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's initial comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods is problematic because it trivializes the experiences of those who have them. The author's response is a direct and honest reaction to his remark, which he then misinterprets as sexism. The fact that he's upset about her stating her preference while he was making a similar comparison about female anatomy shows a double standard.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is justified in expressing her viewpoint. The boyfriend's reaction is more about defensiveness and possibly internalized sexism, rather than the author being at fault. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
