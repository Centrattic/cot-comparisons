Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's boyfriend making a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods, then joking about the author wishing they had a penis. The author responds by saying male genitals seem uncomfortable and awkward, leading the boyfriend to get offended and accuse her of being sexist. The author argues that the boyfriend was complaining about having a vagina and periods, so why is this a problem?\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend made a dismissive comment about periods and female anatomy, then the author expressed her dislike of male genitalia. The boyfriend took offense and called her sexist. The author is confused because the boyfriend was criticizing female anatomy too.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the boyfriend's initial comment seems to be making a joke that minimizes the experience of having a period, which is a valid female experience. The author's response is stating her personal preference about male anatomy, which is a natural bodily characteristic. The boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate because he's upset about her stating her preference, while he made a similar joke about her anatomy. The author's comment isn't an attack on men or male anatomy in a sexist way; it's a personal opinion. The boyfriend's offense might stem from defensiveness about his own body, but the author had a legitimate reason to push back against his earlier dismissiveness. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
