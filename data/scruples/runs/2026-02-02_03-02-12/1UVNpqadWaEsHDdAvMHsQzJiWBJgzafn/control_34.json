Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the boyfriend making a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods, and then saying something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds that she doesn't want a penis because it seems uncomfortable and messy, referencing things like scratching and rearranging. The boyfriend gets offended, calls her sexist, and storms off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend starts by commenting on the author's period in a dismissive way, implying that having a penis would be better. The author's response is based on her observations of his body maintenance\u2014like scratching or adjusting his genitalia. She's pointing out the discomfort and maintenance that comes with male genitalia, which is a valid perspective. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is to accuse her of sexism. That's a bit confusing because sexism typically involves prejudice against someone based on their sex. Here, the author is making a preference based on physical characteristics, not making a judgment about the worth of someone's sex. She isn't saying men are inferior; she's expressing a personal preference about body parts. \n\nSo, the key points are: the boyfriend made a derogatory comment about periods, then the author responds with her personal reasons for not wanting a penis. The boyfriend's offense seems misplaced. He initiated the conversation with a dismissive remark about her experience with periods, and the author is just voicing her own perspective. \n\nThe boyfriend's accusation of sexism might stem from a misunderstanding. If he thinks she's making a general statement about all men or their genitalia, rather than just a personal preference, that's a misinterpretation. The author isn't making a judgment against his gender but is explaining her own feelings about body parts. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reaction of storming off and making her think about it seems immature. He started the discussion with a negative comment, and instead of engaging in a conversation, he reacts emotionally. The author's response is a factual statement based on her observations, which is a legitimate way to express her stance.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't violating any norms here. She's responding to his comment with her honest feelings. The boyfriend, on the other hand, is dismissing her valid reasons and accusing her of something he doesn't fully understand. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
