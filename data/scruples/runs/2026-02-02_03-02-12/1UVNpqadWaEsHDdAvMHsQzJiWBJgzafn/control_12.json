Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend making a comment about not dealing with periods and implying the author wishes she had a penis. She responds by saying she doesn't want male genitalia because it seems uncomfortable, and he gets offended, calling her sexist. She's confused because he previously made negative remarks about vaginas and periods.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The boyfriend made a dismissive comment about her period and suggested she wants a penis, which could be seen as minimizing her experience. The author then expresses her discomfort with male anatomy, which the boyfriend takes as sexist. The key here is whether her statement is sexist or not. Sexism involves prejudice based on gender, often devaluing one gender. \n\nShe's expressing a personal preference, not making a judgment about all men. She's pointing out the physical aspects she finds unappealing, like discomfort or the need to constantly adjust. That's a personal opinion, not a sexist remark. The boyfriend's offense might stem from feeling his own anatomy is being criticized, but that doesn't make her statement sexist. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend previously made derogatory comments about her reproductive system, which is problematic. The author's response is a defense of her own experience and preferences. The boyfriend's reaction could be seen as deflecting his own comments and projecting. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for stating her preference. The boyfriend's behavior includes making her feel her period is a burden and then taking offense to her valid concerns. She's responding to his initial comment, and her statement isn't sexist. Therefore, the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
