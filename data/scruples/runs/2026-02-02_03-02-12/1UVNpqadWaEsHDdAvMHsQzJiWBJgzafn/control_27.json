Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a disagreement between them and their boyfriend regarding having a penis. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods and said the author might wish they had a penis. The author responded negatively, explaining they find male genitalia uncomfortable and messy, which led the boyfriend to get upset and call them sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's response was inappropriate. The boyfriend's initial comment was dismissive of the author's experience with periods, which is a valid issue. The author's response was based on their personal feelings about male anatomy, not making a generalization about all men. They gave specific reasons related to their own comfort. The boyfriend's reaction seems to stem from feeling criticized, but the author wasn't attacking his gender; they were expressing their own preferences. \n\nThe boyfriend called the author sexist, which might be a mischaracterization. Sexism involves prejudice against a particular gender, but the author was discussing their own body preferences. The boyfriend's offense might be more about ego or feeling insulted rather than a valid sexist point. The author's response was honest and specific to their experience. The boyfriend's storming off and asking to think about it seems like an overreaction. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They had a right to express their feelings, especially in response to the boyfriend's initial dismissive remarks. The boyfriend's reaction is more problematic here. So, the answer should be B.\n"
