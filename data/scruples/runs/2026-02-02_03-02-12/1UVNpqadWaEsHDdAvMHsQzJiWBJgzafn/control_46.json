Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend making a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods, then implying the woman might wish she had a penis. The woman responds that she doesn't want male genitalia because they seem uncomfortable and awkward, and the boyfriend gets offended, calling her sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the dynamics here. The boyfriend starts by making a dismissive comment about periods, then makes a flippant remark about the woman not wanting a penis. The woman's response is based on her observations of his own habits (like scratching, adjusting), which she finds irritating. The boyfriend then gets upset, calling her sexist. \n\nThe key points are: the initial comment from the boyfriend, the woman's response, and the boyfriend's reaction. The boyfriend's comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods is dismissive of the woman's experience. Then he suggests she might wish she had a penis, which could be seen as minimizing her menstrual experience. The woman's response is a legitimate reaction to his comment, pointing out the discomfort of male genitalia. \n\nThe boyfriend's offense at her response seems to stem from a deflection. He was criticizing her experience, then gets upset when she critiques his. By calling her sexist, he's trying to reframe the conversation. The woman isn't making a general statement about all men or male genitalia in a derogatory way; she's commenting on her personal observations of his specific behaviors. \n\nIs the woman in the wrong? She was responding to his initial jab. Her comments are based on her own experiences and observations. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about defensiveness than a valid point. The boyfriend's initial comments were the catalyst for the argument, so he's the one who started the conflict. Therefore, the woman isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
