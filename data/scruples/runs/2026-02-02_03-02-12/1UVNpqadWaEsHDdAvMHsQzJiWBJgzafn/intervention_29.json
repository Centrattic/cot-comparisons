Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the boyfriend making a comment about not having to deal with periods, then saying the author probably wishes she had a penis. She responds that she doesn't, explaining that male genitals seem uncomfortable. He gets offended, calls her sexist, and storms off.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The boyfriend made a flippant comment about not dealing with periods, which can be seen as dismissive or trivializing her experience. Then he makes a remark implying she might prefer being male to avoid periods. The author's response is about the physical discomfort of male genitalia, which is a personal preference. The boyfriend's reaction is to label her as sexist, which might be an overreaction. \n\nIs the author being sexist? She's expressing a personal preference based on her observations of his behavior. Sexism typically involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender. Her statement is about her own preferences, not making a broad negative generalization about men or masculinity. She's not devaluing men but pointing out what she finds uncomfortable about male anatomy.\n\nThe boyfriend's initial comment about periods could be considered dismissive, which might have contributed to the tension. He then took offense to her honest response. It's possible he felt criticized when she mentioned the \"junk\" he deals with. However, the author wasn't attacking him personally but stating her viewpoint. \n\nThe key here is whether the author crossed a line. Her response was factual and based on her perspective. The boyfriend's reaction seems to stem from being defensive. Since the author wasn't making a sexist remark but expressing a personal preference, she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his own sensitivity than her wrongdoing. So the answer should be B.\n"
