Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis. The situation involves a conversation where the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with her period, and then teased her about wishing she had a penis. She responded honestly about not wanting male genitalia because she finds them uncomfortable and messy, referencing his own habits like scratching or adjusting. He got offended, called her sexist, and left.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether her response was inappropriate. She was responding to his comment, which was a bit dismissive of her experience with periods. His initial joke might have been flippant, and her reply was a straightforward expression of her feelings. She's pointing out the physical realities of male anatomy that she finds inconvenient. Her statement isn't an attack on him personally but a statement of her preferences. \n\nHe labeled her as sexist for not wanting a penis. Sexism usually involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender. She's not making a generalization about all men or women; she's expressing a personal preference. So calling her sexist might be a mischaracterization. His reaction seems more about defensiveness than a valid point about sexism.\n\nThe boyfriend's original comments about periods being something he's glad not to deal with could be seen as trivializing her experience. Her responding by pointing out the downsides of male anatomy makes sense in the context of his comment. It's a reciprocal comparison, highlighting that both genders have their own challenges.\n\nHe took offense and left, which might indicate he's more focused on his own perceived slight than engaging in a discussion about mutual respect. The key here is whether her statement was respectful. She didn't make a personal attack but stated her views based on observation. The boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If both parties are open to discussing their perspectives without getting defensive, issues can be resolved. However, if one person reacts with anger and storms off, it's a sign of poor communication. The author was expressing her feelings in response to his comment, which he initiated. She didn't owe him a positive response to a joke that minimized her experience.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't in the wrong because she was responding to his comment, expressing her personal feelings, and not engaging in sexism. The boyfriend's reaction was defensive and he misapplied the term \"sexist.\" Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
