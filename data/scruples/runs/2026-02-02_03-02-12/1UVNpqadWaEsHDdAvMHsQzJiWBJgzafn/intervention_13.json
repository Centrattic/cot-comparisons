Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author told her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis, and he got offended, saying she was being sexist. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with her period and implied she might wish she had a penis instead. The author responded that she doesn't want male genitalia because they seem uncomfortable and awkward, referencing things like having to constantly adjust them. He got upset and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend made a comment that dismissed the difficulty of dealing with periods and suggested that having a penis would be better. The author is expressing her genuine discomfort with male anatomy, which is a personal preference. She's not attacking him as a person but stating her own perspective. \n\nThe boyfriend called her sexist, which might be because he felt the comment was a generalization or an insult towards men. But the author isn't making a statement about all men; she's talking about her own feelings towards having a penis. It's her right to express her body preferences. However, maybe the way she phrased it could be seen as a generalization, even if unintended. But in this case, she's responding to his comment, which was more dismissive of her experience.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend dismissed her period and then got upset when she rejected his implication. That seems inconsistent. If he was being dismissive of her body's natural processes, her response is a valid pushback. \n\nIs there a double standard here? He's upset about her not wanting a penis, but he made a comment that downplayed her period. It seems like he's not respecting her feelings, and she's asserting her own. So in terms of being in the wrong, the boyfriend might be the one at fault here for his initial comment. The author's response is a personal opinion, which she's entitled to express. Unless she made a sweeping negative statement about all men or penis ownership, which doesn't seem to be the case, she's not being sexist. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
