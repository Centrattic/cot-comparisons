Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to have a penis.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with her period and said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responded with \"no, not really,\" explaining that male genitalia seem uncomfortable and awkward. She gave specific reasons like dealing with \"meat and a nut sack\" and how he often scratches or rearranges his junk. The boyfriend got offended, called her sexist, and stormed off.\n\nSo, the key points here are mutual accusations. The boyfriend initially made a derogatory comment about periods and implied that having a penis would be better. The author is countering that by expressing her discomfort with male genitalia, pointing out the maintenance involved. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is to label her as sexist, which might not be the case. The author isn't making a broad statement about all men; she's expressing her personal preferences and observations. She's responding to his initial jab, so it's a form of rebuttal. \n\nThe user is asking if she's in the wrong. From what's described, she's defending her perspective after his comment. It seems like a misunderstanding or a clash in communication styles. The boyfriend's offense might stem from not wanting to hear criticism of his anatomy, but the author is just stating her opinion based on her observations. \n\nThere's also the part where he trashes vaginas and periods earlier. The author is pointing out the hypocrisy because he was comfortable criticizing her anatomy but gets upset when she does the same for his. \n\nSo, considering the context, the author isn't being sexist; she's expressing her personal discomfort. The boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate and possibly hypocritical. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
