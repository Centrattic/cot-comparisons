Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis, and he got offended, calling her sexist. She's confused because he was trashing vaginas and periods earlier.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods and implied that having a penis would be better. The author responded that she doesn't want a penis because she finds male genitalia uncomfortable and messy. He took it as sexist. \n\nIs the author being sexist? Sexism involves prejudice based on gender. She's expressing a personal preference, not making a general negative statement about men. She's pointing out the physical aspects she finds inconvenient, which is a personal opinion. Comparing it to his earlier comments about vaginas and periods, he was criticizing female biology, but she's just stating her view on male anatomy. \n\nHe's offended, but maybe he's projecting. If he made a joke about her anatomy, then she's just responding honestly. It seems like he's taking her literal statement as an attack on men, but she's just stating her personal feelings. \n\nThe key here is whether her comments were about the gender as a whole or the physical aspects. Since she's talking about the discomfort of male genitalia, it's not sexist. Also, he was making similar comments about female anatomy, so his reaction might be inconsistent. \n\nThe answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong. She's expressing personal preferences without attacking the gender, and he's overreacting.\n"
