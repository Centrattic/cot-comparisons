Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis, and he gets upset, calling her sexist.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have periods and said something about the author wishing she had a penis. She responds that she doesn't, explaining she finds male genitalia uncomfortable. He takes offense and says she's being sexist. The author points out that he was criticizing vaginas and periods earlier, but that's okay.\n\nSo, the key points here are about mutual respect and understanding each other's perspectives. The boyfriend's initial comment seems dismissive of her experience with menstruation, which is a valid and common experience. The author is expressing her genuine feelings about male anatomy, which leads to the boyfriend feeling targeted. However, his reaction might be rooted in feeling criticized, perhaps without realizing that the author is just sharing her honest opinion.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? She's responding to his comment with her own perspective, which is a natural part of communication. Her statement is based on her observations and feelings, not a personal attack. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from defensiveness rather than understanding her viewpoint. He was also making a comparison that could be seen as minimizing her experience, which could contribute to the conflict.\n\nThe boyfriend's callout of sexism here seems misplaced. The author isn't making a broad statement against all men or male anatomy in a discriminatory way; she's expressing her personal preference and observations. It's possible he felt his identity or body was under attack, but that doesn't make her comment wrong. The author isn't in the wrong for stating her feelings, especially in response to his initial remark. The boyfriend's storming off and labeling her as sexist might be an overreaction, given the context of his earlier comments about periods and vaginas.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because she's sharing her honest perspective, which is her right. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his own defensiveness than her being incorrect. So the answer should be B.\n"
