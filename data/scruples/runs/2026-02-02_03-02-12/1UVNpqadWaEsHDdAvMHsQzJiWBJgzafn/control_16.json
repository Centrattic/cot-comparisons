Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author told her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis, and he got upset, calling her sexist. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with the author's period and said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responded with \"no, not really,\" and then explained that she finds male genitals uncomfortable and inconvenient, like the idea of having to scratch or adjust them all the time. He got offended, called her sexist, and stormed off.\n\nHmm. The author is pointing out that her boyfriend was making a comparison that's dismissive of female biology (periods), so she's pushing back against that. Her reasons for not wanting a penis are based on her observations of the boyfriend's own behavior, like scratching or adjusting his genitals. She's making a personal preference point, but he took it as sexist. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, the boyfriend initiated the conversation by making a negative comparison between his experience (not having periods) and hers. He then asked her why she wouldn't want a penis, which seems to be a way of undermining her experience. The author is stating her honest opinion based on her observations. If he's calling her sexist for expressing her view, that might be a case of him deflecting his own sexist comment. \n\nSexism usually involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender. The boyfriend's initial comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods is sexist because it's trivializing a female experience. The author's response is pointing out the discomfort of male anatomy, which is a valid personal perspective. She's not making a generalized negative statement about all men, but rather about the physical aspects of having a penis based on her observations. \n\nSo, the boyfriend's reaction seems out of proportion. He started with a sexist remark, and then when she challenges him, he accuses her of sexism. That looks like a case of him being defensive and not taking responsibility for his initial comment. The author is just expressing her preferences, and it's a discussion about bodily differences. Unless her statement is a generalization that's derogatory towards men, which it doesn't seem to be, she's not being sexist. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Her response is a legitimate reaction to his initial sexist comment. The boyfriend's offense is misplaced and possibly an attempt to shift blame.\n"
