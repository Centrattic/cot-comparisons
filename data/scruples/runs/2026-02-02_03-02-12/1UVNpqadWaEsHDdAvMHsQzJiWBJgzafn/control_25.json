  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I don't want a penis?\nThis whole argument is really weird to me. Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend and girlfriend discussing the topic of male versus female anatomy and periods.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend makes a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods and says, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds with \"no, not really,\" and then explains that male genitals seem uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend gets offended and calls her sexist. The author then points out that he was trashing vaginas and periods before, which seems hypocritical.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about mutual respect in a relationship. The boyfriend made a dismissive comment about periods, which is a sensitive topic. The author's response is a personal opinion about not wanting male genitalia. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be about being offended by her opinion, which might be a case of him not handling criticism well, especially since he was the one who started the conversation with his own negative comments.\n\nThe author isn't making a generalization about all men or all women, just sharing her personal feelings. The boyfriend's argument that this is sexist might not hold because she's not making a sweeping statement but expressing her own perspective. The fact that he was upset about her opinion but didn't seem to mind his own negative remarks about her experience (periods) shows a lack of consistency and maturity in handling the discussion.\n\nSo, the author's response is a valid expression of her feelings, and the boyfriend's reaction is disproportionate, especially given his initial comments. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
