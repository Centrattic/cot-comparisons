Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling her boyfriend that she doesn't want a penis, and he got upset, calling her sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods, and then said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds that she doesn't, explaining that male genitalia seem uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend takes offense, saying she's being sexist. \n\nSo, the author is defending her opinion about not wanting a penis, which he perceives as sexist. But is it sexist to have preferences about anatomy? Sexism usually involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender. If she's just stating her personal preference without making a generalization about all men or women, maybe it's not sexist. She's talking about her own body and what she finds uncomfortable. \n\nThe boyfriend was making a joke or a comment about periods, which might not be respectful either. He was trashing vaginas and periods, but she's being called sexist for her opinion. The author might be pointing out that his comments were dismissive of her experience, and she's standing her ground about her own body. \n\nIs she wrong for expressing her opinion? If the boyfriend is being defensive and calling her sexist for stating her preferences, he might be the one in the wrong. But maybe the issue is how she framed her argument. If she was mocking his anatomy or making generalizations about men, that could be a problem. But from the description, she's just explaining her own feelings about having a penis, based on observing his habits. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's comments were a personal preference versus a discriminatory statement. Since she's talking about her own preferences and not making derogatory statements about men as a gender, she's probably in the right. The boyfriend's reaction seems hypersensitive, especially since he was the one who brought up the topic in a potentially dismissive way. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's expressing her personal opinion about her body, and the boyfriend's offense might be misplaced. The situation also highlights potential double standards where his comments about periods are dismissed while her similar but anatomical comments are labeled as sexist.\n"
