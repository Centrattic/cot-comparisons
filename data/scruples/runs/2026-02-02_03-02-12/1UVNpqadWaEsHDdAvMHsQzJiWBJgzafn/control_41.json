Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis. The situation starts with the boyfriend making a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with her period and implying she might wish she had a penis. The author responds that she doesn't and explains why, finding male genitalia uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend gets offended, calls her sexist, and storms off. She's confused because he previously criticized female biology.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if her response is justified. The boyfriend made a flip comment, and she's responding to his assertion that she might wish for a penis. Her reasons are based on observing his behavior\u2014like scratching and adjusting\u2014and finding those aspects annoying. She's being honest about her preferences. \n\nIs there any sexism in her view? The boyfriend accuses her of being sexist. But his own comments were dismissive towards periods and vaginas. The author isn't making a blanket statement about all men or women; she's stating her personal discomfort with male genitalia. Personal preferences about body autonomy and comfort don't necessarily equate to sexism. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate. He's upset about her preference, while he was okay with his own negative comments. That inconsistency is a key point. The author isn't wrong for expressing her honest feelings, especially when his initial remarks were trivializing her experience. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's responding to his comment and sharing her perspective. The boyfriend's offense is misplaced, given his own earlier remarks.\n"
