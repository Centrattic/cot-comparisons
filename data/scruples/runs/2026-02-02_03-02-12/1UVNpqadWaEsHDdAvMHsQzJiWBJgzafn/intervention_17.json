Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after telling her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis. The situation started with the boyfriend making a comment about not having to deal with periods, implying he's glad he's male. The author then says she doesn't want a penis, explaining it's uncomfortable, and he gets offended, calling her sexist. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the conversation. The boyfriend was making a dismissive or possibly sexist comment about periods, and the author is responding by highlighting the physical discomfort of male genitalia. She's pointing out that having a penis comes with its own issues, which he might not acknowledge. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to stem from feeling criticized or insulted. He might perceive her comments as attacking his body or masculinity, hence calling her sexist. But the author is just stating her personal preference and observations. When he says she's being sexist, that could be a deflection from his own earlier sexist remarks.\n\nI should also think about consent and boundaries in relationships. The author is expressing her honest feelings, which is valid. She's not forcing her opinion on him but clarifying her own stance. His reaction of storming off and making her \"think\" about it might indicate he's not handling the conversation constructively.\n\nAnother angle is the term \"sexist.\" The author isn't making a generalization against all men; she's expressing a personal preference. Unless her statement is a broad, harmful stereotype, she's within her rights to share her perspective. However, the boyfriend might misinterpret her words as sexist because he's sensitive about his own anatomy.\n\nBut wait, is there a nuance I'm missing? For example, if the author's comment could be seen as a generalization about all men's bodies, but she's actually just stating her own view. The key here is whether her statement is a personal preference versus a judgment about men as a whole. Since she's talking about her own feelings, not making a broader claim, it's probably not sexist.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's initial comment was probably more problematic. He was making a joke about not having to deal with periods, which could be seen as dismissing the challenges women face. The author's response is bringing up the challenges of male anatomy, which balances the conversation a bit. \n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, both need to communicate respectfully. The author isn't wrong for expressing her discomfort with male genitalia. She's also not wrong for pointing out that he's making a comparison that might be unfair. His reaction suggests he's not open to discussing this, which is a problem for him to address.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's responding to his initial comment with her own perspective, and his reaction seems more about defensiveness than her being at fault. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
