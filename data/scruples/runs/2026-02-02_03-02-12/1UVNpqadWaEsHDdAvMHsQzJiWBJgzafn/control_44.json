Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple arguing over the boyfriend's comment about not having to deal with periods and the woman responding that she doesn't want a penis.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The boyfriend made a casual comment being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods and implied that she might wish she had a penis. She responded that she doesn't want a penis because male genitalia seem uncomfortable and messy. He took offense, called her sexist, and got angry. The woman is confused because he was making fun of vaginas and periods earlier but now he's upset.\n\nThe key points here are consent, respect, and the nature of their communication. The woman is expressing her personal preference and physical discomfort regarding male genitalia. She's not making a generalization about all men or all women, but stating her own feelings. The boyfriend's initial comment was dismissive of her experience with periods, which can be seen as invalidating. His reaction to her response as \"sexist\" seems hypocritical because he was criticizing her experience first.\n\nIs she in the wrong? The question is whether her response was inappropriate. Expressing personal preferences about one's own body is a right. If the boyfriend was open to discussing topics about her period, then he should be open to her discussing her views on male anatomy. The issue might be his reaction being overly sensitive or hypocritical rather than her statement being wrong. She's not making a derogatory statement about men, just sharing her perspective based on observation. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
