Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple discussing their genitals and preferences. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods, and remarked that the author probably wishes she had a penis. She responds that she doesn't, explaining that male genitalia seem uncomfortable to her. The boyfriend gets offended and calls her sexist. The author is confused because he was criticizing vaginas and periods, but that's supposedly okay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend's initial comment was dismissive of her experience with menstruation, which can be a sensitive topic. His remark about her wishing to have a penis might be seen as undermining her feelings about her own body. The author's response is about her personal preference and comfort with her anatomy, which is a valid point. She's expressing her perspective without imposing it on him. \n\nThen, the boyfriend gets upset and calls her sexist. That's interesting because he was the one making a comment that could be seen as devaluing her experience. The author is pointing out the discomfort she observes in his anatomy, which is a personal opinion. It's not necessarily sexist to express discomfort with male genitalia, as it's about personal experience and observations. \n\nThe key here is whether the author overstepped. She was responding to his comment, which was the initial provocation. She's stating her own preferences and observations, which are subjective. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be about feeling criticized, but she wasn't making a generalization about all people with male genitalia; it's about her own feelings. So, unless she made a sweeping statement that could be considered sexist, she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend's offense might stem from feeling that his body is being criticized, but it's a mutual conversation where he started by criticizing hers. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's comparison\u2014trashing vaginas and periods but then taking offense to her comments\u2014seems contradictory. The author is pointing out the inconsistency. So overall, the author's response is a legitimate reaction to his initial remark. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
