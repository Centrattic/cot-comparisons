Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after telling her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with her period and said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" She responds that she doesn't, explaining that male genitals seem uncomfortable and she doesn't want the \"meat and nut sack\" in her britches. He gets offended, calls her sexist, and storms off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their conversation. The boyfriend made a flippant comment about her period, which can be a sensitive topic. His remark about her wishing to have a penis seems like he's dismissing the challenges she faces with her body. The author then explains her reasons for not wanting a penis, focusing on the physical discomfort and maintenance she observes in him, like scratching or adjusting. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is to be offended and label her as sexist. But what is sexism in this context? Sexism typically involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender. The author is expressing a personal preference and her observations about the physical aspects of male genitalia. She's not making a judgment about men or women; she's stating her own feelings. \n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The boyfriend's initial comment trivializes her experience with periods, which is a real and common issue. The author's response is a direct reaction to his comment. She's highlighting the discomfort she associates with male genitalia, which is a personal opinion. But does that count as sexist? If she were to generalize that all women feel the same way or make a derogatory statement about men, that could be sexist. Here, though, she's speaking for herself and her observations.\n\nAnother angle is the power of the word \"sexist.\" If he's using it to shut down the conversation, that might be problematic. It's possible he's deflecting his own insensitivity by accusing her of sexism. His reaction seems more about being defensive than addressing the actual issue of dismissing her period-related struggles.\n\nThe key points are: \n1. The boyfriend made a dismissive comment about her period and implied she might want to switch genders.\n2. She honestly expressed her discomfort with male genitalia.\n3. He took offense and labeled her sexist, leading to an argument.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because she's responding to his initial comment and expressing her genuine feelings. The boyfriend's reaction is more about ego and defensiveness than valid sexism. However, there's a need for mutual respect in discussions about body differences. The boyfriend shouldn't have made a flippant comment about periods in the first place, and the author's response is a legitimate reaction. So, the answer is B.\n"
