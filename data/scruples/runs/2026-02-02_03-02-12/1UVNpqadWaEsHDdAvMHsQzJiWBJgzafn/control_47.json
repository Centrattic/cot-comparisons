Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The main points are that the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with the author's period and said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds that she doesn't want a penis because it seems uncomfortable and awkward, and the boyfriend got offended and called her sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend made a dismissive comment about periods and then made a sarcastic remark implying that having a penis would be better. The author's response is her honest opinion about not wanting male genitalia. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be defensiveness and taking offense, even calling her sexist. The author is confused because he was trashing vaginas and periods earlier.\n\nI should evaluate if the author was wrong to express her feelings. She's stating her preferences and reasons, which are personal. The boyfriend's comment was probably intended to be a joke or a jab, but the author's response was a legitimate expression of her discomfort. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be about ego or feeling attacked, maybe projecting his own sexism. The fact that he was trashing vaginas before adds context that he might be in the wrong for making the initial comments.\n\nIs it sexist to prefer not having male genitalia? Probably not. Sexism is about prejudice against a gender. She's not denigrating men but stating her personal preference based on her observations. The boyfriend's claim of being sexist is likely a mischaracterization. The author isn't making a value judgment about men but about the physical attributes. So, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing her views. The boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate and possibly sexist himself for trivializing her experience.\n"
