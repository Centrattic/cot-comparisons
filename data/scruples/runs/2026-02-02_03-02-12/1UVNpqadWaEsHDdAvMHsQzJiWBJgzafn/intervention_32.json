Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis, and he got offended, calling her sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with her period and said she might wish she had a penis. The author responds that she doesn't, explaining that male genitalia seem uncomfortable. The boyfriend gets upset, says she's sexist, and leaves. The author is confused because he was making negative comments about vaginas and periods earlier.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong to express her discomfort with having a penis. The boyfriend's reaction is that he's offended and she's being sexist. But the author is pointing out that he was already being dismissive of female biology. \n\nI need to consider free speech and personal preferences. The author is stating her opinion, which is a personal preference. The boyfriend's comment was probably a backhanded compliment or a way to minimize the challenges of being a woman. The author's response was honest, pointing out the physical discomforts she observes in his anatomy. \n\nThe boyfriend's offense might stem from feeling that his body is being criticized, but the author isn't attacking him; she's expressing her own viewpoint. Also, the boyfriend's initial comments about periods and vaginas could be seen as contributing to the tension. \n\nFrom a feminist/sex-positive perspective, the author is valid in her feelings. People can have preferences about their anatomy, and it's not inherently sexist to find another gender's body parts inconvenient. However, if she were making generalizations about all men or dismissing his experiences, that could be different. But here, she's explaining her own perspective based on observation. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of calling her sexist seems misplaced. Sexism involves prejudice based on gender, but the author isn't making a value judgment about gender; she's talking about physical preferences. His getting upset might be more about ego or feeling criticized rather than genuine sexism.\n\nAlso, the fact that the boyfriend was trashing vaginas and periods before she responded shows that he made the first offensive move. The author's response is a direct reaction to his comment, so it's reasonable for her to express her view.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's responding to his comment with her honest feelings, and his reaction is disproportionate and possibly hypocritical given his earlier remarks. The answer should be B (No).\n"
