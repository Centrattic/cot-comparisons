Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for saying they don't want a penis. The situation is that the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods, then asked if she wished she had a penis. She responded negatively, explaining that male genitalia seem uncomfortable and awkward. He called her sexist and got upset.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's initial comment about periods being a problem he's glad to avoid is dismissive of her experience. Then he brings up the penis comment, which could be seen as trivializing her perspective. The author's response is based on her observations of his grooming habits, which she finds annoying. She's expressing her personal preference, not making a generalization about all men or their bodies. \n\nHe labels her sexist, but sexism involves prejudice against someone based on their sex. Here, she's not making a judgment about his worth because he's male. She's discussing her own comfort with her body versus his. His reaction seems defensive and possibly projecting his own sexist remarks onto her. The key point is whether her statement is sexist. Since she's stating her personal opinion without attacking his identity, she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction is misplaced, especially since he was the one making derogatory remarks first. So the answer should be B.\n"
