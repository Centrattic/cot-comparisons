Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with the author's period and said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds that they don't want a penis because it sounds uncomfortable and awkward, mentioning things like having to deal with genital maintenance. The boyfriend gets upset, calls her sexist, and storms off.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is wrong for expressing her opinion. The boyfriend made a derogatory comment about periods and then questioned her desire to have a penis. The author is pointing out the potential downsides of male genitalia, which seems like a reasonable response. She's not making a personal attack but stating her perspective. The boyfriend's reaction seems to stem from defensiveness. He might feel that her comments are sexist against men, but she's just expressing her own preferences. \n\nThe key here is whether expressing a personal preference or observation is sexist. The author isn't making a broad statement about all men but is commenting on the anatomy she doesn't want. The boyfriend's initial comments about trashing vaginas and periods seem more problematic. The author is responding to his comment, so her reaction seems justified. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong because she's expressing her honest feelings in response to his initial dismissive remarks. The boyfriend's reaction is overblown and possibly projecting his own issues onto her.\n"
