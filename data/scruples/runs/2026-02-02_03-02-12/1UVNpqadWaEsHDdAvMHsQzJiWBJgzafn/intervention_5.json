Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to have a penis. The situation involves her boyfriend making a comment about her period and then asking why she wouldn't want a penis. She responds by finding male genitalia uncomfortable and messy, and he gets upset, calling her sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend starts by making a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with her period and says something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" That seems a bit dismissive or maybe even slightly condescending, implying that having a period is a burden he's happy to avoid, and then suggesting she might prefer being a man. His statement could be seen as trivializing her experience with menstruation.\n\nThe author responds with \"no, not really,\" which is a straightforward answer to his question. When he presses for reasons, she gives her honest opinion about the discomfort and maintenance of male genitalia. She points out his own habits, like scratching or adjusting, which she finds annoying. He then gets offended and calls her sexist. \n\nNow, the key here is whether her statement is sexist. Sexism typically involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender. The author is making a personal preference based on her observations. She's not making a broad negative statement about all men or all males. Instead, she's expressing her own view that male genitalia are uncomfortable. Comparing this to his earlier comments about periods being a burden, it's a bit of a double standard. He was making a negative comment about her natural body function, and she's responding with her own perspective on his anatomy.\n\nHe seems to take her statement as an attack on his gender, but she's not denigrating men in general; she's just stating her preference. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from feeling that her comment is a criticism of his body or gender, but that's his interpretation. The author is just being honest about her own feelings. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's initial comment about periods and implying she might wish to be a man could be seen as undermining her experience. His getting upset when she doesn't share his implied assumption (that being male is better in that context) might indicate that he's more invested in his own viewpoint than in a genuine discussion. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's responding truthfully to his question without malice or sexist intent. The boyfriend's reaction is disproportionate, especially since he initiated the conversation with his own potentially sexist remark. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
