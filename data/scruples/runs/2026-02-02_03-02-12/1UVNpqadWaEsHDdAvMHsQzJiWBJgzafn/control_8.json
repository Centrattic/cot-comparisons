Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is the author told their boyfriend that they don't want to have a penis. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods and said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds that they don't want male genitals because they find them uncomfortable and awkward, referencing things like scratching and rearranging. The boyfriend then gets offended, calls her sexist, and storms off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend made a derogatory comment about periods, which are a natural part of the female body, and then made a joke about the author wanting a penis. The author is responding to his comment, pointing out the discomfort of male genitalia. The boyfriend then accuses her of being sexist for not wanting a penis. \n\nIs the author being sexist for not wanting male genitalia? Sexism typically involves prejudice based on gender. If the author is making a negative judgment about a gender based on stereotypes, that could be sexist. However, in this case, the author is expressing a personal preference, not making a judgment about the entire gender. She's talking about her own physical preferences, not about the worth or capabilities of men as a group. \n\nThe boyfriend made a derogatory comment about periods, which is a sensitive topic. The author is pushing back against his comment. The boyfriend then shifts the focus to her being sexist for not wanting male genitalia. This seems like a deflection. The author is responding to his joke with her genuine feelings about the physical aspects of male anatomy, not making a generalization about all men. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reaction seems to be more about being defensive about his own body rather than addressing the initial issue about periods. The author's comment isn't a generalization but a personal choice. So, the boyfriend's accusation of sexism doesn't hold here because the author isn't making a broad statement about all men. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. She's expressing her perspective in response to his comment. The boyfriend's reaction is inappropriate because he's not addressing the initial issue and is taking offense where it's not warranted. The answer should be B.\n"
