Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend and girlfriend having an argument over whether the girlfriend would want to have a penis instead of her own genitalia.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The boyfriend makes a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods and implies the girlfriend might wish she had a penis. She responds that she doesn't, explaining that male genitalia seem uncomfortable and awkward. He gets offended, calls her sexist, and storms off. She's confused because he was criticizing vaginas and periods earlier.\n\nSo, the key points here are: \n\n1. The boyfriend's initial comment was dismissive of her experience with periods and implied that having a penis would be better. That could be seen as minimizing her experience.\n2. The author (girlfriend) is stating her honest opinion that male genitalia are uncomfortable, which he interprets as sexist. But she's pointing out that he has to deal with things like adjusting and scratching, which she finds annoying.\n3. He gets upset and leaves, while she's pointing out hypocrisy because he was criticizing female anatomy earlier.\n\nI need to consider if her statement was offensive or sexist. She's expressing a personal preference based on her observations. She's not making a generalization about all men or women, just stating that she wouldn't want to have male genitalia. However, he might see this as a sexist remark because it could imply that female anatomy is superior or that male anatomy is inferior.\n\nBut wait, she's responding to his comment that she might wish she had a penis. She's saying she doesn't, which is a direct answer. His offense might come from feeling that her comment is making male genitalia seem less desirable, which he perceives as sexist. However, he was the one who started the conversation by criticizing her experience with periods. \n\nIn terms of sexism, if someone criticizes another gender's biology without understanding their experience, that can be problematic. But in this case, she's not making a value judgment on the gender itself, just her own preference. She's pointing out the discomfort she observes in his experience, which could be a valid point. \n\nThe boyfriend might be conflating her opinion about anatomy with sexism, which isn't necessarily correct. His reaction could be more about defensiveness than actual sexism. Also, his initial comments about periods being a problem he doesn't have to deal with are themselves potentially dismissive of her experience. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. She's responding honestly to his comment, and his reaction seems hypersensitive, especially given his own previous remarks. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
