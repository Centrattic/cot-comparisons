Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after telling her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis. The situation involves a heated argument where the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with her period, then joked about her wishing she had a penis. She responds that she doesn't want male genitals because they seem uncomfortable. He gets offended and calls her sexist. She's confused because he was making negative comments about vaginas and periods earlier.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if her response was inappropriate. She's expressing her personal discomfort with male anatomy, which is her right. The boyfriend's initial comment was dismissive and potentially sexist, as he's minimizing her experience with menstruation. Her reaction seems like a legitimate response to his comment. He then takes offense, which might be because he feels criticized. However, making a joke about someone's body can be seen as disrespectful. The key here is whether her statement was sexist or just a personal opinion. She's not making a generalization about all women, just stating her own feelings. \n\nThe boyfriend's offense might stem from feeling attacked, but he started the conversation with a derogatory remark. The author's response is a direct reaction to his comment. It's important to note that expressing personal preferences about body parts isn't inherently sexist. The boyfriend's reaction could be defensiveness rather than a valid point. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong because she's asserting her own perspective in response to his comment. The boyfriend's behavior includes making disparaging remarks first, which sets the tone. The author's response is a form of pushing back against his sexist comment. Therefore, she's not the one at fault here.\n"
