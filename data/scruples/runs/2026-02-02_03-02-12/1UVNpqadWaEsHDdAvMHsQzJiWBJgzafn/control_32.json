Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is the author told her boyfriend that she doesn't want a penis. The boyfriend was making a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods, and he said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds that she doesn't want a penis because it seems uncomfortable and awkward to have all that anatomy. He gets offended and calls her sexist, then storms off.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The boyfriend was making a derogatory comment about periods and implying that having a vagina is a downside. The author is responding to his comment by explaining her discomfort with male anatomy. The key here is whether her response was sexist or not.\n\nThe boyfriend's initial comment seems to be devaluing female experiences (periods) and suggesting that having a penis is better. The author is pushing back against that by stating her preference for female anatomy, which could be seen as a counter to his sexist remarks. She's pointing out the discomforts of male genitalia, which he seems to take as an attack on his gender.\n\nBut wait, is it sexist to point out the downsides of a body part associated with another gender? The boyfriend accused her of being sexist, but she's just expressing her personal feelings. Sexism involves prejudice or stereotyping based on gender. If she's making a generalization that all men would find their anatomy uncomfortable, that could be problematic. However, she's talking about her personal perspective\u2014she doesn't want a penis because she observes her boyfriend dealing with it. That seems more like a personal opinion rather than a systemic sexist belief.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems out of proportion. He was trashing periods and then gets upset when the author points out the downsides of his anatomy. This could be an example of him not being able to handle criticism of his gender when he was already criticizing hers. The author is responding to his initial comment, which was likely the more problematic part.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the boyfriend was making sexist remarks, the author's response is a valid reaction. She's not being sexist because she's not devaluing all men or making harmful generalizations. She's expressing personal discomfort and pointing out the flip side of his argument. The boyfriend's offense might stem from defensiveness because he was already being critical of her gender. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
