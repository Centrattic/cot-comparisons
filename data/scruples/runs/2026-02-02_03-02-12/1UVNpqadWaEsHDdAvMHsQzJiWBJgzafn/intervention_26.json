Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a conversation between the author and her boyfriend about not wanting to have a penis. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with the author's period, and then said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds that she doesn't, finding male genitalia uncomfortable and awkward, and mentions things like scratching and rearranging. The boyfriend gets offended, calls her sexist, and storms off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the conversation. The boyfriend initially made a dismissive or devaluing comment about the author's experience with her period, which is a common issue many women face. Then he flips the script by suggesting that maybe she wishes she had a penis. The author's response is based on her personal discomfort with male genitalia, pointing out the practical aspects like needing to constantly attend to them. \n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and the tone of the conversation. The boyfriend started by making a statement that could be seen as trivializing her experience with menstruation. Then, when the author expresses her own valid feelings about male anatomy, he takes offense and labels her as sexist. That seems a bit hypocritical, especially since he initiated the discussion with a comment that could be considered disrespectful.\n\nThe author is expressing her genuine feelings without being aggressive. She's not attacking him personally but stating her preferences. The boyfriend's response of calling her sexist and storming off might be an overreaction. He could have engaged in a discussion about why her comments upset him instead of ending the conversation. \n\nAlso, the fact that he was trashing vaginas and periods earlier complicates things. If he was criticizing her anatomy, then his offense at her critiquing his anatomy seems inconsistent. Both should be able to express their feelings without being labeled negatively. The author's stance is about her body and her comfort, which is a valid perspective.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, unless the author made a personal attack or used derogatory language, she's within her rights to express her opinion. The boyfriend's reaction seems to stem from defensiveness rather than a constructive dialogue. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong here.\n"
