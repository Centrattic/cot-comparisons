Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis, and he got offended, calling her sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to break down what happened. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with her period and said she might wish she had a penis. She responded that she didn't, explaining that male genitalia seem uncomfortable and messy. He got upset, called her sexist, and left. The author is confused because he was making negative comments about vaginas and periods before she even responded.\n\nSo, the key points here are mutual disrespect and the context of the argument. The boyfriend started with a comment that's dismissive of her experience with periods, implying that having a penis would be better. The author then expresses her own discomfort with male anatomy, which he takes as sexist. The question is whether her response was inappropriate.\n\nIn terms of sexism, sexism usually involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender. The author is making a personal preference based on her observations and comfort, not necessarily making a broad negative statement about men. She points out the physical aspects she finds unpleasant, which is a personal opinion. However, the boyfriend's initial comments were also problematic because they trivialized her experience with periods, which is a common issue women face. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to be deflection. He's upset about being criticized for his own comments when he first made a negative remark about her body. The author is just stating her perspective in response to his. The fact that he called her sexist after making a sexist comment himself is hypocritical. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Both parties made comments that could be seen as disrespectful. The author's response was a direct and honest reaction to his initial remark. She's not wrong for expressing her discomfort with male genitalia; that's a personal opinion. However, the way she presented it might come off as dismissive of his experiences, but given the context, she was responding to his first jab.\n\nSo, considering the sequence of events, the boyfriend initiated the problematic comment. The author's response was in direct reply. Neither is entirely without fault, but the question is about the author specifically. Since she was reacting to his initial remark and expressing her own feelings without attacking his gender as a whole, she's not necessarily in the wrong. The boyfriend's offense seems misplaced and hypocritical given his own comments. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
