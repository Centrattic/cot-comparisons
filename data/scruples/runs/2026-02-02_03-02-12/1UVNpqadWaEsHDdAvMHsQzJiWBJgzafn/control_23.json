Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis. The situation involves a conversation where the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with her period, and then joked about her wishing she had a dick. She responds by saying she doesn't want male genitalia, explaining she finds it uncomfortable. He gets offended, calls her sexist, and storms off.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if her response was inappropriate. The boyfriend made a flippant comment that could be seen as dismissive of her experience with menstruation. His joke about her wishing for a penis might be a way to minimize the hassle of periods. The author's response is a direct and honest reaction to that joke, pointing out the discomfort she observes in him. She's making a valid observation about the maintenance of male genitalia, which could be seen as a fair counterpoint to his earlier dismissal of her period. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of being offended and calling her sexist seems a bit off. If he's making a joke that's meant to trivialize her period, then her pushing back against that by pointing out the downsides of male anatomy isn't necessarily sexist. Sexism would involve prejudice or bias based on gender, but she's making a personal choice based on her observations. She's not making a generalization about all women or all men. \n\nHe then gets upset and storms off, asking her to think about why she was wrong. The fact that he was trashing vaginas and periods earlier (as the author mentions) suggests he was already being dismissive. So his getting upset about her response might be more about his own defensiveness than her being sexist. \n\nThe key here is whether her statement was a reasonable response. Since she's stating her personal preference and her observed experiences, it's a valid point. She's not attacking his gender but expressing her own feelings. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction is more problematic because he was the one making the initial dismissive and sexist remark. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
