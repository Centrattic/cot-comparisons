Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a boyfriend and girlfriend discussing gender-related preferences.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend makes a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods and says the girlfriend probably wishes she had a penis. She responds that she doesn't and explains why, leading to him getting offended and calling her sexist. \n\nI need to assess if the author (the girlfriend) is wrong. The key points here are about mutual respect in communication. The boyfriend's initial comment was dismissive of the girlfriend's experience with periods and then made a joke about gender. She responded honestly about her feelings towards male anatomy, which he took as sexism. \n\nIs her response sexist? She's expressing a personal preference and observation based on her experiences of observing his habits. She's not making a broad, generalized statement about all men or their genitalia. Her comments are specific to her own preference and observations. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to stem from defensiveness. He first trashes her perspective and then gets upset when she counters his point. The user is pointing out inconsistency in his reaction. \n\nSo, the author isn't being sexist; she's asserting her own feelings in response to his. The boyfriend's offense seems misplaced, especially since he started the conversation with a derogatory remark. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
