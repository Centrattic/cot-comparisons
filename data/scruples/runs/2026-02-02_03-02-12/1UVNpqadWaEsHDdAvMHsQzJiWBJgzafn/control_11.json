Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author told her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis, and he got offended, calling her sexist. She argues that he was trashing vaginas and periods earlier.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with her period and said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds that she doesn't, explaining that male genitals seem uncomfortable and messy. He gets offended and calls her sexist. She counters by pointing out his own habits with his genital area.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author's response was sexist. The boyfriend made a derogatory comment about her body (periods, vaginas), and she's pointing out the other side\u2014male genitalia's potential discomfort. Is that sexist? Or is she just pointing out the flip side of his earlier sexism?\n\nIn the context of the conversation, the boyfriend was already making negative comments about female anatomy. The author's response seems to be a direct reaction to his jab. She's expressing her own discomfort with male anatomy, which he found offensive. But his initial comments were dismissive of her experience with periods, which is a common form of sexism. Her response might be seen as highlighting the double standard\u2014she's not being sexist if she's responding to his sexist remarks by pointing out the other side. However, some might argue that making negative generalizations about male anatomy could also be sexist, but given the context, her response seems like a justified pushback against his previous comments.\n\nThe boyfriend getting offended and calling her sexist might be an overreaction. The key is whether her statement was a personal opinion based on her observations (like him scratching or adjusting his genitals) versus making a broad, sexist generalization. Since she's using his own behavior as an example, it's more of a personal critique rather than a sexist remark. Also, she's not making a value judgment beyond her own preference, just stating her discomfort with male anatomy based on what she observes.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Her response is a legitimate reaction to his sexist comment. The boyfriend's offense might stem from feeling criticized about his own body, but he initiated the argument with his derogatory remarks about her body. So the answer should be B.\n"
