Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong after stating she doesn't want a penis. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with her period and said something like, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds with \"no, not really,\" explaining that male genitals seem uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend gets offended and calls her sexist. She argues by pointing out he scratches his nuts and rearranges his junk, which she finds annoying. He storms off upset.\n\nSo, first, the boyfriend made a casual, possibly flippant comment about periods and male anatomy. The author's response was a straightforward expression of her personal discomfort with male genitalia. She's not attacking him as a person but stating her own preferences. The boyfriend's reaction seems to stem from feeling personally attacked, even though the author was expressing her opinion, not making a judgment about his anatomy. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he initiated the conversation by making a comment that could be seen as trivializing her experience with periods. Her response was a direct answer to his question, not an aggressive statement. She's explaining her reasoning, which is based on her observations of his behavior. He called her sexist, which might be a mischaracterization of her argument. She's not making a general statement about all men or all penises, but rather her own desire not to have that anatomy. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Both parties might have overreacted. The boyfriend's comment could be seen as dismissive of her experience with menstruation, which is a sensitive topic. The author's response, while direct, is a valid expression of her feelings. There's no inherent wrong in stating one's own preferences, especially when provoked. The boyfriend's reaction could be due to defensiveness or not wanting to hear a critique of male anatomy, even if it's not directed at him personally. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. She was responding to his comment and explaining her perspective. The boyfriend's offense seems misplaced here. Answer B.\n"
