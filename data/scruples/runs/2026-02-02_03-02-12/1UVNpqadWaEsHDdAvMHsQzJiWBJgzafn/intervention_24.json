Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis, and he gets offended, calling her sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods, then said \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds that she doesn't want male genitalia, finds them uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend gets offended, says she's sexist, and storms off.\n\nThe author is defending her position by pointing out the boyfriend's own behaviors (scratching his nuts, adjusting his junk), which he was previously trashing vaginas and periods. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let me think about the dynamics here. The boyfriend's initial comments seem dismissive of women's experiences with menstruation, which is a valid issue. The author is pushing back against his assumption that having a penis is better. She's expressing her personal preference, which is a legitimate right. However, the boyfriend feels called out and labels her as sexist. \n\nSexism typically involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender. The author isn't making a broad statement about all men or women; she's stating her own feelings. Saying she doesn't want a penis because of the discomfort doesn't inherently make her sexist. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from feeling attacked or defensive about his own body. \n\nBut wait, could there be an element of generalization? If she's implying that all women feel this way or that having a penis is inferior, that might be different. But in the given context, she's talking about her own perspective. \n\nThe boyfriend's initial comments about periods being something he's glad not to deal with could be seen as minimizing women's experiences. The author's response is a counterpoint, pointing out the downsides of male anatomy. She's highlighting that neither gender's biological aspects are entirely pleasant. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is expressing her honest feelings. The boyfriend's offense might be misplaced if he's being hypocritical\u2014since he was making negative comments about periods and then gets upset when his partner points out the negatives of his anatomy. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing her personal preferences. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be an overreaction, especially since he was the one who initiated the conversation with his own negative remarks. The key here is that the author isn't being sexist by rejecting the idea of having a penis; she's simply stating her comfort zone. The boyfriend's labeling her as sexist is incorrect in this context. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
