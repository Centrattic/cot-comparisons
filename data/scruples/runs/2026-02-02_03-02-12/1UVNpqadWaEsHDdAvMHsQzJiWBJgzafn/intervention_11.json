Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the boyfriend makes a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with the author's period, then says something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds with \"no, not really,\" explaining that male genitals seem uncomfortable. The boyfriend gets offended, calls her sexist, and storms off. The author is confused because he was criticizing periods and vaginas earlier.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the boyfriend's initial comment, the author's response, and the boyfriend's reaction. The author is stating her honest feelings about not wanting male anatomy, pointing out the discomforts she observes in her partner. The boyfriend's reaction is to label her sexist, which might be a deflection since he was making derogatory remarks about female anatomy first. \n\nI need to consider if the author's response is a reasonable reaction. She's expressing her personal preferences based on her observations. It's her body and her preferences, so she's not wrong for having them. The boyfriend's offense seems misplaced, especially since he initiated the conversation with his own negative comments. Calling someone sexist for expressing personal preferences about anatomy doesn't make sense here. The author isn't making a broad statement about all men or women, just her own feelings. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's behavior of storming off and telling her to think about it might be more about his own defensiveness rather than any valid point. The author isn't in the wrong for standing by her opinion. So, answer B (No) seems correct.\n"
