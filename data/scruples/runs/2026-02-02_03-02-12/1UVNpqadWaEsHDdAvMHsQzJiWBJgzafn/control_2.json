Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a couple having a discussion where the boyfriend comments on the author's period, and then they get into an argument about preferring not having a penis.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend says something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick\" when she's on her period. The author responds that she doesn't want a penis because she finds male genitals uncomfortable and messy. The boyfriend gets offended and calls her sexist. Then he storms off, but he was previously making negative comments about vaginas and periods.\n\nI need to determine if the author is wrong here. The key points are mutual criticism and the context of the argument. The boyfriend made a comment that could be seen as minimizing her experience with periods. Then the author counters by explaining her reasons for not wanting a penis, which is a personal preference. The boyfriend's reaction is to call her sexist, which might be an overreaction. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe boyfriend's initial comment could be seen as dismissive of her period struggles. The author's response is about her personal comfort and observations. She's not making a general statement about all men or their bodies, just her own feelings. The boyfriend's offense might stem from feeling criticized, but his prior comments were also negative. In such cases, both might have contributed, but the author's response seems reasonable given his initial remark. The term \"sexist\" here might be a misapplication because she's not judging an entire gender but expressing her personal preference based on her observations. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. The answer would be B.\n"
