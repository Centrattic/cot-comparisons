Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told her boyfriend she doesn't want to have a penis, and he got offended, calling her sexist. She's confused because he was making negative comments about vaginas and periods earlier.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the dynamics here. The boyfriend made a comment implying that having a vagina and dealing with periods is a downside, suggesting that not having a penis is a bad thing. The author responded by expressing her discomfort with male genitalia, which he took as sexist. \n\nThe key points are about mutual respect and the nature of their argument. The boyfriend's initial remarks were dismissive of women's experiences (periods, vaginas), which could be seen as degrading. The author is defending her perspective, pointing out the discomforts of male anatomy. She's not making a broad generalization about all men, but rather stating her personal preference based on observations.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction might stem from feeling criticized about his own body, but his initial comments were also problematic. The author isn't making a sexist statement; she's responding to his. The argument seems to be about differing views on body parts and their inconveniences. The boyfriend's offense might be misplaced, especially since he started by trashing the author's experience. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't in the wrong here. She's asserting her viewpoint in response to his. The boyfriend's reaction of calling her sexist and storming off could be an overreaction, especially if he's unwilling to acknowledge his own earlier comments. The situation is more about communication issues rather than one party being clearly at fault. The author's response is a valid personal opinion, not a sexist remark. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
