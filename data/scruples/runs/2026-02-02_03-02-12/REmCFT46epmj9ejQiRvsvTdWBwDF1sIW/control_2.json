My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're at fault for changing their name from a male name to a female one. Their parents named them after their grandpa, using a traditionally male name. The person feels it's causing them issues, like being teased, and they want to use a nickname derived from their last name. Their mom is upset and doesn't approve, even threatening not to accept the new name.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's right to choose their name. In many places, adults can legally change their names for any reason, so that's a point in their favor. They've been using the nickname for a long time, which makes it feel more like their real name now. The fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname too, which supports their choice.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents might feel hurt because the name was a tribute to the grandfather. The mom's reaction is about respecting family tradition. But the person is an adult now, so their autonomy is important. The teasing is a valid issue affecting their well-being. The parent's disapproval is personal, but the person has the legal right to change their name. \n\nSo, the key points are autonomy vs. family tradition. The person isn't in the wrong because they're making a choice that affects their life and happiness. The parents' feelings are valid, but it's the individual's right to decide their name. Therefore, the answer should be B, they are not in the wrong.\n"
