My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name to a female one, despite their parents' disapproval. The parents named the author after the grandfather, which was a kind gesture, but they didn't use a female version. The author has been teased for the name and wants to change both first and last names to a nickname derived from their last name. The mom is upset and says she won't accept the new name.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is 21 and engaged, so they're an adult and can make their own decisions. The name change is about their identity and comfort, especially since they've been teased. The nickname has been used by friends and their fianc\u00e9, indicating it's well-established. The parents' disapproval is based on honoring the grandfather, but the author feels the nickname is more authentic to them now.\n\nName changes are generally a personal choice, especially when it affects mental health and well-being. The parents' stance is about tradition and memory, but the author's right to self-identify is also important. Even though the parents are hurt, the decision to change one's name is a personal one, and the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing their happiness and identity. The fact that they\u2019re in a relationship and the fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname supports the idea that it's a natural progression for the author. The mother's reaction is emotional, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong to proceed. So, the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
