My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a girl wants to change her name from a male name her parents gave her, which was named after her grandfather. She's been teased for it, and now she's 21 and engaged. She wants to legally change both her first and last name to a nickname based on her current last name. Her mom is upset because she feels it's forsaking her grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The name was given by her parents, intended as a tribute to her grandfather. However, the name is a male name without a female equivalent, and she's been mocked for it. The nickname is what friends and her fianc\u00e9 use, so it's her preferred name. She's an adult now, so legally she can change her name without parental consent. \n\nHer mom's disapproval is strong, but does that make the author wrong? Well, name changes are personal choices. Even if the name was given with good intentions, the person has the right to choose a name that feels authentic to them. The fact that she's been using the nickname for so long and the name has caused her distress (being teased) might justify the change. The mother's feelings about honoring her grandfather are valid, but they don't override the adult child's right to self-identify. \n\nIn many cultures, changing your name is a personal decision, especially in adulthood. The mother might feel hurt or disrespected, but the daughter isn't necessarily wrong for choosing a name that aligns with her identity and brings her comfort. The key here is autonomy and the impact of the name on her well-being versus the family's sentiment. Since she's not forcing others to use the new name, just legally changing it for herself, it's more about her personal identity than disregarding her family's feelings entirely. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's making a choice that affects her own life and happiness, and while her mother is upset, the daughter isn't obligated to keep a name that causes her discomfort, especially when it's been a source of teasing and doesn't fit her gender identity or personal preference.\n"
