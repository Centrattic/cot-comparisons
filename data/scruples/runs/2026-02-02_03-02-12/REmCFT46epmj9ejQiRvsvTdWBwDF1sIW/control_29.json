My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their name from a male name given by their parents (after their grandfather) to a nickname that their friends use. They've faced teasing at school and are now 21, engaged, and want to use the nickname as their official name. Their mom is upset, thinking they're dishonoring the grandfather.\n\nFirst, the right to name oneself is a personal choice. At 21, the person is an adult, so they're within their rights to legally change their name. The parents gave a name that's problematic for the person, maybe without considering the gender aspect. The nickname is likely more comfortable and authentic for them. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but the decision is the person's to make. The fianc\u00e9 supports the nickname, which adds to the validity of their choice. While honoring family is important, the individual's well-being and identity shouldn't be sacrificed. So, the answer is B.\n"
