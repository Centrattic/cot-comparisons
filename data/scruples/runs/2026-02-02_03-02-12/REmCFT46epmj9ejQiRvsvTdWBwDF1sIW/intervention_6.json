My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she's a girl with a male name, \"John,\" which is a nickname. Her parents named her after her grandfather, but they didn't use the female version of the name. She's been teased for it, and now she's 21 and wants to legally change both her first and last name to a nickname derived from her current last name. Her mom is upset, saying she's forsaking her grandfather's memory and won't accept the new name.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is an adult, which is important. She's making a decision about her own identity. Changing her name is a personal choice, and she's been using the nickname for a long time. The fact that she's been teased and that her fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname supports her argument that this name feels more like hers. Her parents, especially her mom, are against it, but they can't prevent her from changing her name once she's an adult.\n\nLegally, in most places, adults can change their names without parental consent. So the author isn't breaking any laws. The moral aspect is trickier. Her mom feels it's about honoring her grandfather, but the author is prioritizing her own comfort and identity. There's a conflict between honoring family tradition and personal identity. However, the author's reasoning seems valid because she's trying to align her name with her self-identity and reduce the negative experiences she's had.\n\nThe fact that her parents didn't use the female version of the name when naming her could be a point in her favor. If they had made the name more gender-appropriate, maybe this situation wouldn't have arisen. Also, the nickname has been a part of her social identity for years, so changing to that makes sense.\n\nI don't see any malicious intent from the author. She's not trying to erase her grandfather's memory entirely, just choosing a name that fits her better. Her mother's disapproval is hurtful, but the author has the right to make this choice for herself. The answer is likely B, that she's not in the wrong.\n"
