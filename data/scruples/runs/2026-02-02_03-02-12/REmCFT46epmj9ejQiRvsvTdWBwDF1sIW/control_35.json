My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name given by their parents to a nickname that they've used and which their fianc\u00e9 uses. The parents are upset because the name was after the grandfather, and the mom thinks changing it is forsaking his memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's reasons. They mentioned being teased at school for their name, which is a valid concern. Using a nickname that they've always used in social settings makes it feel more like their own. The fianc\u00e9 also uses it, so it's part of their personal identity now.\n\nOn the parent's side, they named the person after the grandfather, which was a meaningful gesture. The mom feels hurt and thinks the person is disregarding the grandfather's memory. But the person's choice is about their own comfort and identity, which is a personal decision.\n\nIn many cultures, people do change their names for reasons related to their identity or to feel more at ease. While it's important to respect family feelings, the individual's right to self-identify is significant. The parents' disapproval is hurtful, but the person isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing their own well-being and identity.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), because the person isn't wrong for wanting to use a name that feels authentic to them, even if it causes some family tension. The key points are personal identity, comfort, and the fact that the nickname has been used long-term. The parents' feelings are valid, but the individual's choice is about their own life and happiness.\n"
