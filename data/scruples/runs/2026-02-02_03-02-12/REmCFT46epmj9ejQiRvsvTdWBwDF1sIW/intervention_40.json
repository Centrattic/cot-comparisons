My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name (like John) given by their parents, to a nickname that's more gender-appropriate. The parents named them after their grandfather, but didn't do the female version. The author has been teased for the name, is now 21, engaged, and wants to legally change both first and last names. The mom is against it, saying she won't accept the new name and thinks it's forsaking the grandfather's memory. The author uses the nickname already in social settings and their fianc\u00e9 uses it too.\n\nSo, first, the author's right to change their name. In many places, adults can legally change their names if they want, especially for personal reasons like gender identity or comfort. The fact that they're 21 and in a committed relationship might support their autonomy. Their parents' disapproval is a family matter but doesn't override their legal right to change their name.\n\nNext, the parents' perspective. They named the author after the grandfather, which the author appreciates but the name itself isn't gendered. The parents might feel the name is a family legacy, and changing it could be seen as disregarding that. But the author is making a choice about their own identity, which is a significant aspect of autonomy. The fact that they've been teased and use a nickname already shows that the name has caused distress and isn't serving them well socially.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy versus familial expectations. The author is an adult making a decision that affects their own life and happiness. While the parents' feelings are valid, they don't have the authority to stop an adult child from changing their name. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing their own well-being and identity. The nickname being used in social contexts and by their fianc\u00e9 supports the idea that the author's chosen name is integral to how they express themselves now.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because they're exercising their right to self-identify and address issues caused by a name that doesn't fit their gender or personal identity, especially when it's been a source of distress.\n"
