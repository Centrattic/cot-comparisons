My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the person is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their name. They were given a male name by their parents, which is a family name after their grandpa. They like the gesture but the name is causing issues because it's a short male name without a girly nickname. They've been teased and now they want to change their first and last name to a nickname their friends use. Their mom is upset, saying she won't accept the new name and that it's forsaking their grandpa's memory. The fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname already.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's right to choose their name. In many places, adults can legally change their names if they want. The fact that they're 21 and engaged suggests they're an adult making their own decisions. The parents' disapproval is a factor, but does that make the person wrong? The name change is for their own comfort and to address teasing, which is a valid personal reason. The mom's argument is about honoring the grandfather, but the person is still using the nickname in social contexts, so maybe it's about identity versus tradition. The key here is that the person is an adult, the name change is their legal right, and the parent's disapproval doesn't necessarily mean the person is at fault. So the answer would be B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
