My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for changing their name. The person is a woman named after her grandfather with a male name, which she's been teased for. She wants to change her first and last name to a nickname derived from her current last name, which her friends use. Her mom is upset and says she's forsaking her grandfather's memory. The fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname.\n\nFirst, the key points here are autonomy over one's identity and the impact of the name on the person's life. The author has faced bullying, which is significant. Choosing a name that makes her feel more comfortable and authentic is a personal decision. The mother's disapproval is based on honoring the grandfather, but the author is redefining her identity. The fianc\u00e9's support is also a factor. Legally, adults can change their names as long as it's not for fraudulent purposes. Emotionally, the author's well-being seems important here. The mother's feelings are valid, but the author's right to self-identify might outweigh that. The answer would likely be B, not in the wrong.\n"
