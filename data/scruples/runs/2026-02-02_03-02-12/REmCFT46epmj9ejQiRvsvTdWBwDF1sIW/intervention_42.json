My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their name from a male name given by their parents to a nickname that's more fitting for them. Their parents named them after their grandfather, but the name is a short male name without a girly version. They've been teased at school and now they're 21 and want to change both their first and last name to a nickname they've used. Their mom is upset and says she won't accept the new name.\n\nSo, the question is whether they're in the wrong for going ahead with the name change despite their mom's disapproval. \n\nFirst, I need to consider their age. They're 21 and engaged, so adults. They have the legal right to change their name. The parents might feel hurt because they see it as disregarding their grandfather's memory, but the person is making a choice that affects their own identity. They've been using the nickname for a long time, and their fianc\u00e9 uses it too. That suggests it's important to their self-identification.\n\nName changes are personal. People often change names for various reasons like gender identity, cultural reasons, or just personal preference. The parents' reaction is emotional, but the individual has the right to their own identity. The fact that they were teased for the name adds to the justification, as it's impacting their social life and self-esteem.\n\nThe parents might feel that the name is part of family tradition and honoring the grandfather. However, the person is also honoring their identity and possibly finding a way to respect the grandfather's memory in a different form by using a nickname derived from their last name. It's a balance between family ties and personal choice. Since the person is an adult, the decision should be theirs, even if it causes some family tension. They aren't in the wrong for prioritizing their own identity and well-being.\n"
