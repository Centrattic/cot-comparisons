My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name to a female one, which was given in honor of their grandfather. The parents named them after the grandfather, but the author feels it's a boy's name and has been teased for it. Now they want to change both their first and last names to a nickname that friends use, even though the parents disapprove.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the reasons the author has for wanting to change their name. They mention being teased in school, which is a significant issue. Being made fun of for one's name can affect self-esteem and social interactions. The name chosen by the parents was well-intentioned, honoring the grandfather, but it doesn't fit the author's identity. The author has used the nickname for a long time, and even the fianc\u00e9 uses it, which suggests that this new name is important to their personal identity.\n\nThe parents' disapproval is a factor here. The mother's reaction is strong\u2014she refuses to accept the new name and feels the author is forsaking the grandfather's memory. But does that make the author wrong? Well, the right to choose one's name is a personal choice, especially when it's about personal comfort and identity. The parents can disapprove, but the author has the legal right to change their name. The key here is whether the author is harming others by making this change. The parents might feel hurt, but the author is not wrong for prioritizing their own well-being and identity. \n\nAlso, the author is an adult, so they have the autonomy to make decisions about their name. The parents might not like it, but it's their right to choose. The fact that the nickname is derived from their current last name might mitigate some of the grandfather's name issue, but the first name change is still a big deal. However, the author's reasons are personal and valid. They've been using the nickname socially, so changing the legal name aligns their official identity with how they're known, which can prevent future issues, especially in their professional life and with their spouse.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a choice that affects their own life and happiness, even if it disappoints their parents. The parents' disapproval is a consequence, but the author isn't wrong for following through.\n"
