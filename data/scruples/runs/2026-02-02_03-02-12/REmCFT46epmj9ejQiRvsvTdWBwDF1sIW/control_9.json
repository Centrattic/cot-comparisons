My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about changing their name from a male name given by parents to a nickname they've used all their life. The parents named them after the grandfather, but the name is a male one, and the person feels it's not suitable. They face teasing and want to change their name, but the mom is upset and thinks they're dishonoring the grandfather. The fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, and the person uses it socially.\n\nSo, first, I need to consider the key points. The person was given a name that doesn't fit their gender, leading to bullying. They want to change their legal name to a nickname they've used for years. The parents disapprove, especially the mom, who feels it's disrespectful to the grandfather. The question is whether the person is in the wrong for changing their name despite this.\n\nLegally, in most places, you can change your name if you want, unless there are specific restrictions. The main ethical issue here is about respecting family and tradition versus personal identity and well-being. The person is an adult, 21, so they have autonomy. The name change is for their own comfort and to avoid ongoing teasing, which is a valid reason. The nickname has been used socially for a long time, so it's part of their identity now. The mother's disapproval is about honoring the grandfather, but the person might feel the original name doesn't represent them, and changing it isn't forsaking the memory\u2014it's just adapting their identity. The grandfather's name was a gesture, but the person isn't rejecting the gesture; they're choosing a name that fits better. The fianc\u00e9's support also shows that the new name is accepted in their personal life. So, the person isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're making a choice that affects their own life and happiness. The mother's feelings are important, but the adult child's autonomy and well-being should take precedence. Therefore, the answer is B, No.\n"
