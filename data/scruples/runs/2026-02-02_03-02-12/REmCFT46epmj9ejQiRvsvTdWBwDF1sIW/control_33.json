My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for wanting to change their name. Their parents gave them a male name, which the person finds problematic because they're a girl. The name is causing them issues, like being mocked in school. They want to change both their first and last names to a nickname they've used with friends. Their mom is upset, saying they're disrespecting their grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights of the individual vs. family traditions. The person is 21 and engaged, so they're adults now. Legally, they can change their name if they want. The key points here are their well-being and autonomy. If the name is causing them distress and affecting their life, changing it might be a reasonable choice. The mother's disapproval is a factor, but it's not about right or wrong in a legal or moral sense. The person might feel it's important to use a name that aligns with their identity and how they're perceived, especially since their fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname. The grandfather's name was a family tradition, but the person is making a choice that affects their own life. So, I think the author isn't in the wrong. They're prioritizing their comfort and identity, which is valid.\n"
