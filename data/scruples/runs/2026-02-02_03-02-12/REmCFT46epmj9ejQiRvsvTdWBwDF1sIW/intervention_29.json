My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for changing her name from a male name to a nickname she's used socially. The parents named her after her grandfather, but the name is a short male name without a female version. She's faced teasing and now wants to change both her first and last name to a nickname that's based on her current last name. Her mom is against it, saying she'd never accept the new name and that it's forsaking her grandfather's memory. The author is considering doing it anyway because it feels more like her name now.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are the reasons for the name change, the parents' reaction, and the social aspects. The author has been using the nickname for a long time, which her friends and fianc\u00e9 use. The original name was given by parents as a tribute to the grandfather, but it's causing her distress due to teasing. The mother's disapproval is strong, even to the point of being \"insanely mad.\"\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Legally, in many places, adults can change their names for any reason they choose, especially if they're of age. The ethical question is more about respecting family tradition versus personal identity. The author's argument is that the name isn't fitting her identity and she feels it's her right to choose a name that she's comfortable with. The mother's side is about honoring the grandfather's memory, but the author might feel that keeping a name that causes her pain isn't truly honoring him.\n\nAlso, the fact that the nickname is based on her own last name might make it less about rejecting the family name and more about personal preference. If the last name is changing as part of marriage, that's a common reason for a name change anyway. So combining both first and last name changes might be a way to have a cohesive new name that she identifies with.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because she's an adult making a personal choice that affects her own life. The parents, while they can be upset, can't control her decision once she's an adult. The disapproval is hurtful, but her right to self-identify with a name that's been her social name for years seems valid. The grandfather's memory is important, but the name was given with a male name, which the author can't change into a female version. So changing the name isn't necessarily forsaking the memory but finding a fit that works for her.\n"
