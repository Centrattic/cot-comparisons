My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for changing their name. The person was given a male name by their parents, named after their grandfather, but feels it's causing issues because it's not a typical female name. They want to legally change both their first and last names to a nickname that friends use. The mom is upset and says she'll never accept the new name.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The person's name is a short male name without a girly nickname, leading to teasing. They've used a nickname socially for a long time, even their fianc\u00e9 uses it. The parents named them after the grandfather, but didn't use the female version. The mother is upset, thinking it's forsaking the grandfather's memory.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a personal autonomy perspective, adults have the right to choose their own name. The name was given at birth, but the individual's identity and comfort matter. The mother's disapproval is personal but doesn't override the individual's right to self-identify. Also, the nickname has been used for years, indicating it's been a part of their identity.\n\nHowever, cultural or familial expectations might play a role. Some might argue respecting family tradition is important. But the name given caused them distress, especially in social settings. The balance between honoring family and personal well-being is key here.\n\nIn legal terms, changing a name is possible, so the author isn't breaking any laws. The emotional aspect of the mother's reaction is valid, but the author's feelings and life experiences also matter. The fianc\u00e9's support adds another layer, showing the nickname is accepted in their close personal life.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to their identity and comfort, especially since the name has been problematic. The mother's feelings are important, but the author's autonomy is more critical here. So the answer should be B.\n"
