My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wants to change their name is in the wrong. The situation is that the person was given a male name, \"John,\" by their parents, which was in honor of their grandfather. The person has been teased for it and now wants to legally change both their first and last name to a nickname that friends use, which is based on their current last name. Their mom is upset and says she won't accept the new name, thinking it's forsaking the grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's right to change their name. In many places, adults have the legal right to change their names for personal reasons. The fact that they're 21 and engaged suggests they're an adult making a personal decision. The parent's disapproval is a family issue, but it doesn't necessarily make the person wrong for wanting to change their name, especially if it's affecting their well-being due to being teased.\n\nThe person mentions that they've always used the nickname socially, even with their fianc\u00e9. This implies that the nickname is how they've been known, so changing the legal name to match might make sense for consistency and authenticity. The original name was given with good intentions, but the person is choosing a name that feels more like theirs. It's about personal identity and comfort.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent's perspective is about honoring the grandfather. The parent might feel that changing the name dishonors him. But the person is not rejecting the grandfather's memory entirely\u2014just not using the name that was given in his honor. There's a cultural or family tradition aspect here, but individual rights to self-identify are also important.\n\nThe key factors are: personal identity, right to self-identify, family tradition vs. personal choice, and the impact of the name on the person's life (like being teased). The parent's disapproval is significant, but it's their choice to change their own name. They're not forcing the parents to like it, just exercising their right. So, the person isn't in the wrong for wanting to change their name to better reflect their identity, even if it disappoints their family.\n"
