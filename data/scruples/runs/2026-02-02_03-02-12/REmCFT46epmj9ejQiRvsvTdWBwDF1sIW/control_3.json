My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for wanting to change their name. The person was given a male name by their parents, which is causing them issues with being teased and now they want to change it. The parents don't approve because it's connected to the grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's reasons. They mentioned being teased in school and wanting to use a nickname that feels more like their identity. Also, their fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, so it's part of their current identity. The parents are upset because the original name was a tribute to the grandfather, but the person feels it's not suitable for them.\n\nIn terms of rights, people generally have the right to change their names, especially if it's affecting their well-being. The parents' feelings are important, but the individual's autonomy is also a key factor. It's possible that the parents are prioritizing tradition over the child's comfort and identity. The nickname being used by friends and the fianc\u00e9 suggests that the community already accepts this name, which might indicate that the change is a natural extension of how the person presents themselves.\n\nHowever, there's a cultural aspect too. Sometimes names carry significant family history, and changing them might be seen as disrespecting that. But the person isn't rejecting the grandfather's memory entirely\u2014they\u2019re just changing the name they use. The parents\u2019 disapproval is causing conflict, but the person is an adult now, so their decision should be respected. \n\nI think the key points here are the impact on the person's life, their autonomy, and the fact that the change isn't just about changing a name but about aligning it with their identity. The parents\u2019 feelings are valid, but the person isn\u2019t in the wrong for prioritizing their own well-being and identity. So the answer should be B.\n"
