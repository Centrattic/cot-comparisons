My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their name from a male name (like John) that was given by their parents, named after their grandfather. They mention being teased throughout school and now want to change both first and last names to a nickname based on their current last name. Their mom is upset, saying they're forsaking their grandfather's memory and won't accept the new name.\n\nFirst, the right to change one's name is a personal choice. In many places, it's a legal right. The individual is taking responsibility for their identity, which is important. They've been using the nickname for a long time, so it's part of their self-identity. The parents' disapproval is understandable, especially since the name was chosen in memory of their grandpa. But the person's well-being and comfort should also be considered. The mom's reaction might stem from feeling that the name change dishonors the grandfather, but the person isn't rejecting the name entirely\u2014they're creating a variation that's already known to friends and family. The fianc\u00e9's use of the nickname supports the idea that this is a natural extension of their identity. The key here is balancing respect for family history with personal identity. The person isn't wrong for prioritizing their own comfort and happiness, even if it causes some family tension. So the answer is B.\n"
