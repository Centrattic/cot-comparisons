My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about changing their name from a male name (like John) that was given by their parents, who named them after their grandfather. The person is now 21, engaged, and wants to legally change both their first and last names to a nickname based on their current last name, which friends have used. Their mom is upset, saying she won't accept the new name and thinks they're forsaking their grandfather's memory. The person is considering going through with it despite the mom's disapproval.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The person's name is a male name with no female equivalent, leading to being teased. They've used a nickname since childhood, even their fianc\u00e9 uses it. The parents named them after the grandfather, but the person wants to change their legal name now. The mom disapproves, but the person is an adult and in a committed relationship.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, in many places, adults can legally change their names. The parents can't stop them once they're adults. The person's right to self-identify and choose their name is important. The fact that the nickname has been used for years might support their argument that the change is about personal identity and well-being. The teasing issue adds to the emotional impact. The mom's disapproval is hurtful, but the person isn't a child anymore. The grandfather's memory is part of the parents' reasoning, but the person might not feel the name honors the grandfather in the way they need. The fianc\u00e9 using the nickname suggests that the new name is already integrated into their life.\n\nPossible counterpoints: The person could be seen as disregarding family traditions. However, personal identity and mental health are significant factors. The age of 21 is past childhood, so autonomy is key. The answer would likely lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the person has the right to change their name as an adult, especially if it's for their well-being and the name has been used in social contexts. The mom's disapproval is a personal issue but doesn't override the person's rights. So, the answer is B.\n"
