My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to change their name from a male name (like John) to a nickname based on their last name. Their parents named them after their grandfather, but the name isn't gendered, leading to teasing. The mom is upset and says she won't accept the new name.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's reasons. They've been teased, which is a valid reason for wanting a name change for self-esteem and social comfort. They've used the nickname all along, so it feels more like their real name now. The fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, which suggests it's important for their identity and relationships.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents' feelings matter too. The name was a tribute to the grandfather, and the mother feels it's being forsaken. But the person is an adult, 21, so they have the right to make decisions about their own name. Legal name changes are common for various reasons, including escaping teasing or aligning with one's identity.\n\nIs the person in the wrong? Probably not. They have a legitimate reason related to their well-being and personal identity. While it's respectful to consider family feelings, the final decision rests with the individual. The mother's disapproval doesn't automatically make the person wrong. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
