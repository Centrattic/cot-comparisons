My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to change their name from a male name (like \"John\") to a nickname that's more gender-appropriate for them. The context is that their parents named them after their grandfather, but didn't use the female version. The author has been teased about the name in school and now, at 21 and engaged, wants to legally change both their first and last names. Their mom is upset about it, saying she won't accept the new name and thinks it dishonors the grandfather.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights of the individual versus the family's feelings. The author is an adult, so they have the legal right to change their name. Name changes are common for various reasons, including gender identity, personal preference, or to avoid discrimination. The fact that they've been teased about the name suggests that it's causing them emotional distress, which is a valid reason to seek a change.\n\nThe mother's reaction is about honoring the grandfather, but the author has a different perspective. They feel the nickname is more authentic to them, especially since friends and their fianc\u00e9 use it. The grandfather's name was chosen with good intentions, but the author isn't necessarily rejecting the memory; they're redefining their own identity. At 21, they're making a personal choice about their identity, which is their right. The mother's disapproval adds emotional weight, but it doesn't make the author wrong. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, many people change their names for similar reasons. Marrying and changing a last name is a common practice. The key here is autonomy. The author is choosing a name that aligns with their self-identity, which is important for mental health and well-being. The fact that they're doing it for both first and last names indicates a strong personal connection to the new name. \n\nHowever, there's the aspect of family values and respecting ancestors. The mother might feel that the grandfather's memory is being dishonored. But the author isn't erasing the name entirely; they're using a nickname derived from the original last name. That could be a way to honor both the grandfather and their own identity. \n\nIn summary, while the mother's feelings are understandable, the author's decision to change their name seems to be a valid personal choice. They have the legal right, and the emotional impact of keeping a name that causes distress is significant. So, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
