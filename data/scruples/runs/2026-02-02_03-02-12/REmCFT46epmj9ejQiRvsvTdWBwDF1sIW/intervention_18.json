My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong when changing their name from a male name to a nickname version. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is a girl named after her grandfather, but the name is typically a male one like \"John\". Her parents didn't use the female version. The name is short and not girly, leading to teasing in school. Now that she's 21 and engaged, she wants to change both her first and last names to a nickname based on her current last name, which her friends have always used. Her mom is against it, saying she wouldn't accept the new name and feels it's forsaking her grandfather's memory. The author is considering going ahead despite her mom's disapproval.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I should consider the right to name oneself. In many places, adults have the legal right to change their names. The author is 21, so she's an adult. Choosing a name that reflects her identity, especially one she's been using socially, seems like a personal choice. The teasing she experienced could be a valid reason for wanting to change it for her well-being.\n\nHer parents' feelings are important, but they don't have the authority to stop her as an adult. The fact that the nickname is already used by friends and her fianc\u00e9 suggests that it's a name she's been associated with, which might be more meaningful to her identity now.\n\nHowever, the mother feels it's forsaking her grandfather's memory. There's a cultural or familial aspect here. The grandfather's name was a significant gesture from the parents, but the author might feel that the name doesn't fit her identity. It's a conflict between honoring family tradition and personal identity.\n\nI need to weigh these factors. Legally and ethically, the right to self-determination in name changes generally supports the author. Emotional impact on the mother is a valid concern, but the author's own well-being and sense of self are also important. The mother's disapproval doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. She has the right to choose a name that makes her feel comfortable, especially after experiencing teasing. Her relationship with her mother might be strained, but changing her name isn't inherently wrong. The key points are legal right, personal identity, and well-being versus family tradition. The latter is important but doesn't override the individual's rights as an adult.\n"
