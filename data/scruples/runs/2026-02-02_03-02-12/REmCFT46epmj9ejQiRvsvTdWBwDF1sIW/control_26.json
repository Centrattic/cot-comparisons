My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for wanting to change their name. The person is a woman with a male name, John, which her parents gave her in memory of her grandfather. She's been teased for it and wants to legally change both her first and last name to a nickname her friends use. Her mom is upset and says she'd never accept the new name.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights of an adult to change their name. In most places, adults can legally change their names without needing permission from family. So from a legal standpoint, she's within her rights. The question is more about moral or social wrongdoing. \n\nThe user's main arguments are about identity and self-expression. She says she's always used the nickname and her fianc\u00e9 uses it too. The name change is about how she wants to present herself, especially since the original name has been a source of teasing. This relates to personal autonomy. \n\nHer mother's disapproval is about honoring the grandfather's memory. But the mother's feelings are important, but does that give her authority over the daughter's decision? Since the daughter is an adult, her decision should be respected. The mother might feel hurt, but it's not the daughter's responsibility to prioritize her mother's feelings over her own well-being unless there's a specific cultural expectation, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nThere's also the aspect of chosen family. The fianc\u00e9 and friends already use the nickname, so changing the legal name would align with her social identity. This could affect her sense of self and how others perceive her. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say respecting family traditions is important, but again, the daughter is an adult making a choice that affects her own life. The mother's disapproval is a personal issue but doesn't necessarily make the daughter in the wrong. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the daughter has a valid reason based on her own identity and well-being. She's not obligating her mother to accept it, just changing her own name. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
