My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a woman who was given a male name (like John) by her parents, who named her after her grandfather. She's been teased for it and now wants to legally change her name to a nickname that's more feminine, which her friends have used. Her mom is upset and says she's dishonoring her grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, the core issue is about identity and autonomy. The woman is choosing a name that feels more authentic to her. Being teased and feeling out of place with her given name is a significant personal issue. She's an adult now, so she has the legal right to change her name if she wants. Her parents' disapproval is understandable, but shouldn't override her own sense of self.\n\nHer mother's argument about honoring her grandfather is about tradition and family ties. However, the woman's choice isn't necessarily disrespecting him; she might still honor him in her own way. The key here is that she's making a decision that affects her own life and happiness. The fianc\u00e9 using the nickname shows that this isn't just a passing phase but a consistent part of her identity.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Probably not. She's asserting her identity and right to self-determination. The mother's feelings are valid, but they don't make the woman wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
