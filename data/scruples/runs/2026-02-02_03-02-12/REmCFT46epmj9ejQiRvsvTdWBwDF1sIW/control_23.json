My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name to a female one, especially since it was named after their grandfather. The parents disapprove, but the person has been using a nickname all along and wants to formalize it now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and personal aspects. Naming is a personal choice, and many people change their names for various reasons like gender identity, personal preference, or to better fit their identity. The original name was a male name given by parents, but the individual feels it doesn't suit them. They've been using a nickname for a long time, which suggests they've already been living under that name socially.\n\nThe parents' disapproval is based on honoring the grandfather's memory, but the individual's well-being and personal identity might be more important. If the name has caused them distress and the nickname is more authentic to them, changing it could be a positive step. However, the parents' feelings are valid too, but the decision to change one's name is a personal one and often a right that adults have. The fianc\u00e9 using the nickname also shows social acceptance.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the general consensus often leans towards supporting the person's right to self-identify, especially when it's about personal happiness. The parents' disapproval might lead to conflict, but the individual isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to change their name. So the answer is B, No.\n"
