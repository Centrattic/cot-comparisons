My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name to a female one. Let's see. The user is a girl named after her grandfather with a male name like John, which is causing her to be teased. She wants to change both her first and last name to a nickname her friends use, which ties into her current last name. Her mom is upset, saying she's forsaking her grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I should consider the person's reasons. She's being mocked for her name, which is tough. Being teased in school can have a lasting impact, so wanting to change the name for self-esteem or comfort makes sense. The fact that she's been using the nickname socially for a long time and her fianc\u00e9 uses it too shows that she's comfortable with it in her personal life. That might be a valid reason to want to use it officially.\n\nOn the other hand, her mother feels it's disrespectful to the grandfather. Changing the name could be seen as not honoring his memory, especially if the name was a deliberate choice. The mom's disapproval is strong here, but does that make the daughter wrong? Maybe not. People have different values. The daughter's right to choose her own identity versus the family's tradition. \n\nIn many places, people can legally change their names for personal reasons. So the right to do so exists. However, the emotional aspect with the family is complicated. The daughter might be prioritizing her own well-being over the family's traditions. But is that wrong? If changing her name brings her happiness and she's prepared to deal with family tensions, then maybe she's not in the wrong. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but it's her choice to make. \n\nI think the key points are her long-term discomfort with her name, the social usage of the nickname, and her fianc\u00e9 using it. The mother's feelings are important, but the daughter's autonomy and mental health are also significant. So the answer is probably B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
