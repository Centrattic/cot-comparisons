My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to change her name away from the male name her parents gave her, which was named after her grandfather. The main points here are about personal identity, family expectations, and the impact of the name change.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that her name is a boy's name, like John, without a girly nickname. She's been teased for it in school, which is significant because it affects her self-esteem and social interactions. Now, at 21 and engaged, she wants to legally change both her first and last names. Her mother disapproves, feeling she's forsaking her grandfather's memory. The fianc\u00e9 supports her by using the nickname.\n\nConsidering personal autonomy, adults have the legal right to change their names. The name was given by her parents, but she's an adult now, so the decision is hers. The fact that she's been using a nickname socially for a long time suggests that this new name aligns with her identity. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but the author's well-being is important. Changing her name could help her feel more comfortable in her own skin, especially since she's facing ongoing teasing. However, the cultural significance of the grandfather's name might weigh on the mother's side. But the author has the right to honor her grandfather in her own way without feeling forced to keep a name that's causing her distress. \n\nThe key factors here are her mental health, personal identity, and the right to self-determination. While the mother's feelings are valid, the author isn't wrong for prioritizing her own happiness and comfort. The answer leans towards B (No, she's not in the wrong) because she's making a choice that's best for herself as an adult, even if it upsets her family. It's about balancing respect for family with personal needs.\n"
