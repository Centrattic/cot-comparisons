My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for changing their name. The situation is that the author was given a male name by their parents, which they've been teased for. They want to change both their first and last name to a nickname they've used. Their mom is against it, saying it's forsaking their grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and cultural aspects. In many places, adults can legally change their names, so that's a right. The author is 21, so they're an adult. The parents giving a name that doesn't fit the child's gender could be an issue. The fact that the name is a male name and the author is female, leading to teasing, is a valid reason for wanting to change. The mom's disapproval is about the grandfather's memory, but the author uses the nickname as their preferred name already.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is wrong. The key points are autonomy, the reason for changing (to avoid bullying), and the fact that the nickname is already established. The parent's disapproval is emotional, but the author isn't wrong for prioritizing their well-being. So likely, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
