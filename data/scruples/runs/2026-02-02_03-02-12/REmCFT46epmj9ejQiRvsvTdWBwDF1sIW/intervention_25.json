My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for changing her name from a male name (like \"John\") to a nickname based on her last name. The parents named her after her grandfather, and now the mom is upset, saying she's forsaking his memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural context. In some cultures, changing your name to honor a family member or using a traditional name might be significant. But here, the author is changing her name because it's a male name with no female version and she's been mocked for it. She's been using the nickname for a long time, and her fianc\u00e9 uses it too. That suggests the name is a big part of her identity now.\n\nThe mom's argument is that she's disrespecting her grandfather. But the author's intention isn't to erase him; she just wants a name that feels right to her. It's important to respect personal identity and the impact of a name on one's self-esteem. If a name is causing her distress and she's been using a different one consistently, she has a valid reason. \n\nAlso, the author is an adult now, so she has the autonomy to make decisions about her name. While family opinions matter, they shouldn't override personal well-being. The mom's disapproval is hurtful, but the author's right to choose her name, especially if it's tied to her identity and happiness, seems justified. So, I think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
