My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their name from a male name (like John) to a nickname that's more feminine, which their friends have used. Their parents named them after their grandpa, but the name doesn't have a female version. They've been teased for it, and now they're 21, engaged, and want to legally change both their first and last name. The mom is upset, saying it's forsaking the grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, the person's right to self-identity. At 21, they're an adult, so the decision is theirs. The name was given to them but not fitting their gender identity. They've used the nickname socially for years, and their fianc\u00e9 uses it too. That suggests the new name is important for their self-identity. Family disapproval is a factor, but the mom's anger about the grandfather's name\u2014maybe that's about honoring ancestors, but the person's comfort and identity are personal. Legally changing a name is a common practice for many reasons, including gender expression. The mother's disapproval doesn't negate the individual's right to choose their name. The teasing and lifelong discomfort also support the need for the change. So the answer is likely B.\n"
