My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's look at this situation. The person is a woman named after her grandfather, but her name is a male name, like \"John.\" She's been teased about it in school and now wants to legally change both her first and last names. Her mom is upset because she feels it's forsaking the grandfather's memory. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, uses the nickname version of her last name.\n\nFirst, the right to change one's name is generally a personal choice, especially in many Western countries. People often change names for various reasons: personal identity, avoiding harassment, etc. The fact that she's been teased for years adds weight to her desire for a name that feels more authentic to her.\n\nHer mother's disapproval is about honoring her grandfather. But the grandfather's name was given with good intentions by her parents, but maybe they didn't consider the female equivalent. The woman's choice to use a nickname that her friends and fianc\u00e9 use is part of her identity now. She's been using it socially for years, so it's not a sudden change but an extension of how she's always been known.\n\nThe mother's reaction seems to stem from a place of respecting family legacy, but the daughter is making a choice that affects her own life and well-being. While the mother's feelings are valid, the daughter isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her own comfort and identity. It's a personal decision, and the mother's disapproval doesn't negate the daughter's right to choose her name.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
