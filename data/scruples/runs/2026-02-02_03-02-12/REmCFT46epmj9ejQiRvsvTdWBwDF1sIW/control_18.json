My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name to a female one, even though their parents named them after their grandfather. The person says they've been teased for their name, they're 21 and engaged, and want to use a nickname that friends use. Their mom is upset, saying they're forsaking the grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's reasons. They were given a male name with no female version, leading to being teased. That's a valid concern for wanting to change it. They're an adult now, so they have the right to make decisions about their identity. The nickname has been used by friends and their fianc\u00e9, which might make it feel more authentic to them now.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents had a reason for the name, honoring the grandfather. The mom's disapproval is about family memory. But the person is choosing to use a name that feels more like them. Changing names isn't uncommon when someone's identity doesn't align with their given name. The key here is that the person is an adult, so they can make this choice even if it upsets their parents.\n\nBut does changing the name disrespect the grandfather? Maybe the mom feels it's a rejection of family tradition. However, the person's well-being and comfort in their own name is also important. There's no legal wrong here, just a conflict of values. The person isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing their own identity and social comfort, especially after years of being teased. So the answer might be B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
