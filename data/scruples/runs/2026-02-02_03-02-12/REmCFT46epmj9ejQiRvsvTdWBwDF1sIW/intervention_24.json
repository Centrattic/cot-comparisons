My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for changing their name. The situation is that the author was given a male name by their parents, which was after the grandfather. The name is \"John,\" which doesn't have a female version and has caused her to be teased. Now she wants to change both her first and last name to a nickname her friends use, which is based on her current last name. Her mom is upset and thinks she's dishonoring her grandfather. The author is engaged and her fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The name was chosen by her parents, and while there's a sentiment behind it (honoring the grandfather), it's causing her distress. She's been teased, which affects her well-being. She's an adult, 21, so she has the legal right to change her name. The mother's disapproval is a concern, but the author is making a decision that affects her own life. The fianc\u00e9 supports the nickname, which is significant. \n\nChanging one's name is a personal choice, and while family traditions and memories are important, an individual's comfort and identity should be prioritized. The mother's reaction might stem from feeling that the name change disregards her grandfather's memory, but the author is not rejecting the grandfather entirely\u2014she's just changing her name to something that fits her better. The nickname being used by friends and her fianc\u00e9 suggests it's a name that's been accepted and familiar in her social circle. \n\nLegally, she can change her name, and ethically, she has the right to choose how she identifies. The mother's refusal to accept the new name is hurtful, but the author isn't obligated to keep a name that causes her pain. The main question is whether she's wrong for doing this despite her mom's disapproval. Since the name change affects her own life and relationships, and she's not harming others by changing it, she's likely in the right. The mother's feelings are valid, but the author's well-being is also important. So the answer is B.\n"
