My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong for changing her name. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is a woman named \"John,\" which is a male name. Her parents named her after her grandfather, but there's no female version provided. She's been teased for her name in school and now wants to change both her first and last name to a nickname that her friends use, which is derived from her current last name. Her fianc\u00e9 uses this nickname too. When she told her mom, she got a strong negative reaction\u2014her mom says she'd never accept the new name and thinks she's dishonoring her grandfather. The author is now 21 and engaged, so this is an adult decision affecting her personal identity.\n\nSo, the main points here are about personal identity, autonomy, and family expectations. The author has been using the nickname socially for a long time, and her fianc\u00e9 uses it as well. That suggests it's a name she feels comfortable with and identifies with now. The fact that she's an adult adds weight to her right to make this decision without her parents' approval. \n\nHer parents' reasoning is about honoring her grandfather by using his name. However, the original name was a male name given to a girl without a female equivalent, leading to teasing. That's a significant issue for her well-being. Changing her name could be a way to reclaim her identity and reduce the negative experiences tied to her current name. \n\nFrom a rights perspective, in many places, adults can legally change their names without family consent. The mother's disapproval is emotional but doesn't give her legal authority to stop the author. The author's mental health and personal comfort are important factors here. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's use of the nickname implies that the new name is already part of her social identity, which supports her desire to formalize it. The mother's stance might be about tradition or feeling the name is sacred, but the author's autonomy as an adult is key. \n\nPossible counterarguments might be that the author is being disrespectful to her grandfather's memory. However, the original intent of the parents was to honor the grandfather, but if the name causes her ongoing distress, changing it could be a way to honor both her identity and the spirit of the original gesture by having a name that works for her. \n\nConsidering all this, the author is making a personal choice that affects her life, and while her mother is upset, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her own well-being and identity. The answer should be B.\n"
