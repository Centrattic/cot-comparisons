My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to change their name. The person was given a male name by their parents, which is a name after the grandfather. They've been teased for it, and now they want to change it to a nickname that's been used by friends. Their mom is upset, saying they're forsaking their grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's right to their own identity. They're 21 and engaged, so they're an adult making their own decisions. The fact that they've been teased and have a nickname they use socially suggests that the new name is important to them. The parents gave them the name intending to honor the grandfather, but the person is choosing to use a different name that feels more like their own. That seems like a personal choice related to self-identity.\n\nThen there's the mom's reaction. She's upset and says she won't accept the new name. But as an adult, the individual has the right to choose their name, even if it upsets their parents. The parents can't force them to keep a name they don't want. The grandfather's name was given as a gesture, but the person is not rejecting the memory of the grandfather; they're just using a name that fits them better. The nickname comes from friends, so it's a part of their social identity.\n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, so it's integrated into their personal and romantic life. Changing the last name as well might be part of merging their identity with their partner, which is another personal choice. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but the person has the right to their own name. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
