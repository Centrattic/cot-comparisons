My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to change their name from a male name (like John) to a nickname based on their last name. Their parents named them after their grandfather, but it's a boy's name, and the person has been made fun of. Now they're 21, engaged, and want to change both first and last names. They mentioned their mom is upset and thinks they're forsaking their grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's perspective. They've been teased for their name, which is a valid issue. Being 21, they're an adult and have the legal right to change their name. The fact that they use a nickname socially and their fianc\u00e9 uses it too suggests they identify with that name more. The parent's disapproval is a conflict here, but does that make the author wrong?\n\nOn the other hand, the parents had good intentions by naming them after a grandparent. The mother feels it's forsaking the memory, which might be emotional for her. However, the user's well-being and comfort in their own identity is important. Adults can make decisions about their names regardless of family disapproval.\n\nSo, the core issue is autonomy versus family tradition. The user isn't harming others; they're choosing a name they feel comfortable with. The mother's reaction is hurtful, but the user's decision is about their own identity. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
