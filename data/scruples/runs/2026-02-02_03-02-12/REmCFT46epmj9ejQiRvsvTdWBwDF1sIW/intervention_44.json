My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for changing her name from a male name to a female one. The original name was given by her parents, inspired by her grandfather. She's been teased for it and wants to change it to a nickname that her friends use. Her mom is upset and says she'll never accept the new name.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the name was given for a reason (honoring grandpa), but the person feels it's not suitable for her identity and has faced teasing. She's an adult now, 21 and engaged, so she's making her own decisions. The mom's reaction is strong disapproval, but does that make her right or wrong?\n\nI need to consider the rights of an adult to change their name. In many places, adults can legally change their names without family approval. The person is choosing to take control of her identity, which is significant. The mother's feelings about honoring the grandfather are important, but they shouldn't override the daughter's well-being and self-identity. The nickname has been used by friends and fianc\u00e9, indicating it's been accepted socially. The mother's disapproval might be hurtful, but the daughter's right to choose her name is a personal matter.\n\nSo, the answer probably leans towards B (not in the wrong) because she's an adult with the right to choose her name, especially for her own comfort and identity. The mother's feelings are valid but don't make the daughter wrong in this case.\n"
