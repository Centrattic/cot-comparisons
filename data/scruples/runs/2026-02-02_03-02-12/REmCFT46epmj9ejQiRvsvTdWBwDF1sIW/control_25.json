My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person (a girl) is in the wrong for changing her name from a male name (like John) to a nickname that her friends use, which is based on her last name. Her parents named her after her grandfather, and they didn't use the female version. The mother is upset and thinks she's forsaking her grandfather's memory. The person wants to change both first and last names, and her fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The name was given by parents as a tribute to the grandfather, but it's a male name with no girly nickname. She's been teased for it. Now, she's 21 and wants to change it to a nickname she's used socially. The mother disapproves and says she won't accept the new name. The question is whether she's in the wrong for proceeding despite this.\n\nIn terms of rights, in many places, adults can legally change their names without parental consent once they're over 18. So legally, she can do it. But the question is about moral wrongness, not legality. The AITA (Am I the Asshole?) context usually focuses on social and moral aspects.\n\nArguments for her being right (B): She's an adult, so she has autonomy over her name. She's been teased, which affects her well-being. Using a nickname that's been accepted by friends and fianc\u00e9 shows it's meaningful to her. The original name was a family tradition (grandpa), but she's not erasing the name entirely\u2014maybe the nickname is derived from her current last name. She's choosing to honor her identity and comfort over parental disapproval, which is a common theme in adult independence.\n\nArguments for her being wrong (A): Disrespecting family tradition and her grandfather's memory. The parents intended the name as a tribute, so changing it could be seen as disregarding their wishes and the family's values. The mother's disapproval might lead to family conflict, which could be seen as selfish if it's unnecessary. However, if the name caused her lifelong distress, the balance might tip in her favor.\n\nThe key here is the intent and the impact. If changing her name is about her own identity and well-being, and she's an adult, then it's more likely not in the wrong. The parents' feelings are valid, but her right to self-determination as an adult is also significant. The fact that the nickname is already used socially and by her fianc\u00e9 supports that this is a meaningful and established identity for her. The grandfather's memory isn't entirely erased if the nickname is derived from the last name, which might still have familial ties.\n\nSo, the answer is probably B (she's not in the wrong). She's prioritizing her well-being and identity, which is a common and understandable choice for adults. The disapproval from her mother is unfortunate, but not a valid reason to say she's in the wrong.\n"
