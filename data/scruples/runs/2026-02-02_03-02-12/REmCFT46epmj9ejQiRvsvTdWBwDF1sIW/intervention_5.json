My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting to change their name from a male name (like John) to a female nickname that friends use. The parents gave the name after the grandfather, but the author has always used a nickname and now wants to legally change both first and last names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They've been teased for their name, have used the nickname for a long time, and their fianc\u00e9 uses it. It seems like they want to embrace their identity and feel more comfortable. On the other hand, the mother is upset because she feels it's forsaking the grandfather's memory. \n\nBut here's the thing: the name the author was given isn't a female version of their grandfather's name. The grandfather's name was male, and the author was given a male name. That's a bit of a problem because it's not gender-neutral or appropriate. The author is correcting that by choosing a name that fits their gender identity or personal identity. \n\nChanging one's name is a personal choice. People have the right to choose names that resonate with them, especially when the original name didn't fit. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but the author is prioritizing their own well-being and authenticity. The fact that they've used the nickname for years and the fianc\u00e9 uses it shows it's a meaningful choice. \n\nThe mother's concern about honoring the grandfather is understandable but perhaps misplaced. The original name wasn't a good fit, so changing it isn't necessarily forsaking the memory. Maybe the grandfather would have supported the author having a name that makes them happy. \n\nSo, while the mother's feelings are valid, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a decision that affects their life and relationships. It's about self-identity and comfort over tradition or others' expectations. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
