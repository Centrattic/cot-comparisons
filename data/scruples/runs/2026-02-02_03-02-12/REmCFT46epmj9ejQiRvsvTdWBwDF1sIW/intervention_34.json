My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to change her name. The author was given a male name by her parents, which is a family name after her grandfather. She's been teased for it and wants to change it to a nickname that she's used and that her fianc\u00e9 uses. Her mom is upset and says she doesn't approve, thinks she's forsaking her grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The name was given with a family gesture, but it's causing her distress. She's an adult now, so personal choice is important. The mother's disapproval is a factor, but does that make the author wrong? Also, the author feels the nickname is more her identity now.\n\nIn many cultures, adults can choose their names for personal reasons. The mother's feelings are valid, but shouldn't override the daughter's well-being. The author isn't disrespecting her grandfather directly; the name change is about her own comfort. The fact that her fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname supports her sense of identity. The key here is autonomy versus family tradition. Since the author is making a choice that affects her own life, it's more about her right to self-identify. The answer is likely B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
