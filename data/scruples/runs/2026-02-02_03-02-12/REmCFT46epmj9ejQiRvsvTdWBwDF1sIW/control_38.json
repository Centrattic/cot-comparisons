My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) story is in the wrong for changing their name. The situation is that the person was given a male name (like \"John\") by their parents, which is a name after their grandfather. Now the person, who's a woman, wants to change her name to a female nickname derived from her current last name, which she's been using for years. Her mom is upset because she thinks this is forsaking the grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments for both sides. On one hand, the person is trying to align her name with her gender identity and how she's been perceived socially. She's been teased for her name, which is a valid reason for wanting to change it. Also, she's been using the nickname for a long time, so it's more of her identity now. Her fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, which shows that the change is meaningful to her relationships and personal happiness.\n\nOn the other hand, her parents named her after her grandfather, which is a meaningful family tradition. The mother's disapproval is based on feeling that changing the name disrespects the grandfather's memory. However, the person isn't erasing the grandfather entirely; she's just changing her first name. The original name was a male name given to a female, which might have caused confusion and teasing. The person's desire to have a name that fits her gender is a significant personal right.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, many people change their names for various reasons, especially if it's causing them distress. The right to self-identify and have a name that one is comfortable with is often considered a personal choice. The mother's disapproval, while hurtful, doesn't necessarily make the daughter wrong for wanting to make the change. The key here is whether the person's actions are disrespectful or if they're within their rights to make a personal choice that affects their own life.\n\nThe AITA framework often looks at whether the person is being considerate of others' feelings. The person is aware of her mother's feelings but still wants to proceed, which is a conflict of values. However, prioritizing her own well-being and social comfort over her mother's disapproval isn't inherently wrong. The mother's reaction is emotional, but unless the person is actively harming others, she's likely within her rights. So the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
