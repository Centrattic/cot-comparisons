My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name (like \"John\") to a nickname that's more gender-appropriate. The parents gave the name after the grandfather, and the mom is upset because she feels it's forsaking the grandfather's memory. The person is 21, engaged, and uses the nickname socially.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if changing one's name is a valid choice. Legally, adults can change their names, so there's no legal wrong here. The moral aspect is about respecting the parents' wishes versus personal identity and happiness. The person has been teased for the name, which affects their well-being. The nickname has been used by friends and even the fianc\u00e9, indicating it's well-established. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but the person is an adult, so their autonomy is important. \n\nThe question is about being in the wrong, not about the mother's feelings. The person isn't harming others by changing their name. It's about personal identity and comfort. So the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because it's their right to choose their identity, especially after years of social use and facing mockery. The grandfather's legacy is respected in the original name, but the new name is a personal choice for self-expression. The mother's disapproval is unfortunate, but the person isn't wrong for prioritizing their own needs and happiness.\n"
