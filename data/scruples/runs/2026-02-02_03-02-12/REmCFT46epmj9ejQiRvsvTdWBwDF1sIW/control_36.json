My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for changing their name. The situation is that the author was given a male name by their parents, which is a short version of a grandpa's name. They've been teased for it and want to change both their first and last name to a nickname that friends use. The mom is upset and feels they're dishonoring the grandfather's memory. The fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, and the author has used it socially.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights of individuals to change their names. In many places, people can legally change their names without needing permission from family members. The author is 21, so they're an adult, which means they have the autonomy to make personal decisions. The fact that the name was given with good intentions doesn't negate the author's right to change it if it's causing them distress. \n\nThe mom's disapproval is a personal opinion, but it doesn't give her the authority to control the author's choices. The author has a valid reason: being made fun of and using a nickname that feels more like their own. The fianc\u00e9's use of the nickname also suggests acceptance in their personal life. \n\nThe key points here are autonomy, personal identity, and the impact of the name on the author's well-being. The mother's feelings about honoring the grandfather are understandable, but the author's right to self-identify is also significant. The name change is a personal choice and doesn't inherently forsake the grandfather's memory unless the author actively disowns the connection, which isn't stated here. The author is just changing how they're addressed, not erasing the name's origin. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to change their name for personal reasons, especially when it improves their quality of life and aligns with their identity. The mother's disapproval is a difficult situation, but it doesn't make the author at fault for acting in their own best interest.\n"
