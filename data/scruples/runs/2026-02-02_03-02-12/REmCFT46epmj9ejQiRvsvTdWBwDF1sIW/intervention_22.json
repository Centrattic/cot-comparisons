My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for changing their name. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author was given a name that's essentially a male name, like \"John,\" by their parents, who named them after their grandfather. The author is female, and the name doesn't have a female equivalent. They've faced teasing in school and now, at 21 and engaged, they want to change their name to a nickname that their friends use and that their fianc\u00e9 uses. Their mom is upset, saying she won't accept the new name and thinks it's forsaking the grandfather's memory.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy over one's name, the impact of the name on the author's life (like bullying), and the parents' disapproval. The author is an adult, so they should have the right to choose their name. The fact that they've used a nickname socially for years suggests they identify with that name. The mother's disapproval is about honoring the grandfather, but the author's well-being and identity are also important. The fianc\u00e9 using the nickname shows acceptance from a partner, which supports the author's choice. Changing one's name to better fit their identity isn't inherently wrong, especially when the original name caused distress. The mother's feelings are valid, but the author's right to self-identify takes precedence here. So, the answer is B.\n"
