My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to change their name from a male name (like \"John\") to a female nickname that friends use. Their parents named them after their grandfather, but didn't use the female version. The individual has faced teasing and now wants to change both first and last names, especially since they're engaged and their fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname. The mom is upset, thinking they're dishonoring the grandfather.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's reasons. They've been made fun of, which is a significant issue affecting their self-esteem and social life. Choosing a name that feels more authentic and is accepted by their partner and friends seems valid. The parent's perspective is about honoring the grandfather, but the original name was never a good fit. \n\nName changes are personal and can be important for identity. Disagreeing with family doesn't necessarily mean being in the wrong. The parent's reaction is emotional, but the individual has the right to choose their identity. So the answer is B.\n"
