My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name to a female one. The original name is \"John,\" which is a boy's name, and the parents gave it as a tribute to the grandfather. The person has been teased for it, uses a nickname that friends know her by, and wants to legally change her name now that she's 21. Her mom is upset and feels she's dishonoring the grandfather.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, adults can change their names without family consent. So legally, she's allowed to do it. Then there's the personal aspect. She's been using the nickname for a long time, and her fianc\u00e9 uses that name. It's about her identity and comfort. The parents gave the name with good intentions, but she's an adult now and has the right to choose her own name. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but the daughter's autonomy is important. \n\nDisrespecting the grandfather's memory is part of the mom's concern, but continuing to use a name that causes her distress might be more disrespectful. The nickname has become her identity. So, is she in the wrong? Probably not. She's making a choice that affects her life. The mother's feelings are valid, but the daughter's right to self-identify is also valid. Since the question is about whether she's at fault, the answer would be B, No.\n"
