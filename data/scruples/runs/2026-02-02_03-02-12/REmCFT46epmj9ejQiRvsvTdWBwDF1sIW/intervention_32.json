My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person in the AITA question is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe person is a woman who was named after her grandfather, but her name is a male name like \"John.\" Her parents didn't use the female version, and now she wants to change her name to a nickname based on her current last name. She's been teased at school, and her fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname. Her mom is upset and says she's forsaking her grandfather's memory. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for changing her name despite her mom's disapproval.\n\nFirst, I should consider the main points. The person is changing her name to something that feels more like hers, especially since the original name was a male name causing her to be teased. She's 21 and engaged, so it's her adult decision. She's been using the nickname socially, and her fianc\u00e9 uses it. Her mom is upset because she feels it's disrespecting her grandfather. But the person is prioritizing her own identity and comfort over her mom's wishes.\n\nIn terms of rights, adults can legally change their names, so that's not an issue. The conflict is more about family relationships. The author might be seen as disregarding her family's feelings, but she's also standing up for her own identity. Name changes are personal, and while it's understandable the mom is hurt, the author isn't necessarily wrong for wanting to live authentically. The key here is balancing personal identity with respect for family. Since the author explains the name was a male name causing her distress, and she's using a nickname that's been accepted by friends and partner, her choice seems valid. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong).\n"
