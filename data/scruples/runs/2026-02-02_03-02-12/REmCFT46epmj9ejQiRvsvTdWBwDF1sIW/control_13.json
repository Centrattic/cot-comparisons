My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wants to change their name is in the wrong. The situation is that she was given a male name, \"John,\" by her parents, which they named after her grandfather. She's been teased for it and now wants to change her name to a nickname that friends use, which is based on her current last name. Her mom is upset and says she's forsaking her grandfather's memory. The fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the principles here. Name change is a personal choice, right? People often change names for various reasons like gender identity, cultural reasons, or just personal preference. She's been using the nickname socially for a long time, which suggests it's important to her identity. The parents gave her a name with a specific intention, but she's not rejecting the grandfather entirely\u2014she's just choosing a name she feels more comfortable with. The mother's disapproval is strong, but does that make the daughter wrong?\n\nAlso, the age factor: she's 21 and engaged, so she's an adult making her own decisions. The teasing and being made fun of in school could add to the emotional impact of keeping a name she doesn't like. The fianc\u00e9 using the nickname shows that her chosen name is accepted by others close to her.\n\nBut then, is there a cultural or familial expectation that's being ignored? The parents named her after the grandfather, which might have been a significant choice. However, the parents didn't provide a female version, so maybe they overlooked that aspect. The daughter isn't rejecting the grandfather's memory entirely; she's just changing her name to something that suits her better. The mother's reaction seems more about the name change itself rather than the daughter's well-being.\n\nIn many cases, adult children have the right to make decisions about their own names, even if it goes against family wishes. The key points here are her personal comfort, the long-term effects of teasing, and her partner's acceptance. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but the daughter's right to self-identify is important. So, the answer would be B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
