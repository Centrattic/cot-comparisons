My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for changing their name. The situation is that they were given a male name by their parents, which they don't like because it's a short name like \"John\" with no girly nickname. They were teased in school, and now they're 21 and want to legally change their name to a nickname that friends use. Their mom is upset, saying it's forsaking their grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's right to choose their name. Legally, adults can change their names as they wish, so the author has the right to do so. The parents named them after a grandparent, but maybe they didn't consider the gender aspect back then. The person is now in their early 20s, which is old enough to make such a decision. The fact that friends and fianc\u00e9 use the nickname suggests that it's a name the person identifies with more.\n\nThe mother's disapproval is hurtful, but does that make the person in the wrong? The core of the question is about whether changing the name is a valid choice despite family objections. The author isn't necessarily wrong for prioritizing their own comfort and identity over the family's feelings, especially if the name has caused them distress. However, the mother's feelings about honoring the grandfather are valid too. But ultimately, the right to self-identify one's name is a personal choice. So the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
