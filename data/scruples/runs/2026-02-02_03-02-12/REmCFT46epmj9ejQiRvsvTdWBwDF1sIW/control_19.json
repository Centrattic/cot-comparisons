My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to change their name. The author's name is a male name, \"John,\" given by parents who were honoring their grandfather. The author is female and has been teased for it, and now wants to change both her first and last name to a nickname based on her current last name. Her mom is upset and says she won't accept the new name, thinking it's forsaking her grandfather's memory.\n\nHmm, so first, the author has a right to choose their name, right? Like, in many places, adults can legally change their names if they want. The parents gave her the name, but she's 21 now and an adult. The fact that she's been using a nickname for a long time and her fianc\u00e9 uses it suggests it's important to her identity. The teasing she's faced is a valid reason for wanting the change. But her mom is upset about honoring the grandfather. \n\nI think the key points are autonomy and identity versus family tradition. The author is making a choice that affects her own life, and being teased is a significant issue. While the grandfather's memory is important, adults can make decisions that prioritize their own well-being. The parents might feel hurt, but the author isn't wrong for prioritizing her own comfort and identity. So I think the answer is B, No.\n"
