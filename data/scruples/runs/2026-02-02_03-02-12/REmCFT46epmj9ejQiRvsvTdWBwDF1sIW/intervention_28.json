My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name (like \"John\") to a nickname that they've used socially. The parents named them after the grandfather, but there's no female version, leading to teasing. The author wants to change both first and last names, and the mom is upset because she thinks it's forsaking the grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons the author has. They've been teased at school, which is a significant issue. Using a name that aligns more with their identity and how others see them (since they're a girl) makes sense. The name change is also about personal identity and comfort, which is a valid reason. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname suggests it's a name they're comfortable with and are recognized by in their social circle.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents' perspective is about honoring the grandfather. But the author isn't erasing the grandfather's name entirely\u2014they're changing their own name. The original name was a male name without a female equivalent, so expecting the author to keep a name that doesn't fit their gender might be unfair. The parents' disapproval and potential anger are hurtful, but the author's right to self-identify seems more important here.\n\nLegally and socially, people have the right to change their names for various reasons, including personal identity. The author isn't causing harm by changing their name; they're seeking to align their legal identity with how they've always been known. The mother's reaction might stem from tradition or feeling the name is a legacy, but the author's well-being and personal identity should take precedence.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a valid reason to change their name, and their choice is about personal identity and comfort, which is a strong justification. The parents' feelings are important, but the author's autonomy is key here.\n"
