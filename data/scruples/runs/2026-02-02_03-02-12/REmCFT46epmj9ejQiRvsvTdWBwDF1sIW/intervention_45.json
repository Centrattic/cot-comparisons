My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wants to change their name is in the wrong. The situation is that they were given a male name (like John) by their parents, which was actually named after their grandfather. Now they want to change both their first and last name to a nickname that friends have used. Their mom is against it, saying she won't accept the new name and thinks they're forsaking their grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's reasoning. They mention being made fun of throughout school, which is a significant issue. Having a name that doesn't fit one's gender identity or that leads to bullying can affect someone's mental health and social life. They also mention that they've used the nickname for a long time, even with their fianc\u00e9, so it feels more like their real name now. That suggests it's important to their identity.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents named them after the grandfather, which was a meaningful gesture. The mother's disapproval is based on respecting her husband's memory and possibly seeing the name change as disrespectful. However, the person is now an adult, 21 and engaged, so they have the legal right to change their name. The question is whether they're in the wrong for doing so despite the mother's objections.\n\nLegally, adults can change their names without family approval. The emotional aspect is tricky. The mother feels it's disrespectful, but the person is making a choice that's important to their self-identity and well-being. The key points are autonomy, the impact of the name on their life, and respecting the family's wishes. While the mother's feelings are valid, the person's right to self-identify and their well-being might outweigh the mother's disapproval. So the answer would likely be B, not in the wrong.\n"
