My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to change their name from a male name (like John) to a nickname that's more feminine. The parents named them after the grandfather, but the author is a girl and the name isn't the female version. They've been teased for it, and now they want to change both their first and last name to a nickname that friends use. The mom is upset, saying she doesn't approve and thinks it's forsaking the grandfather's memory. The author is 21 and engaged, and their fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname.\n\nHmm. Well, name changes are a personal choice, especially when someone wants to use a name that feels more authentic to them. The author mentions being teased in school, which probably affected their self-esteem. The name was given with a family tradition in mind, but if it's causing distress and the person wants to change it, that's their right. The parents' disapproval is tough, but the author is an adult now. Legally, they can change their name if they want. Emotionally, the mom is upset about the grandfather's memory, but the author is using a nickname that's already been associated with them. It's more about their identity and comfort now. The fianc\u00e9 using the nickname supports that it's a name they identify with. So, I think the author isn't in the wrong. They have every right to choose a name that makes them feel good and fits their identity, even if it goes against family expectations.\n"
