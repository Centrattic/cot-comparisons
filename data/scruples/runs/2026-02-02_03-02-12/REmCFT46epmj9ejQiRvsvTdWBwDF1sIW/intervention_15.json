My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for changing their name. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The person is a woman who has a male name, which was given to her by her parents in honor of her grandfather. The name is like \"John,\" which doesn't have a common feminine variation. She's been teased for it, and now that she's 21 and engaged, she wants to legally change both her first and last names. Her mom is against it, saying she doesn't want to accept the new name and thinks she's dishonoring her grandfather. The author's fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname she's considering, and friends have always used that nickname too.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspect. In most places, adults can legally change their names without needing permission from family members. So from a legal standpoint, she's allowed to do this. But the question is about being in the wrong morally or socially, not legally.\n\nThe parents named her after her grandfather, which is a meaningful gesture. However, the name causes her distress and has been a source of teasing. She's been using a nickname for a long time, which makes it feel like her real name now. The fianc\u00e9's support is also a factor here. When someone is in a committed relationship, their opinion and comfort can be significant.\n\nThe mother's disapproval is strong, but does that make the author wrong? Well, family traditions and honoring ancestors are important, but individual identity and personal happiness are also crucial. If the name has been a source of ongoing distress and she's found a way to reclaim her identity through a name change, that seems valid. The mother's feelings are important, but they shouldn't override the daughter's well-being unless there's some cultural or religious reason that's binding. The question doesn't mention such factors.\n\nAnother angle: the nickname is based on her current last name. So changing both first and last names might complicate things, but it's her choice. She's an adult, so the decision is hers to make. The mother's disapproval might cause family tension, but the author has to weigh that against her own happiness. Also, the fianc\u00e9 using the nickname suggests that her new family (or partner's family) will accept this name, which could help her feel more comfortable.\n\nIn many cases, people change their names for various reasons\u2014like wanting to honor someone else, gender identity, or simply preferring a different name. The key here is that she's not denying her family's influence but rather creating a name that feels authentic to her. The grandfather's memory is honored through her original name, but she's taking steps to have a name that aligns with her identity now.\n\nI think the main factors are her well-being, the support from her fianc\u00e9, and her own sense of identity. The mother's feelings are a concern, but they shouldn't dictate what the adult daughter does with her own life. So I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong. She's making a choice that's right for her, even if it upsets her mother.\n"
