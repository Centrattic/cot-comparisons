I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person is in the wrong for wanting to change their name. Let me start by reading the situation again.\n\nThe person is a girl who was given a male name, \"John,\" after her grandfather. The name isn't a female version and has no girly nickname. She's been teased about it in school. Now that she's 21 and engaged, she wants to change both her first and last name to a nickname based on her current last name that friends use. Her mom doesn't approve, says she'd never accept the new name, and thinks she's forsaking her grandfather's memory. The author is asking if she's in the wrong to proceed despite her mom's disapproval.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspect. In many places, adults can legally change their names once they're of age. Since she's 21, she's an adult and has the right to change her name. That's a basic right, so from a legal standpoint, she's not in the wrong.\n\nEmotionally, her mom is upset because she feels the name connects to her grandfather. The author likes the gesture but was given a name that doesn't fit her gender. She's been teased, which is a valid reason for wanting to change. Her fianc\u00e9 and friends already use the nickname, which suggests it's a name she's been associated with for a long time. Changing her name to something she identifies with more might be important for her self-esteem and personal identity.\n\nThe mom's disapproval is hurtful, but the author is an adult. While respecting her family's feelings is important, she has the autonomy to make decisions about her own life. The conflict here is between her personal identity and her family's expectations. In such cases, personal autonomy usually takes precedence once someone is an adult.\n\nHowever, maybe there's a middle ground. Did the author consider discussing this with her family to find a compromise? The scenario doesn't mention that she tried to explain her reasons beyond bringing it up. But even if she hasn't, her right to change her name still stands. The mom's disapproval doesn't negate the author's right to self-identify.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong). She has the legal right to change her name, and personal identity and comfort are significant factors. The mom's feelings are valid, but the author's autonomy is key here.\n"
