My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to change their name from a male name (like \"John\") to a female nickname. The parents named them after their grandfather, which the user likes the gesture but the name doesn't have a female equivalent. They've been teased at school, and now they're 21 and engaged, wanting to legally change both first and last names.\n\nThe mom is upset and thinks they're dishonoring the grandfather. The user has always used the nickname socially, even their fianc\u00e9 uses it. The core issue is about personal identity versus family tradition.\n\nLegally, in the US, adults can change their names for any reason, so there's no legal wrong. The parents' disapproval is emotional, but the user isn't doing anything illegal. The key points are autonomy, personal comfort, and the impact of teasing. The user has a right to their own identity, especially when the name is causing distress. The grandfather's honor is something the parents value, but the user isn't disrespecting him; they just want a name that fits better. The parents' reaction is about their feelings, not the user's rights. So the answer is B, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
