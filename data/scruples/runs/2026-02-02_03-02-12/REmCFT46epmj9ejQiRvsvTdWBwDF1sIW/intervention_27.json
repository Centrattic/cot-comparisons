My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name to a female one, which is a nickname based on their last name. The author's parents, especially the mom, are upset because the original name was after the grandpa, and the mom feels it's forsaking his memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The name was given by parents, but the author has been teased for it. They've used a nickname since school, and the fianc\u00e9 uses that. The mom is disapproving, but the author is an adult now, 21 and engaged. Legally, adults can change their names without others' consent in many places, so that's a factor. The name change is about personal identity and comfort, which is a valid reason. The parents' emotional stance is important, but the author's well-being and autonomy should matter. The fact that the nickname is already used by friends and the fianc\u00e9 shows it's a natural extension of their identity. The mom's disapproval might be hurtful, but the author isn't wrong for prioritizing their own identity. So, the answer is B.\n"
