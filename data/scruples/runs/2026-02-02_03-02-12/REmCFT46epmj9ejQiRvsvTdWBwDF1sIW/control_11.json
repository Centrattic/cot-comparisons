My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So, the person is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their name from a male name to a female one. Their parents named them after their grandfather, which is a boy's name. They've been teased for it and are changing their name to a nickname they've used. Their mom is upset, thinking they're dishonoring their grandfather. The fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname.\n\nFirst, I need to consider name changing rights. In many places, adults can legally change their names. So from a legal standpoint, it's their right. The person is 21, so they're an adult. They mention the nickname they use is already known by friends and their fianc\u00e9, so maybe it's about self-identity and personal comfort.\n\nThe mother's disapproval is about honoring the grandfather, but the person feels the original name isn't suitable for them. They're not erasing the grandfather's name entirely\u2014they\u2019re just changing their own. The mother's emotional reaction is understandable, but the person is making a choice that affects their own life. The key here is the balance between respecting family tradition and personal identity. Since the person is an adult, the decision is theirs to make, even if it upsets family. So, they're not in the wrong.\n"
