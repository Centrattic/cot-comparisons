My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for wanting to change their name. The situation is that the person was given a male name (like \"John\") by their parents, which they've been teased for in school. Now at 21 and engaged, they want to change both their first and last names to a nickname based on their current last name, which friends have used. Their mom is upset, thinking they're forsaking their grandfather's memory, and says she won't accept the new name. The person is considering going through with the change despite this.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the key points here. The person is an adult, 21 years old, which is of age in most places. They're changing their name for personal reasons\u2014comfort, identity, and to avoid being teased. The parents named them after their grandfather, but didn't do a female version, which the person likes the gesture but the actual name is a male one. The nickname has been used by friends and even their fianc\u00e9, making it feel more like their own name. The conflict is with the mother's disapproval, but the person is still considering changing their legal name.\n\nNow, considering the ethical standpoint. Name changing is a personal right. In many cultures, especially in Western ones, adults have the legal right to change their names. The person is using a nickname that's been accepted by their peers and partner, which suggests that the new name is significant to their identity. The mother's disapproval is based on familial tradition and honoring the grandfather, but the person is within their rights to change their name if they choose.\n\nIs the person being disrespectful? The mother feels that changing the name is forsaking the grandfather's memory. However, the person is acknowledging the gesture of being named after the grandfather but is choosing a name that better suits their identity. It's possible that the mother's reaction stems from emotional attachment to the name, but the person isn't necessarily disrespectful if they're making this decision to better their own life and well-being.\n\nThe key factors here are autonomy and respect. The person has the autonomy to choose their name as an adult. The mother's disapproval is valid in terms of her feelings, but the person isn't obligated to keep a name that causes them distress. The act of changing the name isn't inherently disrespectful unless done with malice, which isn't indicated here. The person is seeking to align their legal name with how they've been known socially, which is a common reason for name changes.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the person isn't in the wrong. They're making a decision that affects their own life, and while family feelings are important, their autonomy and personal comfort should be respected. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
