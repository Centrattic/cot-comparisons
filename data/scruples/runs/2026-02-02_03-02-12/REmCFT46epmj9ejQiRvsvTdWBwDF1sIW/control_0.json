My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name given by their parents to a nickname they prefer. The parents named them after the grandfather, which the author likes the gesture but the name is a male name without a female version. They've been teased for it and now want to change their first and last name to the nickname their friends use. The mom is upset, saying the author is forsaking the grandfather's memory and refuses to accept the new name.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments on both sides. The author's reasoning is that they've always used the nickname, it's more comfortable, and they want to use their fianc\u00e9's name. They might feel that the original name doesn't fit their identity. On the other hand, the parents see it as rejecting their family's tradition and honoring the grandfather. The mother's disapproval adds emotional weight.\n\nBut in terms of right or wrong, it's about personal autonomy. People have the legal right to change their names. The author is 21, so they're an adult. The parents can be upset, but the decision is the author's to make. The mother's reaction is about her feelings, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing their own comfort and identity. The key points are the long-standing teasing, personal identity, and being an adult making their own choices. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). The mother's feelings are valid, but the author isn't wrong to choose their preferred name.\n"
