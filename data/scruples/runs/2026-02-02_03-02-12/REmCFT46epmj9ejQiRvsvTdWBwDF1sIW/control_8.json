My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The question is whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting to change their name from a male name (like John) to a female nickname based on their last name. Their parents named them after their grandfather, but they feel the name isn't suitable for them as a girl and have been teased for it. They want to use a nickname that friends use, which their future husband also uses, and are considering changing both their first and last names. Their mom is upset, saying she won't accept the new name and thinks they're honoring their grandfather by using his name.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's perspective. They're an adult, 21 years old, which is of legal age to make decisions. They've been teased for their name, which can be really hard on someone's self-esteem. Using a nickname that's more gender-aligned could help them feel more comfortable and accepted. The fact that their fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname suggests that they're serious about this change and it's part of their identity now.\n\nOn the other hand, their mother feels that changing the name is dishonoring their grandfather. The parents' intention behind the original name is important to them. The mother's disapproval and potential anger are real issues here. But does that make the person in the wrong?\n\nIn many cultures, people can choose to change their names once they're adults, especially if the name is causing them distress. It's their right to choose how they present themselves. The mother's feelings are valid, but the person's autonomy and well-being might be more critical. The nickname being used as a first name might not be a direct replacement for the grandfather's name, but rather a way to honor their own identity.\n\nHowever, there's a balance between respecting family legacy and personal identity. The person isn't rejecting the grandfather entirely\u2014they're just changing their name. It's possible that the mother's reaction is more about the name itself rather than the act of changing it. The person is also changing their last name, which might be part of a broader life decision, like marriage, so that's a personal choice too.\n\nI think the key factors here are the person's age (adult), their right to self-identify, the impact of the name on their life, and the fact that they're making a permanent change as part of their identity. The mother's feelings are important, but the person isn't necessarily wrong for prioritizing their own comfort and identity. So the answer is probably B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
