My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name given by their parents to a nickname that's more aligned with their identity.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person was given a name originally meant for a boy, named after their grandfather. The name isn't a female version, and it's a short male name with no girly nickname. They've faced teasing for it and now, at 21 and engaged, want to legally change both their first and last names. The nickname they've used is based on their current last name. Their mom is upset, thinking they're dishonoring their grandfather. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. So, is changing one's name after reaching adulthood a personal choice that others can't control? Legally, once you're an adult, you can change your name if you want. The parents gave the name, but that doesn't mean the person can't choose a different name later. The key points here are autonomy, personal identity, and the impact on the family's feelings.\n\nHowever, the mother's reaction is about respecting the grandfather's memory. But the author has been using the nickname for a long time, which suggests it's been part of their identity. The fianc\u00e9 also uses the nickname, so it's integrated into their personal and social life. The mother's disapproval might be valid in terms of her feelings, but it's not a legal or moral obligation to keep the original name.\n\nI should consider cultural perspectives too. In some cultures, family names are very important, and changing them could be seen as disrespectful. But the question is more about whether the author is in the wrong, not cultural norms. Since the author is an adult, the decision is their own. The mother's feelings are hurt, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is at fault. They're making a choice that affects their own life and relationships, not forcing others to feel a certain way.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The person has the right to choose their own name, especially if it's causing distress and they've been using the new name socially for a while. The mother's disapproval is a consequence of the author's decision, but the author isn't obligated to keep a name that doesn't fit their identity for the sake of others' feelings.\n"
