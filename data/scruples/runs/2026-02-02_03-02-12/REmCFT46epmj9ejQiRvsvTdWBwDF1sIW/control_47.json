My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to change their name from a male name given by their parents to their nickname. The parents named them after the grandfather, but the name is a short male name with no girly nickname. The person has been teased about it and is 21 now.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about identity and autonomy. The person wants to use a nickname that feels more like their identity now. They're changing both first and last names to align with how they've been known for years. The mother is upset, thinking it disrespects the grandfather, but the person feels the current name isn't theirs.\n\nLegally, adults can change their names for any reason, so the author isn't breaking the law. The parents' disapproval is emotional, but that doesn't make the author wrong. The question is more about personal choice versus family expectations. The person's happiness and self-identification are important, especially since they've used the nickname in social settings and their fianc\u00e9 uses it too. The parents' feelings are valid, but the author has the right to choose their own name. So, the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
