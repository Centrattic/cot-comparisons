My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to legally change their name away from the one their parents gave them, which is a male name. Their parents named them after the grandfather, but there's no female version, leading to bullying. Now they're 21, engaged, and want to switch to a nickname that friends use, which is a female name. The mom is upset, saying it's forsaking the grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the individual's rights. In many places, adults can legally change their names for personal reasons. The author is an adult, so it's their choice. The fact that they've been bullied for the name is a valid reason for wanting a change. Also, using a nickname that feels more like their identity makes sense, especially if it's been used socially for a long time. The fianc\u00e9 using the nickname supports that the new name is part of their identity now.\n\nHowever, the parents' feelings are important too. The name was chosen to honor a grandfather, and the mother feels the change is disrespectful. But the author's well-being and personal identity might outweigh the parents' disapproval. The key here is that the decision is the individual's to make, especially when it's about their comfort and how they're perceived by others.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're prioritizing their own identity and the emotional impact of being bullied. The mother's disapproval is understandable but not a valid reason to stop the name change. So the answer should be B.\n"
