My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name to a female one. The situation is that they were named after their grandfather, but the name is a short male name like John. They've been teased, are 21 and engaged, and want to change their name to a nickname that friends use. Their mom is upset and thinks they're dishonoring the grandfather.\n\nFirst, I need to consider name change laws. In many places, adults can legally change their names without family consent as long as they're not using it for fraudulent purposes. So legally, the person is probably within their rights.\n\nNext, the emotional aspect. The person has been made fun of, which is a valid reason for wanting a name change. Using a nickname that friends already know them by could help with their self-esteem and social interactions. The fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, indicating acceptance in their personal life.\n\nThe mother's disapproval is about honoring the grandfather. But the person is choosing a nickname derived from their last name, not directly changing the first name to something unrelated. They still respect the original name's significance but want to use a name that feels more authentic to them now.\n\nCultural and family traditions vary. While the parents named them after a grandparent, the individual's right to self-identify is important. At 21, they're an adult, so their autonomy should be respected.\n\nThe key points are the person's well-being, legal rights, and the social context. The mother's feelings are valid, but they shouldn't override the individual's right to choose their own identity. The nickname is already established in their social circle, so changing the legal name to match that would align their legal identity with how they're known.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They have a valid reason, legal right, and the change aligns with their personal identity and social use.\n"
