My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their name from a male name given by their parents to a nickname they've used since school. Their parents named them after their grandfather, a boy's name, and the person has faced teasing because of it. Now they want to legally change both their first and last names to a nickname derived from their current last name. The mom is upset, saying she won't accept the new name and feels they're forgetting their grandfather. The fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname.\n\nSo, the key points here are the person's right to choose their own name, the impact of the name on their life (bullying, identity), and the parents' disapproval. Legally, in many places, you can change your name as an adult, so the person is within their rights. The parents disapproving is their own feelings, but that doesn't make the person in the wrong. The person is trying to live as their true self, which is important for mental health and well-being. The fact that they've used the nickname for so long and the fianc\u00e9 uses it shows it's a part of their identity. The parents might feel hurt, but the person isn't wrong for prioritizing their own comfort and identity over the parents' approval. The answer is probably B, not in the wrong.\n"
