My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name (like John) to a nickname based on their last name, especially since their parents named them after their grandfather. The parents don't approve and think it's forsaking their grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's perspective. They've been teased throughout school, which is a significant issue. At 21, they're an adult, and changing their name is a personal choice. They've used the nickname socially and their fianc\u00e9 uses it too. It seems like this change would make them more comfortable and align with their identity.\n\nOn the flip side, the parents feel the original name was a tribute to their grandfather. The mother's reaction is strong, thinking the person is dishonoring the grandfather's memory. There's a cultural or familial aspect here\u2014naming traditions can be important in some families. But does that outweigh the individual's right to self-identify?\n\nLegally, adults can change their names, so there's no legal wrongdoing here. Ethically, it's about personal autonomy versus family tradition. The person has the right to choose their own name, especially if it affects their well-being. The parents' disapproval is hurtful, but the person's happiness and comfort might be more important. Also, the fianc\u00e9 using the nickname suggests social acceptance beyond just the family.\n\nI think the key points are the individual's right to self-identify, the impact of bullying, and the adult's autonomy. The parents' feelings are valid, but the person isn't wrong for prioritizing their own comfort and identity. So the answer should be B, not in the wrong.\n"
