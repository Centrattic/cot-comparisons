My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their name from a male name to a female one. Their parents named them after their grandfather, but it's a male name without a female equivalent. The name has been a source of teasing, and they've used a nickname for years. Now they're 21, engaged, and want to legally change both their first and last names. Their mom is upset, saying it's forsaking their grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's rights. In most places, adults can legally change their names for any reason, as long as it's not for fraudulent purposes. So that's a point in their favor. They're an adult, so they have autonomy over their identity. The fact that they've been teased for their name and have used a nickname for years suggests that the name isn't serving them well and that changing it could improve their well-being.\n\nThe parents' objection is about honoring the grandfather. But the person's argument is that they appreciate the gesture but want a name that feels more authentic to them. It's a balance between respecting family history and personal identity. Since they\u2019re an adult, their right to self-identify is important. Also, their fianc\u00e9 and friends already use the nickname, which shows social acceptance of the new name.\n\nThe mother's disapproval might stem from emotional attachment to the grandfather's legacy. However, the person isn't erasing the grandfather; the new name is based on their last name, which still ties them to their family. The key here is that the person is seeking to align their name with their identity and comfort, which is valid. The mother's feelings are important, but they shouldn't override the individual's autonomy once they\u2019re an adult.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because they're making a personal choice that affects their own life, and they have the right to change their name as an adult.\n"
