My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for changing their name. The situation is that the author was given a male name (like John) by their parents, which was meant to honor their grandfather. However, the author is a girl and wants to change her name to a nickname derived from her current last name, which she's used in social settings. Her mom is upset and thinks she's dishonoring her grandfather. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for proceeding with the name change despite her mom's disapproval.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The person has been made fun of for their name throughout school, which is a significant emotional impact. They're now 21 and engaged, wanting to change their name to something they feel is more authentic. The nickname they want to use is already how friends know them, and their fianc\u00e9 also uses it. The parents gave a name with a specific intention (honoring a grandparent), but the name isn't gendered as intended, leading to distress.\n\nThe author's right to self-identify is a big factor here. People often change their names for various reasons, including personal identity and comfort. The fact that the name caused bullying and ongoing distress adds weight to the argument that changing it is reasonable. The mother's disapproval is based on honoring the grandfather, but the author is trying to reconcile that by using a nickname derived from the last name, which might still honor the family in some way. The grandfather was likely honored through the name choice, but the execution didn't align with the author's identity.\n\nAlso, the author is an adult now, so the decision to change their name is a personal one, not subject to parental approval. The mother's reaction is emotional, but the author's well-being and self-expression are important. While respecting family traditions is valuable, an adult's autonomy in such matters usually takes precedence. The fact that the nickname is already in use and accepted by friends and partner suggests it's a natural extension of her identity.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a choice that aligns with their identity and well-being, which is a valid reason for a name change. The mother's feelings are important, but the author isn't obligated to maintain a name that causes them distress. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
