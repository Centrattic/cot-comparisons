My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to change their name from a male name (like John) to a nickname based on their last name. The parents named them after their grandfather, but the name is a boy's name with no female equivalent. The author has been teased in school and now wants to change both first and last names to their nickname. The mom is upset and says she won't accept the new name, thinking it's forsaking the grandfather's memory. The author is 21 and engaged, with the fianc\u00e9 using the nickname.\n\nFirst, the author's right to self-identify. Names are personal, and changing a name is a common practice for various reasons, including personal identity, comfort, and to avoid discrimination. The fact that the name was given with a gesture (honoring the grandfather) doesn't negate the person's right to change it if it's causing them distress. The nickname has been used by friends and family, which suggests it's a natural extension of their identity. The fianc\u00e9 using the nickname shows acceptance from their partner, which is important for their personal life and future family dynamics.\n\nThe parents' disapproval is hurtful, but their feelings don't override the author's well-being. The mother's belief that changing the name is forsaking the grandfather might stem from tradition, but the author is not rejecting the grandfather's memory entirely\u2014they're just adopting a name that feels more authentic. The key points here are autonomy, the impact on the author's life, and the support from their partner. The author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical; they're making a personal choice that affects their own life. The mother's disapproval is valid in terms of her feelings, but it doesn't make the author wrong for changing their name. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
