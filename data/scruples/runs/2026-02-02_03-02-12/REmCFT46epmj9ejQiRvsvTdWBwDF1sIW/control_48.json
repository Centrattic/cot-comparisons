My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for changing their name. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person is a girl named \"John,\" which is a male name given by her parents as a tribute to her grandfather. She's being teased for it throughout school and now, at 21 and engaged, wants to legally change both her first and last name to a nickname based on her current last name that friends use. Her mom is upset, saying she doesn't approve and thinks she's forsaking her grandfather's memory. The question is whether she's in the wrong for wanting to do this despite her mom's disapproval.\n\nFirst, let's consider the rights of the individual. In many places, adults have the legal right to change their names. The person is 21, so they're an adult. Changing one's name is a personal choice, especially if it affects their well-being. Being teased for a name that doesn't fit one's gender identity or personal identity can be hurtful. Even if the name was given with good intentions, the person has the right to choose a name that makes them feel comfortable and authentic.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents gave her the name as a tribute to the grandfather. The mother feels that changing the name is forsaking that memory. But does the name itself have inherent value beyond the person's identity? The person mentions that the nickname is already used by friends and even her fianc\u00e9. It seems like the nickname is something that represents her more accurately in social contexts, so aligning her legal name with that could be seen as a positive step for her self-identity and happiness.\n\nAnother angle: respect for family. The mother is upset, and the person might be causing emotional pain. But the person's well-being is also important. There's a balance between honoring family traditions and respecting individual autonomy. Since she's an adult, her autonomy might take precedence here. The parents gave her the name at birth, but as an adult, she's making a choice about her own identity.\n\nThe father's perspective isn't mentioned, but the mother's disapproval is. However, the person isn't seeking their approval, just wanting to proceed with the change. The fianc\u00e9 supports the nickname, which adds to the idea that this name is part of her established identity.\n\nPotential arguments against the person: maybe she should have considered the family's feelings more. But again, she's making a personal decision that affects her directly. The mother's feelings are important, but they shouldn't override the individual's right to self-identify.\n\nIn many cultures, name changes are common for personal reasons, especially if the original name doesn't suit the person. The grandfather's memory is tied to the name, but the person is not erasing the grandfather; she's choosing a different name for herself. The tribute was given through the name, but she's not rejecting that tribute by changing her name\u2014she's just redefining her own identity.\n\nSo, considering all this, the person isn't in the wrong. She's an adult with the right to choose her own name for her own reasons. The mother's disapproval is unfortunate, but the person isn't obligated to seek her approval.\n"
