My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wants to change their name is in the wrong. The situation is that their parents gave them a male name, which they've been teased for. They want to change both their first and last name to a nickname they've used, which is based on their last name. Their mom is upset, saying it's forsaking her grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's right to choose their name. In many places, people can legally change their names as adults, especially if it's for personal reasons like being teased. The fact that they've been using the nickname socially and their fianc\u00e9 uses it suggests it's part of their identity now. The parents might feel hurt because the name was a tribute to the grandfather, but the person is an adult and has the autonomy to make this choice. However, there's also the emotional aspect of family dynamics. The mother's reaction could be about feeling disrespected or that the child isn't honoring the grandfather's legacy. \n\nBut balancing that, the person is dealing with years of bullying and wants to feel comfortable in their own skin, especially for their marriage. They're not erasing the grandfather entirely; the original name still exists, just not as their legal one. The mother's disapproval might be hard, but it's the adult child's life. So the answer probably leans towards the person not being in the wrong. They have a valid reason for wanting to change their name, even if it upsets their parent. The key points are autonomy, personal identity, and the impact of bullying versus honoring family history.\n"
