My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to change their name. The person was given a male name by their parents, which they didn't like, faced teasing, and now wants to change both their first and last name. Their mom is against it, saying it's forsaking their grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The name was given by parents, but it's causing the person distress. They've been teased for years, and now they're an adult with a fianc\u00e9 who uses the nickname. The mother disapproves and would be mad. The main question is whether the person is in the wrong by going ahead with the name change despite the mother's disapproval.\n\nIn terms of rights, adults generally have the right to choose their names. The fact that the name was given by parents doesn't mean the person can't change it later, especially if it's causing them harm. The mother's feelings are important, but they shouldn't override the individual's right to self-identity. The person has been using the nickname for a long time, which suggests it's a significant part of their identity now. The fianc\u00e9 using the nickname also supports that this is their chosen identity. \n\nHowever, the mother feels it's disrespecting her father (the grandfather). This is a clash between family tradition and the individual's needs. But the person isn't rejecting the grandfather's memory entirely; they just want to change their name. The mother's disapproval is strong, but that doesn't make the person wrong. It's more about their autonomy versus family expectations. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the person isn't in the wrong. They have the right to change their name, especially after years of being teased and preferring a different identity. The mother's feelings are valid, but the individual's right to self-determination takes precedence here.\n"
