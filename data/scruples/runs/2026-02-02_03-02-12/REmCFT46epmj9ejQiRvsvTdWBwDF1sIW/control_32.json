My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a woman who wants to change her name from a male one (like John) to a nickname based on her last name. Her parents gave her a name after her grandfather, but didn't use the female version. She's been teased for her name, and now she's 21 and engaged. She wants to use a nickname that's already common among friends and her fianc\u00e9. Her mom is upset, thinking it's forsaking her grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, the key points: She's an adult, so she has the legal right to change her name. The name issue is affecting her socially, causing teasing. The nickname is already in use, so this change is more about authenticity. The mom's disapproval is based on family tradition and honor. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, changing one's name as an adult is a personal choice. The parents have their reasons, but the individual's well-being and comfort should matter. The name she wants to use is her identity now. The fact that her fianc\u00e9 uses it shows acceptance. The mother's stance is about tradition, but the daughter's happiness is also important. There's no malice in her wanting to change the name. So, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
