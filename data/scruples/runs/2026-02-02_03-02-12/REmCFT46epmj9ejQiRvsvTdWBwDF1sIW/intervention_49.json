My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to change their name from a traditionally male name to a female nickname that their friends use. The parents gave the name as a tribute to the grandfather, but the author has been teased for it and wants to use a nickname instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is an adult, 21 and engaged, so they have autonomy over their own choices. The name given by parents was a male name, which might not fit the author's identity, especially since they're female. The fact that friends and the partner use the nickname suggests that the name is already associated with them in their social circles. The parents disapprove, but their argument is about honoring the grandfather. \n\nLegally, adults can change their names without needing permission. The emotional aspect is important too\u2014being teased at school is a valid reason for wanting a change. The parents' feelings are significant, but the author's well-being and personal identity come into play here. Respecting one's own identity is crucial, and changing a name is a personal choice that shouldn't be forced upon someone against their will. \n\nThe parents might feel hurt, but the author isn't wrong for prioritizing their own comfort and identity. The grandfather's memory is important, but the author isn't erasing it; they're choosing a name that feels more authentic to them. The nickname is derived from the last name, so it's a creative way to keep a connection while changing the first name. \n\nIn summary, the author's decision is about self-identity and well-being, which should take precedence over parental disapproval, even if it causes some family tension. So the answer is B, they are not in the wrong.\n"
