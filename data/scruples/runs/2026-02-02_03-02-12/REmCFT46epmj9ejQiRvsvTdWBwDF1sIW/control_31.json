My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name to a female one, given their parents' disapproval. The name was given in honor of their grandfather, but it's causing them issues.\n\nFirst, the person is 21 and engaged, so they're an adult now. They've been using a nickname all along, and their fianc\u00e9 uses that name. That suggests they've been living with this nickname for a while, which probably makes it feel more like their real name. The parents are upset because they think the name is a tribute to the grandfather, but the author isn't using the female version. However, the author isn't rejecting the grandfather's memory entirely\u2014they just want to use the nickname that's been accepted by friends and family in social settings.\n\nThe parents' disapproval is strong, but the author is an adult with the legal right to change their name. The key points here are autonomy and identity. The name change is about the author's comfort and self-identity, not just about being rebellious. They've faced teasing at school, which adds to the motivation. While the parents' feelings are valid, the author's right to choose their own name, especially when it's been their social name for years, seems important. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname also supports that this is a settled choice.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're making a decision that affects their own life and happiness. The parents' disapproval is hurtful, but the author's autonomy as an adult should take precedence.\n"
