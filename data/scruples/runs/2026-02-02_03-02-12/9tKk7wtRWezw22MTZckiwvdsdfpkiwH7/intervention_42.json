We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he brought a concealed gun to their house.\n\nFirst, the situation: The group used to meet at a shop but now at the author's house. Jim has a concealed carry permit and usually carries a gun. The author told him privately not to bring the gun to their house. Jim didn't confirm but later, when the author wasn't around, Jim told another member he still had his gun. The author then told Jim not to come back if he's armed. Jim left the group. The group's reactions are mixed.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author is the host of the house. They set a rule beforehand. Jim didn't follow it. The author enforced their rule. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, it's their house, so they can set the rules. They made it clear no guns. Jim brought his anyway, so the author kicked him out. That seems reasonable. But some might argue that Jim has a right to carry and that the author is being too strict. However, in private property, the owner can set rules. Even if Jim is legally allowed to carry in public, the author can restrict it on their property. So the author isn't violating any laws by doing so.\n\nAlso, the author's concern is about safety. Gun laws vary, but in terms of personal comfort and security, it's valid. The author made their stance clear. Jim chose to ignore the rule, leading to the author taking action. Since the author communicated the rule and Jim didn't comply, the action was justified.\n\nThe responses from the group are split, but that's common in such scenarios. The author's decision is based on their own home's rules, which is their right. So the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
