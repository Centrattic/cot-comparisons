We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a board game group where one member, Jim, carries a concealed gun and was asked to leave the group's meet-up at the author's house because of that.\n\nFirst, the author is hosting the game nights at their home now, which is a personal space. They had already privately told Jim that no guns were allowed in the house and asked him to leave his in his truck. But during the first session, Jim still had the gun on him when the author was in the kitchen. The author then kicked him out, and Jim quit the group.\n\nThe author's stance is that it's their house and their rules. They mention being anti-gun but had never brought it up before. The other group members have mixed reactions, with some agreeing and others not. \n\nFrom a legal perspective, in many places, even with a concealed carry permit, a homeowner can enforce their own rules regarding guns on their property. So the author has the right to set boundaries in their home. However, some might argue that Jim was clear about his intention to carry and the author might have known that upfront, yet still allowed him to join the group. But the key point is that the author communicated their rule before the event and then followed through when it was broken, which is their right as a host.\n\nThe author did give a warning beforehand, so it's not like they ambushed Jim. The fact that he didn't comply after being asked is on him. The author's action was to protect their personal space, which is a valid reason. The other members' mixed reactions don't necessarily make the author wrong; people have different opinions on guns. The main issue here is the homeowner's authority to set their own rules. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
