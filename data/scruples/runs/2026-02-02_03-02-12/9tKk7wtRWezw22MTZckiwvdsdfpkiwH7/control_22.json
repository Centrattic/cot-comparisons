We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a board game group where one member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and brings his gun to the game night at the author's house. The author told Jim beforehand not to have the gun in the house, but Jim still had it during a session when the author wasn't around. The author then kicks him out, and there's mixed reactions from the group.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. In the U.S., concealed carry laws vary by state. If Jim has a valid permit, he might be legally allowed to carry in public places or private residences. However, the author is the homeowner, so they can set rules for their own property. Even if Jim is legally allowed to carry, the homeowner can ask him not to bring a gun into the house. So from a legal standpoint, the author has the right to enforce that rule.\n\nNext, the social aspect. The author felt uncomfortable with a gun in their home, even though they respect Jim's right to carry. It's their space, so they have the right to set boundaries. The fact that Jim didn't follow the rule immediately after being asked could be seen as a breach of trust. The author made it clear, and Jim either didn't comply or didn't take it seriously. That could justify the author's decision to remove him.\n\nThe reactions from the group are mixed. Some think it's fair, others not. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is the host, they have the authority to set the terms for their home. The key points are consent and respect for the host's wishes. Jim's actions were a violation of the agreed-upon rule, so the author's response was appropriate.\n\nAdditionally, Jim's response of quitting the group and the ongoing communication (texts and propaganda links) might indicate a conflict, but that's part of the aftermath. The initial action of the author was within their rights as the homeowner. So the answer is B: No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
