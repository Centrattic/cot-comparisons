  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking a guy out of my hobby group because of his concealed gun?\nI am in a little board game group that has been meeting regularly for the past six months. We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for kicking Jim out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. The author mentioned they're anti-gun, and they made it clear that no guns should be in their house. Jim said he would leave his gun in his truck, but later someone told the author that Jim had his gun with him when they were in the house. The author then told Jim he couldn't come back if he had a gun, and Jim left. The group is split, and now Jim is sending conflicting messages.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about personal property and safety. The author's house is their own space, so they have the right to set rules. Jim had a concealed carry permit, which means legally he can carry a gun, but the author is making a personal choice about their own home. The problem arises when Jim didn't follow the agreement to leave the gun in his truck. The author felt violated because the rule wasn't respected, which is a safety concern. \n\nBut some might argue that Jim didn't explicitly know he had to leave the gun in the truck, or maybe he misunderstood. However, the author did tell him privately beforehand. Jim's actions then were a breach of that agreement. The author had a right to enforce their rules, especially since it's their house. The other group members have mixed reactions, but that's their personal feelings. The main issue is that the author prioritized their own comfort and safety, which is reasonable.\n\nOn the flip side, maybe the author overreacted by kicking Jim out after one incident. But considering the seriousness of having a gun in the house, the author isn't being unreasonable. It's not about snacks; it's about safety. Jim chose to ignore the rule, so the author had the right to remove him. The author isn't in the wrong because they set clear boundaries and followed through when those boundaries were broken.\n"
