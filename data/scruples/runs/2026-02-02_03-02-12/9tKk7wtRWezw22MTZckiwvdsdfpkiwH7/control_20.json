We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is wrong for asking someone to leave their hobby group because that person had a concealed gun. The author is anti-gun, and when they moved game nights to their house, they told Jim to leave his gun in the truck. Jim didn't comply, and the author kicked him out. Now the group is split on whether the author was right.\n\nFirst, the key point is that it's the author's house. They have the right to set rules about what's allowed in their home. Guns can be a sensitive issue, especially for someone who's anti-gun. The author made clear their stance upfront, which is reasonable. Jim continued to have the gun on him despite being asked not to, which the author saw as a violation of their space. \n\nThe argument could be that Jim had a concealed carry permit, so legally he's allowed to carry, but the author's home is private property. Legally, the author isn't violating any laws by asking him to leave the gun outside. However, some might say that since Jim had a permit, he should be allowed to carry in his own vehicle, but the author is not obligated to allow that in their home. \n\nThe user's perspective is that safety and comfort are important. If the author feels unsafe knowing there's a gun in the house, it's their right to enforce that rule. On the other hand, some might argue it's a bit harsh to kick someone out over this, especially if Jim was following the law. But the author made the rules clear before the event, and when Jim didn't comply, the author took action. \n\nThe reactions of the group are mixed. One person doesn't care, another thinks it's harsh but fair, and one finds it uptight. But the author's stance is about personal boundaries in their home. Since it's their space, they aren't in the wrong for enforcing their rules. Jim chose not to comply, so the author isn't at fault for asking him to leave. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
