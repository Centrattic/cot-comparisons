We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he was carrying a concealed gun.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they hosted the group at their house and had a private conversation with Jim beforehand, asking him to leave his gun in the truck. Jim didn't fully confirm he'd follow that, but then later, during the event, Jim kept his gun with him when the author wasn't around. The author then told Jim he couldn't come back if he continued to carry a gun, leading Jim to quit the group.\n\nThe author's stance is that it's their house and they set the rules. They feel that guns in their home are a serious issue, not a trivial matter like wrong snacks. Others in the group have mixed reactions.\n\nNow, considering the rules of the situation. In the US, private property owners can set rules about firearms on their premises. Even if someone has a concealed carry permit, the property owner can prohibit guns. So the author likely has the legal right to enforce a no-guns policy on their property.\n\nEthically, the author is making a personal choice for safety and comfort. They communicated the rule beforehand but Jim didn't comply. The author then followed through, which is consistent. Jim's actions violated the agreed-upon rule, so the author's response seems reasonable.\n\nSome might argue that the author was too strict, but given the context of it being their home and the potential safety concerns, their decision isn't unreasonable. The fact that Jim continued to carry despite the request makes the author's action justified.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
