We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation (the author) is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he was carrying a concealed gun. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author hosts game nights at their house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and mentioned he carries a gun. The author told Jim beforehand that no guns would be allowed in their house, and Jim left his gun in his truck. However, during the event, when the author was in the kitchen, Jim told another member he still had the gun with him. The author then asked Jim not to come back if he was carrying, leading to Jim quitting. The group has mixed reactions, and the author is being criticized by one member for being too uptight.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's house rules, the legality of concealed carry, and whether the author overstepped. In the US, concealed carry is legal in many states, but the property owner can set rules about guns on their premises. So, the author has the right to prohibit guns in their home. But the question is whether it's reasonable to kick someone out over this.\n\nThe author made it clear before the event that guns weren't allowed. Jim, despite having a permit, didn't fully comply (he had the gun on him even though he was supposed to leave it in the truck). The author's main argument is that it's their house and they set the rules. Jim's side might argue that he was within his legal rights to carry, but the author's right to set house rules is also valid.\n\nNow, considering the reactions: some think it's fair, others harsh. The author's stance is about safety and personal comfort. Since the author made the rule clear and Jim didn't follow it, the author is justified in enforcing their rules. The fact that Jim continued to carry despite the agreement supports the author's decision. The author isn't violating any laws by asking Jim to leave if he doesn't comply with their house rules. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B (No).\n"
