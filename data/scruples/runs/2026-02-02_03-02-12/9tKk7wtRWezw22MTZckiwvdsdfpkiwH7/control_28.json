We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. The situation is that the group met at a shop before but now at the author's house. The author told Jim, who has a concealed carry permit, to leave his gun in the truck. But Jim had the gun on him during the first game night at the author's house, and the author kicked him out.\n\nFirst, the key point here is that it's the author's home. So, the author has the right to set their own rules about what is allowed in their house. Even though Jim has a legal concealed carry permit, the author can decide not to allow guns on their property. That's a common right people have over their private residences.\n\nThe author did give Jim a heads-up before the first meeting at their house, so they made their stance clear. Jim didn't comply, and the author took action after being informed that Jim had the gun on him. The author's reaction seems reasonable because they prioritized their own safety and comfort in their home. While some might argue that Jim was just following the law, the author isn't obligated to allow something that makes them uncomfortable in their own space.\n\nThe other group members have mixed reactions. Some think it's fair, some think it's harsh. But the author's position is about their own rules, not about the group's policies. The fact that Jim kept arguing and sending links suggests he's not respecting the author's boundaries, which reinforces that the author was in the right to remove him.\n\nSo the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they have the right to set rules for their home and enforce them.\n"
