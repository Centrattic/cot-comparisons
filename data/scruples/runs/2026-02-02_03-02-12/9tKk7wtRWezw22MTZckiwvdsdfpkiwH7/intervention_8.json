We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about someone kicking a group member out of a hobby group because he has a concealed gun at their house. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author hosts board game nights at their home. Jim, a member, has a concealed carry permit and brings his gun. The author is anti-gun but hadn't mentioned it before. They privately told Jim to leave the gun in his truck. Jim responded in a way that wasn't exactly confirming, and then later, another member told the author that Jim had the gun with him while the author was in the kitchen. The author then texts Jim that he's disrespectful and can't come back if he brings the gun. Jim quits, and there's mixed reactions from the group.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me consider the legal aspect first. Concealed carry laws vary, but generally, if someone has a permit, they can carry in private places unless the host explicitly prohibits it. So the author has the right to set their own rules for their home. Legally, the author is within their rights to ask Jim not to bring a gun into their house.\n\nNext, the social etiquette angle. It's the author's home, and personal comfort is important. Even if Jim had a permit, the author might feel unsafe. Setting boundaries is valid. However, some might argue that Jim had carried the gun previously in other locations (like the hobby shop) without issue, so maybe the author's reaction was too harsh. But moving the group to the author's home is a new setting, and the author has the right to establish new rules there.\n\nThe conflict arises because Jim didn't follow the author's instruction. The author made it clear, and Jim still brought the gun. The author's response was to kick him out, which is a consequence for violating the house rule. Since it's their home, enforcing that rule isn't unreasonable.\n\nThe mixed group reactions don't necessarily mean the author is wrong. People have different views on guns. The person who says it's \"harsh but fair\" suggests that while the action was strict, it was justified. The other person's criticism that the author was \"uptight\" is more about personal opinion than whether the action was right or wrong.\n\nAlso, Jim's continued texting with propaganda might indicate he's not accepting the decision, but that's his responsibility. The author's stance is about their own comfort and safety, which is a valid reason.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong because they set clear rules for their home, and Jim violated them. The author has the right to enforce those rules, especially in their own residence.\n"
