We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a board game group where one member, Jim, has a concealed gun. The author, who's hosting the meetings at their home, told Jim not to bring the gun. Jim said he had his gun during the first session, and the author kicked him out. The group is split on whether the author was right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In the US, concealed carry laws vary by state and local regulations. If Jim has a valid permit, he's legally allowed to carry. But when entering someone's home, the homeowner can set their own rules. So even if Jim is allowed to carry in public, the author can ask him not to bring a gun into their private residence. Legally, the author has the right to establish that rule.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The author mentions they're anti-gun, which is their personal belief. They communicated their rules clearly before the first session. Jim didn't comply, so the author followed through on their rule. The author isn't forcing Jim to attend; he's choosing to come. If he can't comply with the host's rules, he can't attend. It's about respecting the host's space.\n\nThe group's mixed reactions are interesting. Some think it's fair, others think it's harsh. But the key point is that the author made their rules clear. Jim's action was a violation, and the author enforced it. It's not about being uptight; it's about safety and personal boundaries. The author's house, their rules. Jim chose to bring the gun despite the prior warning, which is a breach of trust.\n\nAlso, the author handled it privately first, then after the incident, communicated again. They gave Jim a chance to comply but he didn't. The author's decision to remove him was to maintain their comfort and safety. Since it's their home, they have the right to set such conditions. The ongoing texts from Jim might be an attempt to continue the conflict, but the author isn't the one at fault here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They set clear boundaries, and Jim didn't respect them. The author's actions were within their rights as a homeowner.\n"
