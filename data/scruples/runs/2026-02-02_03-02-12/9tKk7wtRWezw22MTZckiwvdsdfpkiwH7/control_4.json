We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a board game group that meets at the author's house, and one member, Jim, has a concealed gun. The author told Jim not to bring the gun to their house, but Jim still did, leading the author to kick him out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author made it clear that they don't want guns in their house and asked Jim to leave his gun in the car. Jim, who has a concealed carry permit, didn't follow the rule. The author then decided he couldn't be in the group if he had a gun on him. Now, some group members are split on whether this was fair.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, it's their house, so they have the right to set rules. Not allowing guns in the home is a common safety rule. Jim didn't comply, so the author enforced the rule. The fact that Jim had a permit doesn't change the fact that the author's house is a private space where they can set boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that Jim was following the law by carrying a concealed gun. However, private property owners can enforce their own rules regardless of legal permits. The author isn't violating any laws by asking Jim not to carry a gun in their home. So, the author's action is about personal safety and comfort, which is valid.\n\nThe other group members' mixed reactions don't necessarily mean the author is wrong. The author made a decision based on their own boundaries. Even if others think it's harsh, the right to control one's own space is a strong point here. Jim's response was to quit, which is his choice, but the author isn't obligated to allow him to stay if he violates their rules.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to set their home's rules, especially regarding safety. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
