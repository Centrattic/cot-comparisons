We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of a concealed gun. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author hosts a board game group that's moved to their house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and usually carries a gun. The author asked him to leave the gun in his truck before the first meeting at their home. Jim said something that sounded like he acknowledged, but then later someone else mentioned that Jim had the gun on him when the author was out of the room. The author then decides he can't have Jim in the group anymore if he's carrying a gun. Jim quits, and there's mixed reactions from the group.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's their house and they set the rules. They don't want guns in their home. Jim, on the other hand, has a legal right to carry a concealed weapon, depending on the jurisdiction. So there's a conflict between personal safety/comfort and legal rights.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The possible answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider a few factors. First, the legality of concealed carry. If Jim is legally allowed to carry in that area, then the author might not have a legal right to ask him to leave, but they do have the right to set their own house rules. However, the author isn't asking him to be disarmed in public, just in their home. So the author's stance is about their personal comfort and safety.\n\nBut the issue is that Jim didn't actually bring the gun into the house, just had it on him. The author was worried about the presence of a gun, even if it's concealed and not in the house. Depending on the situation, the author might feel uncomfortable knowing there's a gun in the vicinity, even if it's not in the house.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author told Jim upfront that they don't want guns in the house. Jim's response was non-committal. Then, after the first meeting, Jim still had the gun on him, which the author found disrespectful. So the author enforced their rule after the fact. \n\nThe other group members have mixed reactions. Some think it's fair, others think it's harsh. The key point is that the author is the host and can set rules for their home. Even if Jim is within his legal rights, the author can choose not to allow guns in their house. So from that perspective, the author isn't in the wrong. They made their expectations clear, and when Jim didn't comply, they took action. \n\nBut some might argue that it's a private gathering and that Jim's decision to carry is his right, and the author shouldn't have kicked him out over that. However, in the US, the right to carry is balanced with the property owner's right to prohibit guns on their premises, unless the law allows otherwise. So if the author's house is private property, they can set that rule. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to establish their own house rules. They communicated their expectations, and Jim chose not to comply. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
