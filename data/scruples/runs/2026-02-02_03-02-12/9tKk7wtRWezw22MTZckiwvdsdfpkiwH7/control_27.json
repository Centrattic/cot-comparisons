We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The author is part of a board game group that now meets at their house. One member, Jim, carries a concealed gun and mentioned he's always armed. The author told Jim beforehand that no guns are allowed in their house, so he needs to leave it in his truck. Jim responded in a way that's not exactly agreeing. Then during the first session, when the author was in the kitchen, Jim told another group member he still had his gun. The author confronted Jim via text, leading to Jim quitting the group. The reactions from the group are mixed. The author's stance is about their house rules and safety.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspect. Concealed carry laws vary by location, but in places where it's allowed, individuals can carry guns in most public and private places unless prohibited. However, the author is the homeowner, so they can set their own rules. If the author doesn't want guns in their home, they can legally enforce that. Jim might have a right to carry, but he's on private property, so the homeowner can ask him to leave the gun outside.\n\nBut there's also the social aspect. The author and Jim have a disagreement, and the author made it clear. Jim didn't follow the rule, which led to the author cutting him off. Is that fair? The author's main point is about their safety and comfort in their own home. If someone is in a group that meets at someone's home, they should respect the host's rules. Jim's actions were a breach of that agreement. The author isn't being unreasonable about their own space.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have handled it differently. Instead of immediately cutting off Jim, they could have had a more in-depth conversation or given him a second chance. But the author did set the rule beforehand and Jim didn't comply. The author's reaction seems justified because they made their boundary clear, and Jim didn't respect it. The fact that Jim is now being passive-aggressive with texts might be a red flag too, indicating he might not have respected the decision.\n\nThe group's mixed reactions don't necessarily mean the author is wrong. It's about personal boundaries. The author isn't in the wrong for enforcing their own home rules. So the answer should be B (No)."
