We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is the host of a board game group that's moved to their house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun. The author told Jim beforehand that no guns are allowed in the house, and Jim was supposed to leave his in the truck. However, during the first game night at the author's house, Jim kept his gun with him when the author was in the kitchen. The author found out through another group member and then confronted Jim, leading him to quit the group. The author's reasoning is that it's their house and their rules, and they don't want guns there. The group is split on whether it was fair or not.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspect. Concealed carry laws vary by location, but generally, if someone has a permit, they can carry a gun in public places unless prohibited. However, private property owners can set their own rules. So the author, as the host, has the right to ask Jim not to bring the gun into their home. That seems legally sound.\n\nNext, the social aspect. The author and Jim have a hobby group where they spend time together. The author made it clear before the event that guns weren't allowed, and Jim didn't comply. The author's decision to remove Jim from the group is about personal boundaries. Since it's their home, respecting that boundary is important for the author's comfort and safety. Others in the group have mixed reactions, but the author's right to set those rules isn't in question here.\n\nJim's perspective: He might feel that since he has a permit, he should be allowed to carry in private spaces. However, the author has already communicated the rule, so it's about respecting the host's wishes. If Jim was aware of the rule but didn't follow it, that's a breach of trust. The author had a valid reason to enforce the rule, especially if they're anti-gun and this is a personal issue for them.\n\nThe author's actions seem justified because it's their house, and they have the right to set the terms for their own space. The fact that Jim didn't comply after being told is a problem. Even if others think it's harsh, the author's autonomy in their home is a key factor here. There's no indication that the author is being unreasonable; they addressed a serious matter directly. So the answer is likely B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
