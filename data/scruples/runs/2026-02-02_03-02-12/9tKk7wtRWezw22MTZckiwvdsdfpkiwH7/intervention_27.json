We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of a concealed gun. The situation is that the group moved to the author's house, and one member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit. The author told Jim he couldn't bring his gun into the house, but Jim brought it anyway during the first meeting. The author then kicked him out, leading to mixed reactions from the group.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Concealed carry laws vary by location, but generally, if Jim has a valid permit, he's allowed to carry in public places. However, in private homes, the owner can set their own rules. So legally, the author is within their rights to prohibit guns in their home. That's a key point.\n\nNext, the social context. The author's home is a private space, so they have the right to establish rules for their guests. Jim was informed beforehand and agreed, or at least acknowledged the rule. However, he still brought the gun, which the author found disrespectful. The author's decision to remove him for violating that rule seems justified from their perspective.\n\nThe mixed reactions from the group might indicate that some people don't see it as a big deal, but the author's stance is about personal safety and comfort. It's their home, and they have the right to feel safe. The fact that Jim continued to communicate with the author after being asked to leave (texting back and forth) might show he didn't take the issue seriously, which could reinforce the author's position that it was a serious matter.\n\nHowever, someone might argue that Jim had a concealed carry permit and was just following the law, so the author overreacted. But the key here is that the author's house is private, so even if he's legally carrying, the host's rules take precedence. The author's actions are about setting boundaries in their own space, which is a valid concern.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to set rules in their home, and they addressed a serious issue directly. The answer should be B (No)."
