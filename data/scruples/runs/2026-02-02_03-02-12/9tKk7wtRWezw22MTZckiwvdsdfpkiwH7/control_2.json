We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he was carrying a concealed gun.\n\nFirst, the author is the host of the game nights at their home. They made it clear before the first meeting that no guns were allowed in the house. Jim, who has a concealed carry permit, was told to leave his gun in his truck. However, during the first session, Jim kept his gun on him while the author was in the kitchen. The author then kicked him out permanently, leading to some mixed reactions from the group.\n\nNow, considering the key points. The author owns their home and has the right to set rules for their property. They communicated the rule in advance, so there's no ambiguity. Jim, despite being informed, violated that rule. The author took action after a single incident, which could be seen as strict, but they argue it's a serious matter. The other group members are split, but some support the author's decision.\n\nLegally, in the US, states have varying concealed carry laws. If the state allows concealed carry in private residences unless prohibited, the author might still have the right to prohibit guns on their property. However, if the law requires allowing carry in private homes, the author's rule might conflict with that. But the question isn't about legality per se but about moral/ethical wrongdoing.\n\nEthically, the author prioritizes their comfort and safety in their own home. They made the rule clear. Jim's actions were a breach of that agreement. The author followed through, which some might see as reasonable. Others could argue that a first-time offense was too harsh, but given the seriousness of the issue, it's a personal choice. The author isn't being unreasonable for enforcing their own rules. The fact that Jim continued texting with propaganda might indicate he's aware of the boundary being crossed. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
