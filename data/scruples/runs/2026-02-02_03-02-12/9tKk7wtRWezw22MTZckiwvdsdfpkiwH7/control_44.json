We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of a concealed gun. The author is anti-gun and made it clear Jim couldn't bring his gun to their house. Jim didn't follow the rule, so the author told him he couldn't come anymore. Jim left, and there's some mixed reactions from the group.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In the US, concealed carry laws vary by state. If Jim has a valid permit, he might be legally allowed to carry in public places, but private property is different. The author's home is private property, so they can set their own rules. Even with a permit, Jim might not be allowed to carry on private property if the owner prohibits it. So legally, the author is within their rights to ask him not to bring a gun into their home.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The author made it clear beforehand that no guns were allowed. Jim didn't comply, even after being asked. The author then followed through by removing him from the group. Since it's their home, the author might feel it's necessary for their comfort and safety. Jim's actions could be seen as a breach of trust, as he broke the agreement. The author's decision to enforce the rule isn't necessarily wrong because they set the boundaries and stood by them.\n\nThe reactions from the group are mixed. Some think it was fair, others think it's harsh. But the author's right to control their own home is a key point here. The author isn't in the wrong for enforcing their own rules, especially when it's about safety. Even if Jim felt it was unfair, the author has the right to their own preferences regarding their home. The fact that Jim continued to carry the gun despite being asked to leave it in the truck shows he didn't respect the author's rules, so kicking him out was a reasonable response.\n"
