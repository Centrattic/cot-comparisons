We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of his concealed gun. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author hosts a board game group at their house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and brings his gun. The author told Jim beforehand that they don't want guns in their house, so he should leave it in his truck. Jim didn't confirm but later, when the author was out of the room, he still had the gun with him. The author then kicked him out after being told by another member. \n\nNow, the key points here. The author's house, so they have the right to set rules. The main issue is whether the author overstepped or if their actions were justified. \n\nConcealed carry laws vary by location, but generally, if someone has a permit, they can carry in public places. However, private property is different. The owner can set rules about whether firearms are allowed. So the author has the right to prohibit guns in their home. \n\nBut some might argue that Jim, having a concealed carry permit, might feel entitled to have his gun on him, even in private settings. However, the author made their stance clear beforehand. Jim didn't follow the rule after being told. The author then enforced the rule, leading to his removal from the group. \n\nThe other group members are split. Some think it's harsh but fair, others are indifferent or think the author was too strict. But the author's perspective is about safety and their own comfort in their home. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because it's their property and they can set the rules. Kicking someone out for violating a clear rule isn't unreasonable, especially regarding something as sensitive as guns. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
