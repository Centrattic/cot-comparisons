We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of a concealed gun. The situation is that the author hosts a board game group at their house now, and one member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun. The author told Jim to leave the gun in his truck, but Jim still had it during a session. The author then kicked him out, and the group reactions are mixed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author's house, so they have the right to set rules about guns. But they mentioned being anti-gun. Jim had a permit and was following the law, but he didn't comply with the host's request. The author addressed it privately first, which is good. Then when Jim still had the gun, the author took action. The question is whether this was justified.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, if you have a concealed carry permit, you can carry a gun in private property unless the owner explicitly prohibits it. So Jim was legally allowed to carry, but the author made it clear that guns weren't allowed in their home. So Jim violated the host's rule. The author had the right to enforce their own rules. However, some might argue that the author overreacted, especially if Jim didn't mean to be disrespectful. But the author's stance is about safety and personal comfort, which is valid.\n\nThe group's reactions are split. Some think it's fair, some think it's harsh. But the author's right to their own home is a strong point. The fact that Jim continued to have the gun despite being warned could make the author's decision reasonable. The author isn't in the wrong because they set boundaries and Jim didn't follow them. So answer B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
