We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because the person had a concealed gun. The situation is that they moved the group to the author's house, and one member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit. The author told Jim beforehand not to bring the gun into the house, but Jim ended up keeping it with him during the first meeting. The author then asked him to leave the group, and now others are split on whether this was fair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, concealed carry is legal, so Jim is within his rights to carry a gun. However, the author is the host of the house, so they can set rules for their own property. The key point here is that the author established the rule beforehand, and Jim didn't comply. The author is enforcing their own rules, which is their right as the host. \n\nBut wait, the author said Jim had the gun on him during the event despite the prior warning. The author's concern is about safety and respecting the house rules. The other group members have mixed reactions, but the author's decision is based on personal boundaries. The author isn't violating any laws by asking someone to leave their home. \n\nJim's side: He might feel that it's his right to carry, but as a guest, he's expected to follow the host's rules. The author's action is about personal comfort and safety, which is valid. The author isn't being unreasonable because they made their stance clear from the start. The fact that Jim continued to disregard the rule led to the author taking action. \n\nThe user says they think the author is not in the wrong, and the options are A (yes) or B (no). The answer should be B. The author is within their rights to set house rules, and they communicated the rule, so enforcing it after a violation is understandable. The other members\u2019 opinions vary, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that the author's home has the final say.\n"
