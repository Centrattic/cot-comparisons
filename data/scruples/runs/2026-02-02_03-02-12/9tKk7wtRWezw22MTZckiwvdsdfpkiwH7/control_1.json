We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author is part of a board game group that's been meeting for six months. They used to meet at a shop but now meet at the author's house. There are five members, including Jim, who has a concealed carry permit and mentions he's always armed. The author told Jim privately that they don't want any guns in their house, so he should leave his in his truck. Jim responded in a way that wasn't a clear agreement. Then, after the first game night at the author's house, another member told them that Jim had his gun with him while they were in the kitchen. The author texted Jim, called him disrespectful, and told him he couldn't come anymore if he had a gun. Jim quit. The group's reactions are mixed. The author's stance is that it's their house and rules, and they drew the line because it's a serious matter, not like a snack issue. Jim is now texting back and forth, trying to remove his number and sending propaganda.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The choices are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspects. Concealed carry laws vary by location, but generally, if someone has a permit, they can carry in public places. But in private property, like someone's home, the owner can set their own rules. The author's house is private property, so they can decide whether to allow guns there. So legally, the author isn't in the wrong for not allowing guns on their property.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The author set a boundary beforehand, and Jim didn't comply. The author enforced the rule after the first offense. The group's opinions are split, but some think it's fair. Since the author made their position clear, and Jim didn't follow the rules, they have the right to kick him out. It's their house and their choice. The author might be anti-gun, but that's their personal stance, and they have the right to enforce that in their own home.\n\nHowever, maybe there's an argument that Jim was following the law by carrying a concealed weapon, which is allowed in some places. But even if he's legally allowed to carry elsewhere, the author's private property is a different matter. The key point here is that the author set the rule before the event, and Jim didn't adhere to it. The author isn't responsible for Jim's decision to leave; it's a matter of personal boundaries.\n\nAlso, the author's actions were direct and clear. They told Jim beforehand, and after the violation, they addressed it immediately. The rest of the group's mixed reactions don't necessarily indicate the author was wrong. The author's perspective that it's a serious issue (unlike a minor infraction) makes sense. The fact that Jim is now being argumentative and sending propaganda might be a separate issue, but the initial action was about enforcing their own rules.\n\nI don't see a strong argument that the author is in the wrong. They communicated their rules, gave a chance to comply, and enforced the consequence when the rule was broken. The author's right to control their own home is a key factor here. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
