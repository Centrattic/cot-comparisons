We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the author did the right thing by kicking someone out of their hobby group because that person carried a concealed gun. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the key facts: the author hosts a board game group at their house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and mentioned he's always armed. The author told Jim privately before the first meetup at their home that he needed to leave the gun in his truck. Jim didn't explicitly confirm, and later another group member found out Jim had the gun on him during the event. The author then told Jim he couldn't come anymore if he had the gun, leading Jim to quit. The group's reactions are mixed, and the author is now dealing with Jim's pushback via texts.\n\nNow, the main question is about whether the author was right or wrong. The user thinks the author is not wrong, but wants confirmation. Let me consider the angles.\n\nFrom the author's perspective: It's their home, so they have the right to set rules for their space. They made it clear upfront that guns weren't allowed, and Jim didn't follow through. The author's stance is that safety and comfort in their own home are paramount. Jim's actions could make others uncomfortable, even if not everyone in the group is anti-gun. The author took action after a clear violation of the agreed-upon rule, which seems reasonable.\n\nOn the other side: Jim has a legal right to carry, and the author might be overreacting. Some might argue that as long as the gun is concealed and not threatening, it's not an issue. However, the author's discomfort and the potential safety concerns (even if Jim is law-abiding) are valid. The author also had to establish boundaries, and doing so after a breach makes sense.\n\nThe group's mixed reactions add nuance, but the author isn't obligated to satisfy everyone. The key is that the author communicated their rules clearly, Jim didn't comply, and the author enforced the consequence. There's no indication of hostility beyond the rule enforcement. Jim's continued texts seem like he's escalating the issue, but that's on him.\n\nIn conclusion, the author acted within their rights as a host. They set clear expectations, and when those were violated, they took appropriate action. It's reasonable to prioritize one's own space and safety. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
