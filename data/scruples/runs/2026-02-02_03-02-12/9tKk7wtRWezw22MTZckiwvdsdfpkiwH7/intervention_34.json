We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for kicking someone out of their board game group because he had a concealed gun. The author is anti-gun but had never mentioned it before. They told Jim privately that guns aren't allowed in their house, but Jim didn't confirm, and later someone found out he had the gun during a session. The author then kicked him out, and now the group is split on whether that was the right call.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author made it clear that guns aren't allowed in their home. Jim was aware he had a concealed carry permit and had mentioned he's always armed. When the author set the rule, Jim's response was non-committal. The author then enforces the rule when they find out he's in violation, and Jim quits. Now the author is getting mixed reactions from the group.\n\nThe main issue is about personal boundaries in one's home. In most places, the homeowner can set rules about guns in their house. The author did that upfront, so if Jim knew the rules and still brought a gun, he's the one violating the agreement. The author's action seems to be about enforcing their own rules, which is their right. \n\nBut some might argue that Jim didn't explicitly know the rule was enforced that strictly, or that it's being too harsh for a hobby group. However, the author did communicate the rule before the event. It's their house, and safety is a reasonable concern. Even if the group is tight, personal safety takes precedence over social activities. \n\nThe user says they don't think the author is in the wrong. I agree. The author made their stance clear and followed through when it was breached. Jim had the choice to comply or leave. The author shouldn't be expected to tolerate something they find disrespectful, especially when it's a safety issue. The other group members' split opinions don't negate the author's right to set boundaries. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
