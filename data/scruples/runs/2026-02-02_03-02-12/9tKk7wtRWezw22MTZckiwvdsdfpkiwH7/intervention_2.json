We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he carried a concealed gun.\n\nFirst, the author hosted game nights at their home. They had a rule against guns in the house, which they communicated to Jim before the first session at their house. Jim, who has a concealed carry permit, mentioned he was armed. After the first session, another member told the author that Jim still had his gun with him while the author was in the kitchen. The author then told Jim he couldn't have a gun in the house and that he wouldn't be allowed back if he didn't comply. Jim quit the group, and there's mixed reactions from others.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's house, their right to set rules, and the issue of concealed carry. Legally, in many places, individuals can carry concealed guns as long as they have the permit. However, private property owners can set rules about guns on their premises. So the author legally can ask Jim not to have a gun in their house.\n\nBut here's the catch: Jim might have believed he could carry in his own car, even on private property. If the author's house is in a state where guns are allowed in vehicles, then Jim might have felt his rights were being infringed upon by being asked to leave the gun in his truck. However, the author is still within their rights to set that rule for their home.\n\nThe author's main argument is that it's their house and their rules. They addressed the issue immediately after the first incident, which is reasonable given the seriousness of the matter. They didn't wait for multiple incidents, which shows they took it seriously. The fact that Jim had a concealed carry permit doesn't override the host's right to set boundaries in their own home.\n\nThe other group members' reactions are split. Some think it's harsh but fair, others don't care, and one sides with the author. But the author's decision is about their comfort and safety. Even if Jim felt his rights were violated, the author isn't obligated to host someone they feel unsafe around.\n\nAdditionally, the author communicated the rule privately to Jim first, giving him a chance to comply. When he didn't, the author enforced the rule. That's a responsible approach. Jim's subsequent behavior, like sending mixed messages and propaganda links, suggests he's upset about the decision, but that's his reaction, not the author's fault.\n\nIn terms of ethics, while Jim might feel it's unfair, the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to their own property rules and safety. The situation is a clash between two rights: the author's right to a gun-free home and Jim's right to carry in public. But since the author's house is private, their rules take precedence.\n"
