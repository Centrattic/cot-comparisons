We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about them asking someone named Jim to leave their house because he had a concealed gun there. The group was meeting at their house, and the author made it clear no guns were allowed. Jim didn't follow that, so the author told him not to come back. The group's reactions are split.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the house. It's the author's home, so they have the right to set their own rules about weapons. Concealed carry laws vary by location, but even if Jim has a permit, private property owners can usually prohibit guns. So the author had the right to ask him not to bring the gun. When Jim didn't comply, the author had to make a choice. Since it's their house, they can ask someone to leave if they violate the rules. \n\nThe author did give a warning first, asking Jim to leave the gun in his truck. Jim didn't follow through, so the author followed up after finding out he still had the gun. The author's reasoning is that it's a serious matter, not a minor issue like snacks. The other group members are divided, but that's expected. The author's actions seem justified from a personal safety and property rights perspective. Jim's response and subsequent behavior (texting back and forth, sending propaganda) might indicate he's not handling it well, but the initial decision to enforce the rule seems valid. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they have the right to enforce their own house rules regarding weapons.\n"
