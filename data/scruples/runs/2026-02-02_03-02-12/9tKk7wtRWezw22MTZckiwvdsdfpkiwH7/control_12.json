We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a board game group meeting at the author's house, and one member, Jim, has a concealed gun. The author told Jim not to bring the gun, but later found out Jim still had it, so they kicked him out. The group's reactions are mixed, and now the author is being criticized by one member.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author owns their home, so they have the right to set rules about what's allowed there. Jim has a concealed carry permit, which is legal, but the author explicitly asked him not to bring the gun. Jim didn't comply, leading the author to remove him. \n\nThe question is about whether the author was wrong. From a legal standpoint, the homeowner can set their own policies. The author made their stance clear, and when Jim didn't follow through, the author enforced the rule. Some might argue that Jim's actions were a safety issue, especially if the author is anti-gun. Others might say the author overreacted for one incident. However, the author's decision is about their own space and comfort. \n\nThe other group members have mixed reactions, but the author's choice isn't about the group's feelings but their own boundaries. Since it's the author's house, they aren't in the wrong for enforcing their rules. The answer should be B (No).\n"
