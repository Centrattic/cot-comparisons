We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of a concealed gun. The key points here are about personal space, rules, and the right to feel safe.\n\nFirst, the author's house is their private property. They have the right to set rules, including not allowing guns. Jim had been told beforehand not to bring his gun, but he didn't comply. The author followed through by kicking him out after the first incident. The group's reactions are mixed, but the author's main argument is about their own comfort and safety.\n\nIn the US, having a concealed carry permit allows people to carry guns in public places, but private residences can have their own policies. The author made their stance clear, and Jim chose not to follow it. The author didn't force him out but made it clear that if he didn't comply, he couldn't attend. Jim then left voluntarily. The back-and-forth texts after might be a bit much, but the initial action seems justified based on the author's right to their own space and comfort. The other group members' mixed opinions suggest that while some see it as harsh, others agree with the decision. The author isn't being unreasonable here; safety and personal boundaries are valid concerns. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
