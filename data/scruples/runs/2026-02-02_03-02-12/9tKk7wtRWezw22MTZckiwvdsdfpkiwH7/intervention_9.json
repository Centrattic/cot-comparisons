We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the board game group situation is in the wrong for kicking out Jim because he was carrying a concealed gun. The answer options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is anti-gun but had allowed Jim to attend meetings at a shop before. Now that they're meeting at the author's house, they set a rule that no guns are allowed. Jim was told privately to leave his gun in the truck. However, Jim ended up keeping the gun on him during the first session at the author's home, even when the author was out of the room. The author then kicked him out, leading to Jim quitting the group. The reactions from the group are mixed.\n\nThe author's main argument is that it's their house and they have the right to set rules. The question is whether this rule is reasonable. Legally, in many places, a homeowner can set rules about guns on their property. Even if Jim has a concealed carry permit, the author's home isn't a public space, so the author can establish that policy. \n\nJim's actions might be seen as a violation of the agreed-upon rules. The author gave a clear instruction, and Jim didn't follow through. The author's response was to enforce the rule, which seems within their rights. However, some might argue that Jim had a right to carry and that the author was being overly strict. But the author's stance is about personal safety and comfort in their own home, which is a valid perspective.\n\nThe group's mixed reactions show that opinions vary. The key is that the author made their expectations clear and enforced them. There's no indication of harassment or unnecessary confrontation beyond the initial boundary being set. So, the author isn't in the wrong for enforcing their own house rules. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
