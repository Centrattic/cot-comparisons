We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author's group meets at their house now. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun. The author told him beforehand that guns aren't allowed in their house, and Jim was supposed to leave it in his truck. But during the first game night, Jim still had the gun on him when the author was in the kitchen. The author then told Jim he couldn't come back if he had a gun. Jim quit, and there's some mixed reactions from the group.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's their house and they set the rules. They were anti-gun but hadn't mentioned it before. They felt it was a serious issue, not something minor like snacks. Now Jim is sending conflicting messages and trying to remove his number.\n\nSo first, legal aspect: Concealed carry laws vary by location. If Jim has a valid permit, he might be allowed to carry in public places, but private property rules can be different. In some places, private property owners can prohibit guns on their premises. So if the author's state allows that, then the author is within their rights to enforce a no guns policy at their home.\n\nFrom a personal safety perspective, the author is uncomfortable with guns in their home. Even if Jim is licensed, the author has the right to feel unsafe and set boundaries. They asked Jim to leave the gun in the truck, which he didn't do. The author then followed through, which is consistent with their stated rule. \n\nSome might argue that it's harsh, but the author is standing by their own house rules. The fact that Jim had the gun with him despite being told otherwise is a violation, so the author is enforcing their boundaries. The group's mixed reactions show it's a sensitive topic, but the author isn't obligated to tolerate what makes them uncomfortable in their own space.\n\nJim's continued texting might be a separate issue, but the initial action of asking him to leave because of the gun policy seems justified. The author isn't in the wrong for enforcing their own rules in their home. So the answer should be B for No.\n"
