We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he was carrying a concealed gun. The author is anti-gun and set a rule that no guns in their house. The situation escalated when another group member told the author that Jim still had his gun during a session. The author then told Jim he couldn't come anymore if he had a gun, leading to Jim quitting. The group is split on whether the author was right.\n\nSo, the key points here are personal property rights versus personal comfort. The author owns their home and can set rules about what's allowed there. They communicated their rule to Jim beforehand, so he should have known. Jim didn't follow the rule, and the author enforced it. That seems reasonable. The author isn't forcing Jim to attend; it's a private gathering. They're using their right to set boundaries in their own space. Jim's response was to leave, which is his choice. The other group members have mixed reactions, but that doesn't affect the author's right to enforce their rules. The author isn't in the wrong because it's their house and their decision. So the answer should be B.\n"
