We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about someone kicking another person out of their hobby group because the person had a concealed gun. The key points are that the author is anti-gun and didn't want any guns in their house. They made it clear to Jim before the event that he had to leave his gun in his truck. But during the event, Jim still had the gun with him, and another member told the author. The author then told Jim he couldn't be there with a gun. Jim left, and the group's reactions are mixed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They own their house and set the rules. Jim had a concealed carry permit, so legally, he's allowed to carry in public, but in private homes, it might depend on the host's policies. The author made it clear that guns weren't allowed, and Jim didn't comply. The author's stance is that it's their house, so they have the right to set boundaries. That seems reasonable.\n\nFrom Jim's side, he might have felt that since he has a permit, he can carry in any private property. But actually, in many places, property owners can prohibit guns on their premises. So even if Jim is legally allowed to carry elsewhere, the author's private home is their domain. Jim might not have known that or thought it was okay because he's been in similar places before without issues. However, the author had specifically told him beforehand, so he should have respected that.\n\nThe other group members' reactions are split. One thinks it's harsh but fair, another thinks the author is being uptight. But the author's reasoning is about safety and personal boundaries. The author isn't just being petty; they have a strong stance against guns. It's understandable that they wouldn't want someone armed in their home, especially since it's a social gathering. The author didn't kick Jim out without warning; they gave him a heads-up and then followed through when he didn't comply.\n\nAlso, after the incident, Jim kept texting the author with conflicting messages and links, which shows he might be trying to escalate the situation. The author's decision to enforce their rule after a clear violation is justified. So, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They had the right to set their boundaries, communicated them, and acted accordingly when those boundaries were breached.\n"
