We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author has a hobby group that meets regularly. They moved the meetings to their house because they're closer, and now there's a guy named Jim who has a concealed carry permit. The author is anti-gun and told Jim beforehand that no guns are allowed in the house. But after the first session, someone told the author that Jim still had his gun on him when the author was in the kitchen. The author then told Jim he couldn't come anymore if he's armed, and Jim quit. The group is split on whether the author was right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspects. If Jim has a concealed carry permit, he's legally allowed to carry a gun in public places, but private property can have its own rules. Since the author is hosting at their home, they have the right to set rules for their property. So from a legal standpoint, the author isn't in the wrong for asking Jim to leave the gun outside. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong in terms of social or moral responsibility. The author gave a heads-up to Jim before the event, so he knew the rule. However, Jim still brought the gun. The author addressed it after the first incident, which was immediate. The problem is that Jim was still carrying the gun when the author was out of earshot. The author's right to feel unsafe in their own home is valid. Even if Jim didn't bring the gun in, just having it on him nearby might still make the author uncomfortable. The author's action was to remove Jim from the group, which is a personal decision about safety and comfort in their space.\n\nNow, considering the group's mixed reactions. One person thinks it's harsh but fair, another doesn't care, and one thinks the author was too uptight. The author's stance is about their own comfort and safety, which is their right. However, some might argue that Jim was following the law (if he's allowed to carry in that area) and that the author could have found a compromise. But the author clearly stated their rules beforehand. If Jim couldn't comply, then it's his choice to leave. The author isn't obligated to allow something that makes them unsafe, even if others find it extreme.\n\nAlso, Jim's response was to quit, so it's a mutual parting in a way. The author isn't forcing him to leave but is enforcing their house rules. The back-and-forth texts from Jim after might indicate he's upset, but that's part of personal conflict. The key point is the author's right to their space and safety. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
