We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is part of a board game group that moved to their house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and usually carries a gun. The author is anti-gun and told Jim he couldn't have his gun in the house. Jim said he understood, but then during the first game night at the author's house, Jim still had the gun with him. The author found out through another group member and then told Jim he couldn't come anymore if he was armed. Jim left the group. The reactions from others are mixed. The author now feels justified because it's their house and they set the rules.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about personal property rights and safety. The author made it clear that guns aren't allowed in their home. Jim, despite agreeing, didn't follow through. The author then took action by removing Jim from the group. \n\nIn the US, if someone is legally carrying a concealed weapon, they are allowed to do so in public places and in private places where the owner permits it. But the owner of the private property (the author) has the right to prohibit guns on their premises. So, the author had the right to set that rule. However, the question is whether the author overstepped by kicking Jim out over this.\n\nJim was informed beforehand and then, despite that, still brought the gun. The author found out after the fact and took action. The author's reasoning is that it's their house and they can set the rules. The other group members have mixed reactions, but one even said it was \"harsh but fair.\" \n\nNow, the author isn't just making a rule about snacks or something trivial. It's a safety issue. The author is uncomfortable with guns in their home, especially since they are anti-gun. They had a right to set that boundary. Even though Jim was legally allowed to carry, the author's home is their own space where they can enforce rules. Kicking someone out for violating a house rule isn't necessarily in the wrong, especially if the rule is clear and the person disregards it.\n\nJim's response was to quit, which he had the right to do. The author didn't force him to leave; they just revoked his invitation based on the violation. The fact that Jim is still texting with conflicting messages might show he's not handling it well, but the author isn't at fault for standing by their decision. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They set a rule, communicated it, and Jim didn't follow it. The author's action was within their rights. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
