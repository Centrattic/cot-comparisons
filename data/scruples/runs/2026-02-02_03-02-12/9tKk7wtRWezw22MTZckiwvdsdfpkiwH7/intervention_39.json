We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is part of a board game group that now meets at their house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and brings his gun. The author told Jim upfront that they don't want guns in their house and that he should leave it in his truck. Jim responded but maybe didn't fully agree. Then, after the first meeting at the author's house, another member told the author that Jim had his gun with him while the author was in the kitchen. The author confronted Jim and told him to leave the group if he's going to have a gun. Jim quit. The reactions are mixed, and the author is now getting mixed feedback.\n\nThe author's main argument is that it's their house and they set the rules. They felt it was important to enforce their rule about no guns, especially since it's a serious matter. Jim, on the other hand, might have felt that he's within his rights to carry the gun as per his concealed carry permit.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's right to set rules in their home, the legality of concealed carry, and whether the author overstepped by asking Jim to leave the group entirely.\n\nFirst, in the U.S., concealed carry is legal in most places with a permit, so Jim might have a legal right to carry his gun. However, the author has the right to request that Jim not bring the gun into their home, as private property rights allow the owner to set rules. The question is whether the author's action was reasonable.\n\nThe author gave a warning before the event, and after the first incident, they enforced the rule. Jim didn't follow the rule, so the author decided to kick him out. The group's split reactions suggest that opinions vary. Some think the author was justified, others think it was too harsh.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the author made a clear rule and enforced it. It's their house, so they can ask someone to comply or leave. Jim didn't comply, so the author removed him. That seems reasonable. However, maybe the author could have handled it differently, like giving Jim a second chance or just asking again. But the author felt it was a serious issue and not something trivial like snacks. So their action was based on safety concerns, which are personal.\n\nOn the other hand, if the law allows Jim to carry in someone's home, the author might be overstepping. But in most cases, private property owners can request that people not bring certain items, even if legal in public. So the author's stance is valid. Therefore, the answer is probably B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
