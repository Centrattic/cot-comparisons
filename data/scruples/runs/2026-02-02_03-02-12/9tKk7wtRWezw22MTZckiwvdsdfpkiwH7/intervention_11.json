We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong for kicking Jim out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. \n\nFirst, the situation: The group meets at the author's house, and the author specifically told Jim not to bring his gun. Jim didn't comply, and the author kicked him out. The rest of the group is split on whether this was fair.\n\nThe author's perspective is that it's their house and they set the rules. They don't want guns in their home, which they consider a serious issue. Jim had a permit but didn't follow the rule. The author acted quickly, which some see as harsh but fair, others not.\n\nNow, considering the user's own thought: They think the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to evaluate based on the scenario.\n\nKey points to consider: \n1. Home ownership and setting boundaries. In many places, homeowners can set rules about weapons on their property. If Jim was aware of the rule and chose to ignore it, the author has the right to enforce it.\n2. Jim had a concealed carry permit, which might mean he's allowed to carry in public places, but the author's home is private property. So the author can prohibit guns there.\n3. The author communicated the rule before the event. Jim's response was ambiguous, but he still brought the gun when asked not to. The author then took action after the incident was reported.\n4. The author's reasoning is about personal safety and comfort. Even if Jim is legally allowed to carry, the author's right to feel safe in their home is valid.\n5. The group's mixed reactions don't necessarily validate the author's actions, but they show that some understand the author's stance.\n\nPotential counterarguments: Maybe the author should have given Jim a second chance or handled it more privately. However, the author addressed it immediately, which shows they took the issue seriously. Also, the author's right to enforce house rules isn't necessarily \"harsh\" if they communicated it beforehand.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, private property owners can prohibit weapons on their premises, even if the person has a permit. So legally, the author is likely within their rights. Morally, it's about respecting personal boundaries. Since the author made their stance clear and Jim didn't comply, the author isn't in the wrong for enforcing their rule.\n"
