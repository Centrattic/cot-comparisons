We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. The author made it clear before the event that they didn't want guns in their house. Jim had a concealed carry permit and mentioned he always carries a gun. The author asked him to leave it in his truck, but Jim ended up keeping it on him during the event. The author then told him he couldn't come again if he had a gun, and Jim left. Some group members are upset, but others agree it was fair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author owns their house and has the right to set their own rules. Jim was informed beforehand, but he didn't comply. The author's stance is about safety and personal comfort. The legal aspect might be important too\u2014since Jim had a concealed carry permit, he's allowed to carry a gun, but the author can still enforce their home rules. However, depending on the state laws, there might be specific regulations about allowing or prohibiting firearms in private homes. But since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong morally or socially, not legally, maybe the main issue is about respect for the host's wishes.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong, so I should check if that aligns with common social norms. Generally, when someone invites people into their home, they can set boundaries. If someone doesn't agree with the host's rules, they can choose not to attend. Jim was given a warning, but he didn't follow through, leading the author to take action. The author's decision to enforce their rule seems reasonable. The split reactions in the group also suggest that opinions vary, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for prioritizing their comfort and safety. So the answer would likely be No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
