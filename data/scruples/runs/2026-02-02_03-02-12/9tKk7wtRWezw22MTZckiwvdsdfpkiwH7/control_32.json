We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this question. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of a concealed gun. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author hosts a board game group that moved to their house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and told the author he couldn't leave his gun in the truck. The author made it clear they don't want guns in their house. After the first game night, it was discovered that Jim had the gun with him when the author was away. The author then told Jim he couldn't come anymore if he had the gun, leading to Jim quitting. The group's reactions are mixed. The author's stance is that it's their house and they can set the rules.\n\nNow, considering the legal aspect: Concealed carry laws vary by location, but generally, in places where it's legal, people can carry in public spaces. However, private property owners can set their own rules. So the author is within their rights to prohibit guns in their home. Legally, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n\nEthically, it's a different question. The author is anti-gun, and this could be seen as a personal choice to create a safe environment for themselves. However, some might argue that Jim was following the law and that the author is overreacting. But given that the author is hosting their own home, they have the right to enforce such rules. \n\nThe key points here are: \n\n1. The author set clear rules upfront.\n2. Jim didn't comply with those rules.\n3. The author acted to protect their own space.\n4. The group's mixed reactions don't affect the rightness of the author's decision.\n\nThe author's actions were based on their right to control their property and ensure their comfort and safety. Even though others may have different views, the author isn't in the wrong for enforcing their own rules. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
