We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. The situation is that the group now meets at the author's house, and Jim, who has a concealed carry permit, was told to leave the gun in his truck. But during the first meeting, Jim had the gun on him when the author was out of the room, leading the author to kick him out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, concealed carry laws allow people to carry guns in private residences with the owner's permission. But the author didn't want any guns in their house. So if Jim was carrying without permission, that's against the author's rules. However, if the author allowed him to carry, then it's different. The author told Jim to leave it in the truck, so if Jim ignored that, he violated the agreed-upon terms.\n\nNext, the author's right to enforce their own rules. It's their home, so they can set the rules. If others in the group are okay with it, but the author isn't, that's their choice. The author's main issue is with the presence of the gun, not Jim's right to carry elsewhere. The group's split reactions show differing opinions, but the author's stance is about personal safety and comfort.\n\nJim's actions: he was informed of the rule, but then ignored it. The author felt disrespected and took action. The question is whether that action was justified. The author didn't just kick him out without a chance; they had a prior discussion. Jim's response was to leave, but the author's decision to enforce the rule seems reasonable given the circumstances.\n\nAlso, the author's follow-up texts from Jim about sending propaganda might indicate that Jim is upset and trying to argue the point, but the initial action was about enforcing home rules. The key point is that the author set a boundary, and Jim didn't comply, leading to him leaving. Since it's the author's house, they are within their rights to have that rule. The other group members' mixed reactions don't negate the author's right to enforce their own policies.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They made a clear rule, Jim didn't follow it, and they enforced the consequence. The answer should be B.\n"
