We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a board game group that meets at the author's house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and brings his gun. The author is against guns and told Jim to leave the gun in his truck. Jim didn't follow through, and after finding out, the author kicked him out. The group's reactions are mixed, and now the author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author made their stance clear before the first meeting at their house. They told Jim directly that guns aren't allowed. Jim responded in a way that wasn't affirming, so maybe he didn't take it seriously. Then, during the event, Jim kept his gun on him when he wasn't supposed to. The author then decided to exclude him from future meetings. \n\nNow, the question is whether that was right. The author's house, so they have the right to set rules. Guns can be a sensitive topic. Even though Jim had a permit, being in a private home changes things. The author was explicit about the rule, and Jim violated it. The author acted to enforce their own space's rules. \n\nBut some might argue that maybe the author could have given Jim a second chance or communicated better. However, the author's comfort and safety in their own home is a valid concern. Since the issue was about a serious rule (guns), not something trivial like snacks, the author's response seems justified. The group's mixed reactions show that opinions vary, but the author's right to their own space is a key factor here. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
