We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by kicking Jim out of the hobby group because he had a concealed gun. The author is very anti-gun and made it clear that no guns are allowed in their home. Jim had a concealed carry permit and initially was told to leave his gun in the truck. However, during the game night, Jim had the gun on him when the author was in the kitchen, and another group member informed the author. The author then told Jim he couldn't come anymore if he had the gun, leading Jim to quit.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Concealed carry laws vary by location. If Jim has a valid permit, he might be legally allowed to carry the gun in public places, including possibly private residences depending on the state. However, the author is the homeowner and can set their own rules. In some states, homeowners can prohibit guns on their property even if the person has a permit. So legally, the author might have the right to enforce a no-gun policy at their home.\n\nNext, the social dynamics. The author mentions that the group moved to their house because they were closer and the shop was in a less safe area. Safety is a personal concern, and the author felt uncomfortable with a gun in their home. They addressed it upfront, giving Jim a chance to comply, but he didn't follow through. The author then took a firm stance. It's about personal safety and respecting the host's rules.\n\nThe reactions from the group are mixed. Some think it's fair, others disagree. That shows differing opinions, but the author's decision is based on their own comfort and safety. The author isn't being unreasonable here; it's their home, and they have the right to set boundaries. Jim didn't follow the agreed-upon rules, so the author had to take action to maintain their own safety and the group's trust.\n\nAlso, the author handled it privately first, then acted decisively when the rule was broken. Jim's response was to leave, which he did. The ongoing texts from Jim are probably him trying to provoke or discuss the issue further, but that's on him. The author isn't at fault for enforcing their own rules. So, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
