We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because the person had a concealed gun. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author hosts a board game group at their house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and mentioned he always carries a gun. The author told Jim upfront not to bring the gun into the house, but Jim still had it on him during the gathering. The author then kicked him out, leading to some mixed reactions from others in the group.\n\nThe main issue here is about personal property and boundaries. The author's house, so they have the right to set rules. The user's perspective is that it's their house, and having a gun there is a serious matter, not something trivial. They took action after just one incident, which some might see as strict, but others might agree it's necessary for safety.\n\nI need to consider the legal aspects too. If Jim has a concealed carry permit, he's allowed to carry in public, but the author's home is private property. The author can prohibit guns there, as per many states' laws. However, some states might have specific laws about landlords or property owners allowing or restricting guns. But in this case, it's the author's own home, so they can set their own rules regardless of Jim's permit.\n\nAnother angle is consent. The author warned Jim before the event, but he didn't comply. The author felt disrespected and decided to remove him. Jim's response was to quit, which he has the right to do, but the author's decision to enforce their rule seems justified.\n\nThe other group members' reactions are mixed, but that's secondary. The key is the author's right to their space and safety. Even if Jim didn't bring the gun for snacks, the author's stance is about a serious safety issue. So, the author isn't being unreasonable in enforcing their rule once, especially if it's a deal-breaker for them.\n\nPossible counterpoints: Some might argue that the author overreacted, especially since Jim didn't act aggressively. But given the author's anti-gun stance and the private property rule, it's their choice. Also, Jim's behavior of texting back with propaganda might show he's not respecting the author's decision, but that's after the fact.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They set a clear rule, Jim didn't follow it, and the author took action to enforce their boundaries in their home. So the answer should be B.\n"
