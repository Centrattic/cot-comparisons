We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post did the wrong thing by kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun in their home.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author hosts a board game group at their house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun. The author told Jim beforehand that no guns are allowed in the house, and Jim was supposed to leave it in his truck. However, Jim still had the gun during the game night when the host was away. The author then kicked him out, leading to some backlash from the group.\n\nNow, considering the author's perspective: They own their home and set the rules. They were clear about the no-guns policy. Jim violated that rule, leading to the author taking action. The author's reasoning is that it's their right to have a safe space, and they drew the line because it's a serious issue, not a minor infraction.\n\nOn the other hand, Jim had a concealed carry permit and might have felt it's part of his rights. The others in the group have mixed reactions, with one person thinking it's harsh. However, the author made their stance clear before the event, so Jim had a chance to comply. The fact that the author addressed it immediately upon violation suggests they were firm but not unreasonable.\n\nLegally, in places where concealed carry is allowed, the host can establish a gun-free policy on their property. So the author has the right to enforce that. Socially, while some might think it's strict, the author is prioritizing their comfort and safety, which is valid. The fact that the issue was addressed after a single violation shows it wasn't a pattern, which might mitigate the \"harshness\" argument.\n\nThe other group members' mixed reactions don't necessarily indicate the author is wrong; it's about differing opinions. The author's actions align with their stated rules and their boundaries. So, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
