We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation was in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of a concealed gun. The answer options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The person, let's call them the author, runs a board game group that moved to their house. They told a member named Jim that he can't have his gun in their house. Jim has a concealed carry permit but decided to bring his gun anyway, despite being told not to. The author found out through another member and then told Jim to leave the group if he's going to carry a gun. Jim quit, leading to mixed reactions from others.\n\nThe author's stance is that it's their house, so they set the rules. Jim had a permit but didn't follow the rule. The author is anti-gun but hadn't had issues before. The key points here are the author's right to set boundaries in their home versus Jim's legal right to carry a concealed gun.\n\nNow, considering the laws in the US, which I assume this is set in, concealed carry laws vary by state. However, generally, if someone has a permit, they can carry in places where it's allowed. But in private homes, the owner can set their own rules. So, even if Jim is legally allowed to carry, the author can prohibit guns on their property. This is a key point. The author isn't violating any laws by asking Jim to leave the gun in his truck.\n\nJim, on the other hand, didn't comply with the rule set by the author. He brought the gun into the house despite being told not to. The author had warned him beforehand, and after the fact, Jim didn't follow through. So the author's action of removing Jim from the group for not respecting their house rules seems justified.\n\nThe other group members' mixed reactions don't necessarily make the author wrong. It's their house, and they have the right to enforce their comfort level. Even though some find it harsh, the author's decision is about safety and personal boundaries. The author isn't being unreasonable for prioritizing their safety in their own home.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they have the right to set their home rules, and Jim violated those rules, leading to the author's decision to remove him from the group.\n"
