We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The group moved to the author's house, and the author made it clear that no guns are allowed. Jim, who has a concealed carry permit, didn't follow the rule and kept his gun on him. The author then asked him to leave the group. The other group members are split on whether this was fair.\n\nThe key points here are about personal boundaries and safety. The author owns their home and can set rules. Guns can be a sensitive topic, especially for someone who's anti-gun. Even though Jim has a legal permit, the author's comfort and safety in their own home are important. The fact that Jim didn't comply with the rule the first time might justify the author's decision to remove him. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a middle ground. Could the author have addressed the issue without completely cutting him off? But the user asks if the author is in the wrong. Since the author communicated the rule beforehand and Jim broke it, the author isn't necessarily wrong for enforcing their own space. The other members' mixed reactions show it's subjective, but the author's stance is about their own home and safety. So the answer is likely B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
