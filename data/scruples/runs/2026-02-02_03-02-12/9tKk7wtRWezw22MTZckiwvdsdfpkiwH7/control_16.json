We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author did the right thing by kicking Jim out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author hosts a board game group at their house. Jim, a member, has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun. The author told Jim beforehand that no guns are allowed at their house, and Jim was supposed to leave it in his truck. However, during the first game night, Jim had the gun on him when the author was in the kitchen. The author then told Jim he couldn't come anymore if he had a gun, leading to Jim leaving the group. The group's reactions are mixed, with some thinking it's harsh but fair, others not caring, and one person disagreeing.\n\nThe author's argument is that it's their house and their rules. They didn't want guns there, so they enforced it. Jim, on the other hand, might have felt it was unfair since he has a permit and had carried the gun before without issues at the hobby shop. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in places where concealed carry is allowed, the homeowner has the right to prohibit guns on their property. So the author is within their legal rights to set that rule. However, the issue here is more about social dynamics and whether the action was reasonable. The author gave a clear warning before the event, but Jim didn't comply. The author then took immediate action after the incident. \n\nSome might argue that the author overreacted because Jim might have been unaware that the policy had changed from the hobby shop to the home, or that the author could have handled it more diplomatically. On the other hand, the author made it clear beforehand, and Jim's presence with a gun violated that clear rule. The fact that it was a serious matter (a gun in the home) versus something trivial (wrong snacks) supports the author's stance. \n\nThe group's split reaction shows there's no consensus, but the key point is the author's right to set boundaries in their home. While some might see it as harsh, others agree with enforcing personal safety policies. Since the author had set the rule and Jim broke it, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is likely B (No)."
