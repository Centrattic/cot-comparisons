We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for kicking Jim out of their board game group because he had a concealed gun. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author hosts game nights at their home. They have a group of five, including Jim, who has a concealed carry permit. The author is anti-gun but hadn't mentioned this before. Before the first game night at their house, they privately told Jim no guns in the house, and he was supposed to leave it in his truck. Jim's response wasn't clearly affirming, which might be a problem. Then, during the event, Jim was still carrying the gun when the author was in the kitchen. Another member told the author, so they confronted Jim via text, saying he was disrespectful and that he couldn't come again if he had a gun. Jim left the group. The reactions from others are mixed, with some thinking it was harsh but fair, others not caring, and one criticizing the author.\n\nSo, the main point is about whether the author had the right to set this rule. Since it's their home, they have the authority to set boundaries. Jim was aware of the rule but didn't comply, leading the author to enforce it. The author's reasoning is that it's their house and they don't want guns there, which seems reasonable given the potential safety concerns. However, some might argue that Jim's actions were within legal bounds (he has a permit), and the author's reaction was too quick. But the author had warned him beforehand, and Jim's non-committal response could imply he wasn't going to follow the rule. The author took action to protect their space, which is their right. The mixed reactions from the group suggest it's a nuanced issue, but the author's stance is about personal safety and comfort. So, I think the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
