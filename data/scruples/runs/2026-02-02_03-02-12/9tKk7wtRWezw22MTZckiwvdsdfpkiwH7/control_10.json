We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author is hosting a board game group at their house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and brings his gun. The author told Jim beforehand that no guns are allowed in their house, and Jim was supposed to leave his in his truck. But during the event, Jim still had the gun with him. The author then kicked him out, and the group is split on whether that was right.\n\nThe author's main point is that it's their house and they set the rules. They don't want guns there, and they enforced that rule after a first-time violation. Jim didn't comply, so he left. The other group members have mixed reactions. Some think it's fair, others think it's harsh.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are ownership of the property, the rules set by the host, and the guests' right to carry. Since the author is the host, they have the right to establish rules for their home. Jim had prior knowledge of the rule and still brought the gun, which could be seen as a violation. The author addressed it directly and removed him, which is a reasonable action for a host to maintain their space as they see fit.\n\nHowever, some might argue that Jim had a concealed carry permit and that in some places, carrying a gun in a private residence might be permitted unless the owner explicitly prohibits it. But the author did inform Jim beforehand, so even if there's a legal aspect, the social contract here is that Jim agreed to the rule. By not complying, Jim broke the agreement, and the author had the right to enforce the rule.\n\nThe other members' mixed reactions show it's a subjective issue, but the host's authority over their own home is a strong point in the author's favor. So, the author isn't in the wrong for enforcing their rule. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
