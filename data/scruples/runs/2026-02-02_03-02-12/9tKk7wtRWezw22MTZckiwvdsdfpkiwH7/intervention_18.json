We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of his concealed gun. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is hosting a board game group at their house. They have five people in the group. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and mentions he's always armed. The author, who is anti-gun, had a conversation with Jim before the first meeting at their house, telling him to leave the gun in his truck. Jim gave a non-committal response. After the first game night, another member tells the author that Jim had the gun on him when the author was in the kitchen. The author then texts Jim, saying he's disrespectful and can't come back if he's armed. Jim quits the group. The reactions from others are mixed, and Jim is still sending messages back and forth.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author had the right to enforce their personal rules about guns in their home. The author's stance is that it's their house and they set the rules. From a personal safety and comfort perspective, that makes sense. People have the right to their own property rules, especially when it comes to things that make them uncomfortable. Jim, having a concealed carry permit, might feel that he has the right to carry, but that doesn't override the host's right to set boundaries in their own home.\n\nHowever, some might argue that Jim wasn't threatening anyone and that the author overreacted. But the author's concern isn't just about the gun itself\u2014it's about feeling safe in their own home. Since Jim continued to carry the gun despite being asked, it's a breach of the host's rules. The author's decision to enforce their rule one-on-one is their choice, and they didn't publicly shame Jim, which could be seen as fair.\n\nThe other group members have mixed reactions, but the author's right to their own space isn't something others can dictate. The key here is consent and mutual respect. The group had been meeting at a shop before, and moving to a private home changed the dynamic. The author made their expectations clear upfront, and Jim's failure to adhere led to his departure. That seems reasonable. The author isn't in the wrong for upholding their personal rules, even if others disagree with their strictness.\n"
