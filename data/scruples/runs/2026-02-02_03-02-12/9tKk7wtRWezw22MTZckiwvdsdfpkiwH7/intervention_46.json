We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he was carrying a concealed gun. The author is anti-gun but didn't mention it before. The group now meets at the author's house, and they told Jim upfront not to have guns there. Jim didn't comply, and the author kicked him out. The reactions from the group are mixed, and Jim is still sending messages.\n\nFirst, the key points are ownership of the house, personal safety, and prior communication. The author's house means they can set rules. Jim was informed beforehand, so he should have known. The author didn't act on a whim but after a prior warning. Jim's action of keeping the gun despite the request is a breach of the agreed rules. The author's stance is about safety and respecting their space. Others in the group are divided, but the author's decision is about their own comfort and safety. Legally, in many places, the homeowner can prohibit guns in their home. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
