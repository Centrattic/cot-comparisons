We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking Jim to leave the board game group because he was carrying a concealed gun in their home.\n\nFirst, the user mentioned that the group moved to their house because they felt safer. So, the author is the host now. They told Jim privately before the first meeting that no guns were allowed in the house. He acknowledged but maybe didn't fully agree. Then, during the first session, Jim was still carrying the gun while the author was out of earshot. The author sent a text saying he was being disrespectful and that he couldn't come back with a gun. Jim left the group, and the reactions are mixed.\n\nNow, the key points here are about personal property and safety. The author's house, so they have the right to set rules. Guns are a sensitive topic, especially given the anti-gun stance of the author. Jim knew about the rule but didn't comply, which could be seen as a breach of trust. The author acted after one incident, which some might think too harsh, but others would agree it's about safety.\n\nOn the other hand, Jim might have felt his rights were infringed, especially if he relies on his concealed carry for protection. But the author's safety and comfort in their own home is a strong point. The fact that the author had already communicated the rule and Jim didn't follow it could make the author justified in enforcing it.\n\nSo, considering that it's the author's house and they set the rules, and Jim violated a clear rule, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer would be B, No.\n"
