We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun.\n\nFirst, the situation: the group moved game nights to the author's house. The author told Jim privately he couldn't have his gun in the house, but Jim brought it anyway once. The author then kicked him out. The rest of the group is split in their reaction. The author's reasoning is that it's their house and their rules, and they were firm because it's a serious matter.\n\nSo, I need to consider the key points here. The author made a clear rule about no guns in their home. Jim violated that rule, and the author enforced it by asking him to leave. Now, whether that's justifiable or not.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, as a private property owner, the author has the right to set their own rules for who can come into their home and under what conditions. Even if Jim has a concealed carry permit, which allows him to carry a gun in public, the author's home is private property, and the author can impose restrictions on weapons there. So legally, the author is in the right.\n\nEmotionally and socially, the author had a right to feel unsafe, even if Jim wasn't threatening. The author is anti-gun, so the presence of a gun might cause anxiety. The author addressed it directly before the issue, gave a warning, and then followed through when the rule was broken. That seems reasonable. The fact that the author put their foot down on the first offense suggests they take the issue seriously, which is understandable.\n\nNow, the counterarguments: Some might say that Jim didn't cause harm, just had a gun, and that the author overreacted. But the author made it clear from the start that guns weren't allowed. The fact that Jim didn't follow the rule, even after being told, is a breach of trust. The author isn't in the wrong for enforcing their own boundaries in their home.\n\nThe reactions from the group are mixed, but that's common in AITA situations. The author's right to control their own space is a strong point. Unless there's a legal requirement that allows concealed carry in private homes (which I don't think exists unless the state has specific laws, but generally, property owners can prohibit guns on their premises), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
