We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of a concealed gun. The situation is about a board game group that moved to the author's house. Jim, a member, has a concealed carry permit and mentioned he usually carries a gun. The author told him not to bring it into the house, but Jim did so anyway during their first session there. The author then told Jim he couldn't come anymore if he was going to have a gun on him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author made a clear rule about not having guns in their house, which is their right. Jim didn't follow that rule, leading to his removal. The group split in their reactions, but the author's stance is about safety and setting boundaries in their own home. \n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider legal and social aspects. In the US, gun laws vary, but as a host, the author can set rules for their property. Jim's concealed carry permit doesn't necessarily override the host's wishes unless there's a specific law requiring it. Socially, people have different comfort levels with guns. The author prioritized their comfort and safety, which is a valid reason. \n\nHowever, some might argue that Jim was following the law and that the author overreacted. But the author's house, so they can enforce their own rules. The fact that Jim didn't respect the rule and continued to bring the gun, despite being asked, supports the author's decision. \n\nThe other group members' mixed reactions might reflect differing opinions, but the author isn't obligated to accommodate views that infringe on their own space. The author's actions seem justified. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
