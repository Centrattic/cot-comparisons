We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for kicking Jim out of their board game group because Jim had a concealed gun.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they told Jim privately before the first game night at their house that they didn't want any guns. Jim responded in a way that wasn't exactly affirming. Then, during the first session, Jim ended up keeping the gun with him when the author was out of the room. The author then told Jim he couldn't come back if he had a gun. Jim left the group after that.\n\nThe author's main point is that it's their house and their rules. They consider the presence of a gun a serious issue. Others in the group are split on whether the author was right. One person thinks it's harsh but fair, another thinks the author is being a shrew, and another doesn't care.\n\nNow, the key factors here are consent and safety. The author clearly communicated their rules beforehand. Jim, however, didn't follow through, which led to the conflict. Concealed carry laws can vary, but generally, if someone is carrying a concealed weapon in a private residence, it might require the owner's permission. So, if the author didn't allow it, Jim shouldn't have been carrying there.\n\nThe author's decision to enforce their own house rules isn't unreasonable. They made their stance clear. Jim's actions violated that rule, so the author taking action to remove him isn't wrong. The arguments from others in the group don't negate the author's right to set boundaries in their own home. Even if Jim had a permit, the author's comfort and safety are paramount. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
