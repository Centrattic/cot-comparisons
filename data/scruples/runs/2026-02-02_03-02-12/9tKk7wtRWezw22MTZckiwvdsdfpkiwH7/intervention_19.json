We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of this Reddit-style post is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of a concealed gun. The situation is that the author's group moved to their house, and one member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit. The author told Jim that he can't have his gun in the house, but Jim didn't fully comply. The author then kicked him out, and there's some mixed reactions from the group.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In the U.S., concealed carry laws vary by state. Some states allow guns in private homes with a permit, others don't. The author mentions it's their house, so they can set rules. But if the law allows Jim to carry there, maybe the author can't enforce a no-gun policy. Wait, but the author isn't saying they can't have a gun in their home legally, just that they don't want it. So even if it's legal, the host can set their own rules. So legally, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because it's their property.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The author is anti-gun, which is their personal stance. They set a boundary, and when that boundary was crossed, they took action. The user's question is about whether they were wrong. The key points here are consent and personal safety. The author feels that having a gun in their home is a serious issue, not a minor infraction. The other group members have mixed reactions, but the author's decision is about their comfort and safety.\n\nBut some might argue that Jim was just following the law and that the author is being overly sensitive. However, the author made the rule clear before the event. Jim didn't fully comply, leading to the author's decision. The fact that Jim continued to carry the gun despite being asked to leave it in his truck could be seen as a breach of the agreed-upon rules, not just a legal issue.\n\nAlso, the author isn't forcing Jim to not have a gun; they're just asking him not to bring it into the house. So the author's action is about their own space and comfort. Since the group is at the author's home, they have the right to set the rules. The other members' mixed reactions don't necessarily mean the author was wrong. It's a personal choice about their own home.\n\nIn summary, the author set a rule, communicated it, and enforced it when it was broken. Even if Jim had a legal right to carry, the author has the right to their own space. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
