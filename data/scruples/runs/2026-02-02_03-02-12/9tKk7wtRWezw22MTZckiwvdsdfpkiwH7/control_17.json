We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a board game group that moved to their house, and one member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and brings his gun. The author, who is anti-gun, told Jim to leave the gun in his truck, but Jim still brought it, leading the author to kick him out. The group's reactions are mixed, and now the author is being criticized by some.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author made a clear rule about no guns in their house. Jim was told, but he didn't comply. The author then decided to remove Jim from the group. The question is whether the author was wrong in doing so.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in the US, the right to bear arms is protected, but gun laws can vary by state. Concealed carry laws might require people to keep the gun holstered and not visible. However, the author is setting rules for their own home. Homeowners can set their own rules, even if they're stricter than local laws. So if the author doesn't want guns in their house, they can ask people to leave them outside. It's their property, so they have the right to do that.\n\nBut the issue here is that Jim was told to leave the gun in his truck, but he didn't. The author then followed through by kicking him out. The author's reasoning is that it's a serious matter, not something trivial. The other group members are split, which could indicate some conflict, but the main issue is the author's right to enforce their rules.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of the group dynamic. The author might have handled it differently, maybe by discussing it more openly with the group first or giving Jim another chance. But the author's stance is that it's a serious safety issue. If someone is carrying a concealed weapon in a private home, even with a permit, the homeowner can enforce their rules regardless of the person's legal right to carry.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries in their home, and enforcing a no-guns rule after a clear violation is understandable. The answer should be B (No).\n"
