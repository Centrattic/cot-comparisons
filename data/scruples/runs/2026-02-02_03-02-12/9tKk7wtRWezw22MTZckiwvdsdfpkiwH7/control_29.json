We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group due to a concealed gun. The situation involves a board game group moving to the author's house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and mentions he's always armed. The author told Jim not to bring his gun, but Jim didn't fully comply. Then someone else told the author that Jim had his gun during the event when the author was out. The author then told Jim he couldn't come anymore if he had a gun. Jim quit.\n\nThe author's stance is that it's their house and their rules. They consider it a serious issue, not something trivial like snacks. The reactions from others are mixed: one doesn't care, one says it's harsh but fair, one thinks the author was too uptight. Jim is now sending mixed messages and propaganda.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author made their rules clear. They asked Jim to leave the gun in his truck. Jim didn't comply, and then it came out he had it during the event. The author had the right to set boundaries for their home. Even though Jim had a permit, the author's comfort and safety in their own space is a valid concern. The fact that the author gave a warning first shows they weren't abrupt. The others in the group have mixed opinions, but the key here is the author's right to their home. So, I think the answer is B\u2014No, the author isn't in the wrong. They had the right to enforce their rule.\n"
