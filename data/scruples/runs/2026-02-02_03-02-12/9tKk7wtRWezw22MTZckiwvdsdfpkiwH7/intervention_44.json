We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because the person was carrying a concealed gun.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author organizes a board game group that moved to their house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and mentioned he always carries a gun. The author told Jim privately not to bring guns to their house. Jim didn't explicitly agree but later told another group member he still had his gun present when the author was in the kitchen. The author then told Jim not to come again if he had a gun, leading Jim to quit the group. The group's reactions are mixed.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to decide between A (Yes) or B (No).\n\nLet me break it down. The author's home is their own space, and they have the right to set rules. Being anti-gun is a personal right, and safety is a valid concern. The author gave a clear warning before the first meeting at their house. Jim didn't confirm he'd follow the rule but then violated it. The author took action after the incident, which was a one-time occurrence. \n\nOn the other hand, Jim had a concealed carry permit, which is legal, and he might not have felt it necessary to leave his gun in the truck. However, the author's right to their own home and safety should be respected. The author didn't make a big deal until the violation happened, which seems reasonable. The others in the group have mixed opinions, but the author's stance is about their own comfort and safety.\n\nSo, the key points are ownership of the space, personal safety, and prior communication. The author acted within their rights to enforce their rules. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
