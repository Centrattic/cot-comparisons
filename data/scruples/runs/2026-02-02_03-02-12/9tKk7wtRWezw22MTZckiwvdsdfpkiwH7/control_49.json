We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong for asking Jim to leave their hobby group because he brought a concealed gun to their home.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about personal property and safety. The author made it clear that they don't want guns in their house. Jim had a concealed carry permit, so he's legally allowed to carry, but the author's home is private property. In many places, the property owner can set rules, even if someone is legally allowed to carry elsewhere. So, the author's stance that it's their house and their rules seems valid.\n\nThen there's the issue of Jim bringing the gun despite being asked to leave it in his truck. The author gave a specific instruction, and Jim didn't follow through. That's a breach of the agreement. The author felt disrespected because Jim didn't honor that request. The other group members' mixed reactions don't necessarily make the author wrong; personal safety and comfort in one's home are significant factors.\n\nAnother angle is that Jim might argue it's his right to carry, but in a private residence, the property owner's rules typically override that. The author's decision to end the group's participation at their house because of this could be seen as enforcing their own boundaries. The fact that Jim chose to leave rather than comply might indicate he wasn't willing to respect the author's rules, which the author has every right to set.\n\nAlso, the author didn't just kick him out without warning. They had a prior conversation and gave Jim a chance to comply. When he didn't, the author took action. That's a reasonable step when someone doesn't respect your boundaries. The follow-up texts from Jim could be seen as trying to continue a conflict, which the author isn't responsible for.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They set clear boundaries on their property, and Jim's failure to adhere to them led to the consequences. The author's actions were about their comfort and safety, which are valid concerns.\n"
