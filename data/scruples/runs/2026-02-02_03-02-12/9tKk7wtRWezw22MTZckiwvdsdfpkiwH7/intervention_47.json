We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he was carrying a concealed gun. The key points here are about personal boundaries, safety, and mutual respect.\n\nFirst, the author's house is their private space. They set a clear rule before the first meeting at their home: no guns. Jim was informed and initially acknowledged that. But then later, he broke that rule by keeping his gun on him during a session. The author found out through another group member and took action. \n\nThe author's stance is about feeling safe in their own home. It's reasonable for someone to have such a rule, especially if they're anti-gun. The issue here is whether enforcing that rule after a violation was justified. Jim didn't follow through with the agreed-upon rule, so the author felt compelled to act. \n\nJim's response was to quit, which he did. The group's mixed reactions might indicate that some see the author's action as strict, but others agree. The author had a right to set the terms for their space, and if someone refuses to comply, it's within their rights to remove them. \n\nHowever, maybe the author could have handled it more diplomatically? Like giving Jim a chance to explain or rectify the situation first. But in the scenario, the author had already set a clear rule, and Jim broke it. The author then communicated their disappointment and set a boundary. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They maintained their right to a safe environment. The answer should be B.\n"
