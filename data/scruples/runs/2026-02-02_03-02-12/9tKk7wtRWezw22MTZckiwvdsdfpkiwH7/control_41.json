We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he was carrying a concealed gun. The author is anti-gun but had never mentioned it before. They told Jim privately that he couldn't have the gun in their house, but Jim still brought it after the first game night. The author then kicked him out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's right to set rules in their own home. It's their house, so they can decide who is allowed in and under what conditions. Guns are a sensitive topic, and safety is a valid concern. Even if Jim has a permit, the author might feel unsafe knowing there's a gun present. The author gave Jim a clear warning first, which is reasonable. When Jim didn't comply, the author took action. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that Jim had a right to carry in public places, but the author's home is private property. The author made their stance clear, so Jim should have respected that. However, there's a part where the author sent Jim a text saying he was disrespectful and kicked him out. The other members are split, with some finding it harsh but fair, others not caring, and one being critical.\n\nThe key points are the author's right to control their home, the prior warning given, and the seriousness of the issue. Since the author set clear boundaries and Jim didn't adhere, the author's decision seems justified. The answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
