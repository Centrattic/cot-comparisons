We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun at their house.\n\nFirst, the author made it clear that they don't want guns in their home. They told Jim privately before the first meeting at their house to leave his gun in the truck. Jim didn't exactly confirm, but the author assumed he would comply. However, during the first game night, Jim still had the gun with him when the author was out of the room. The author then confronted him and told him not to come back if he's going to bring a gun. Jim quit the group, and there's mixed reaction from the rest of the group.\n\nNow, the key points here are about the author's right to set rules in their own home and how they enforced them. The author is anti-gun, which is a personal belief, but the main issue is about safety and comfort in their own space. Jim, having a concealed carry permit, might have thought it was okay to bring the gun, but the author's house is a private space where the host can set boundaries. \n\nIn the US, as long as there's no illegal activity, individuals have the right to carry guns in public, but in private property, the owner can set their own rules. The author is within their legal rights to ask someone not to have a gun in their home. Ethically, it's about respecting the host's wishes. The author gave a clear warning, and when Jim didn't comply, the author took action. Even though the other group members have mixed opinions, the author's decision was based on their own comfort and safety. \n\nJim's response was to quit, which is his choice, but the author isn't obligated to accommodate someone who disregards clear rules. The author isn't being \"uptight\" about a serious safety issue. It's reasonable to enforce such a rule, especially since the group moved to a private residence where the host's rules apply. The author isn't in the wrong here because they maintained their boundary, which is their right.\n"
