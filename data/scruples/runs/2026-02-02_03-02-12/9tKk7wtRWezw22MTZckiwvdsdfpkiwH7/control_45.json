We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of a concealed gun.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The group meets at the author's house now. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and mentioned he always carries a gun. The author asked him to leave it in his truck, which Jim kind of acknowledged. But later, another group member told the author that Jim still had his gun during a session when the author was in the kitchen. The author then told Jim he couldn't come to the house anymore if he had a gun, leading Jim to leave the group. The reactions from others are mixed.\n\nThe author's stance is that it's their house and their rules. They don't want guns there. Jim, on the other hand, felt it wasn't a big deal and continued to carry, leading to the conflict.\n\nNow, considering the legal aspect: In the US, concealed carry laws vary by state. If Jim has a valid permit, he's allowed to carry in public places. However, private property owners can set their own rules. The author, as the homeowner, has the right to prohibit guns on their property, even if Jim has a permit. So legally, the author is within their rights.\n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong morally or socially, not just legally. The author did ask Jim privately first, which is a respectful approach. Jim then continued to carry the gun despite the request, which breaches the trust and safety the author felt necessary. The author's action was about their personal safety and comfort in their home. \n\nSome might argue that it's a harsh reaction, but the author's right to their space is a strong point. The other group members have mixed reactions, but the majority seem to support the author's decision, at least in part. The fact that the author gave a warning and then followed through after the second incident shows they tried to accommodate Jim's preferences first.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is not in the wrong legally, as they can enforce their own rules on private property. Morally, it's about respecting personal boundaries. Since the author communicated their rules and Jim didn't comply, it's reasonable for the author to remove Jim from the group. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
