We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of a concealed gun. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is part of a board game group that now meets at their house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and mentioned he's always armed. The author told Jim privately that no guns are allowed in their house, so Jim should leave his in the truck. But then, after the first game night, another member told the author that Jim still had his gun with him while the author was in the kitchen. The author then texts Jim, saying he was disrespectful and can't come back if he's armed. Jim quits. The group reactions are mixed, and now the author is seeking advice if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author's stance is about their own home rules. They made it clear to Jim that guns aren't allowed. Jim, despite being told, kept his gun on him when the author wasn't around. The author then enforces their rule by excluding Jim. \n\nLegally, the author is within their rights to set rules for their home. No one is required to allow someone to bring a gun into their private residence. Jim has the right to carry, but he must follow the host's rules. The author isn't violating any laws by asking Jim to leave his gun outside. \n\nSocially, it's about personal boundaries. The author is anti-gun, which is their personal belief. They chose to set a boundary early on. Jim didn't comply, so the author followed through. The fact that Jim didn't affirm the author's request explicitly might be a point, but the author's rule was clear. \n\nThe other group members have mixed reactions, but the author's action was about safety and personal comfort. The author isn't being unreasonable. They addressed the issue directly after a breach. The back-and-forth texts from Jim afterward might show he's upset, but the author's initial action was justified.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They enforced their home rules, which is acceptable. Jim's choice to carry in a private home against the host's wishes is the issue here. The answer should be B.\n"
