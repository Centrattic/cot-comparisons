We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of carrying a concealed gun. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author hosts a board game group at their house. Jim, a member, has a concealed carry permit and brings his gun. The author had previously told Jim that guns are not allowed in their home. Despite that, Jim brought his gun anyway. The author then asked him to leave the group.\n\nThe key points here are about personal boundaries and consent. The author made their stance clear before the event. Jim ignored that boundary, which led to the author enforcing their rule. The author's reasoning is that it's their house and they have the right to set the rules. \n\nNow, considering different perspectives: Some might argue that Jim has a legal right to carry a gun, so the author shouldn't have an issue. Others might support the author's right to control their home environment. \n\nIn the US, the Second Amendment allows for concealed carry in many places, but private property owners can set their own rules. So, Jim could legally carry, but the author's home is private property. Therefore, the author isn't violating any laws by asking him to leave.\n\nThe author's action seems reasonable given their prior communication and the fact that Jim disregarded it. The author's justification is about safety and personal comfort, which are valid concerns. The fact that Jim continued to carry despite being told shows a lack of respect for the host's rules.\n\nThe other group members' reactions are split, but the author's main point is about enforcing their own space. There's no indication that the author acted out of malice or without prior notice. So, the author's actions are within their rights and reasonable given the circumstances.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
