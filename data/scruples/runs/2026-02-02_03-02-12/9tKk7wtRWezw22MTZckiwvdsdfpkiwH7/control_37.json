We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of a concealed gun.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author hosts a board game group at their house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and usually carries a gun. The author told Jim privately not to bring the gun to their house. Jim acknowledged but later had the gun with him during a session when the author was out of the room. The author then kicked Jim out of the group. The reactions from others are mixed, with some finding it fair and others disagreeing.\n\nSo, the main points here are about personal boundaries, ownership of space, and laws regarding concealed carry. In the US, the Second Amendment allows for gun ownership, including concealed carry, depending on state laws. If Jim has a valid permit, he can carry in most places, but private property exceptions can apply. The author is setting a rule that their house is gun-free, which is their right as the host. Even if Jim is legally allowed to carry, the host can establish rules for their own property. \n\nBut wait, some states have laws that protect the right of people with permits to carry in private businesses unless the owner specifically prohibits it. However, this is more about businesses. Homes might be a different case. The author isn't a business, so they can set their own rules. The key here is that the author made it clear that guns weren't allowed. Jim violated that rule, so the author's action of asking him to leave is within the host's discretion. \n\nThe author's actions seem reasonable because they communicated the policy beforehand. Jim's breach was significant because he had the gun on him during the event without informing the host. The author's stance is about safety and comfort in their own home. Even if others think it's harsh, the host's authority over their property is a strong point. \n\nAlso, the user mentions that Jim isn't being forced to leave the group by anyone else; the author is the one making the decision as the host. The group dynamics are affected, but the author's right to set rules for their space isn't in question here. The repeated texts from Jim might indicate he's still engaged, but the initial decision to kick him out seems justified given the prior agreement was broken.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
