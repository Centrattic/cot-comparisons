We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about someone kicking a group member out of their hobby group because he has a concealed gun in their house.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author hosts board game nights at their home. They told Jim privately that guns aren't allowed in their house. Jim acknowledged but maybe didn't fully agree. Then, after the first session, another member says Jim had his gun with him when the author was out of the room. The author then tells Jim he can't come to their house anymore if he's armed, leading Jim to quit. The group has mixed reactions.\n\nThe author's stance is that it's their house, so they have the right to set rules. The key points here are about personal property rights and safety. The author made their rule clear before the event, and Jim didn't follow it. Even if they didn't explicitly state a strict policy beforehand, once the rule was set, Jim's continued presence with a gun violates that rule.\n\nBut maybe there's a nuance. Did the author give Jim a chance to fix the issue? The author told him before the first event to leave the gun in his truck. Then after the first event, Jim broke the rule. The author then took action. It seems like a reasonable response. Also, the author's discomfort with guns is personal, but safety is a valid concern, especially in someone's home. \n\nSome people might argue that Jim had a concealed carry permit and felt he had the right to be armed where he is, but the author's home is their private space. They can set their boundaries. The group's reactions are mixed, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong. The decision to enforce their rule is about their comfort and safety. \n\nAnother angle: if the author allowed the group to meet in a public place where guns might be allowed, but when moving to a private home, the rules change. That's within their rights. So the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
