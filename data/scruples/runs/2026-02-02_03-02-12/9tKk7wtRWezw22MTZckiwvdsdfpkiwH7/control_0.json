We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he was carrying a concealed gun. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The group meets regularly, and they moved to the author's house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and mentioned he carries a gun. The author told him privately to leave the gun in his truck, but later found out Jim had it with him during the gathering. The author then told Jim he couldn't come if he was armed, leading to Jim quitting.\n\nNow, considering the author's perspective: it's their house, and they set the rules. They made their stance clear beforehand. Jim didn't comply, and the author took action. The user is asking if this action makes the author at fault.\n\nOn the other hand, Jim has a legal right to carry, so maybe the author overstepped? But the author made it clear that guns weren't allowed in their home. Jim didn't follow the rule, so the author enforced it. The group has mixed reactions, but the key point is whether the author had the right to enforce that rule.\n\nLegally, the author can set rules for their property. Socially, it's a personal choice. Even if Jim has a permit, the author's comfort and safety in their own home is a valid concern. Jim's continued presence with a gun after being asked not to carry might be seen as a violation. The author's reaction could be seen as upholding their own boundaries, which is reasonable.\n\nBut some might argue that the author was too strict, especially since Jim didn't bring it in, just kept it with him. However, the author's rule was clear, and the presence of a gun, even if not in the room, might be a deal-breaker. The author's right to their own space takes precedence here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be No, the author isn't in the wrong. They enforced their rule in their home, and it's their right to do so. The split reactions in the group don't change that. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
