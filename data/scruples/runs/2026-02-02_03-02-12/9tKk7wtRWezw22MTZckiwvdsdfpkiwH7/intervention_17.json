We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their board game group because he had a concealed gun. The scenario is that the author made it clear they didn't want any guns in their house, the guy had a concealed carry permit and brought his gun despite being told not to, and then the author banned him. The group is split on whether it was fair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. Since the author is hosting the event at their home, they have the right to set their own rules. Legally, in the U.S., homeowners can prohibit guns in their private residences, even if someone has a concealed carry permit. So the author is within their rights to make that rule. Socially, if someone is uncomfortable with guns, that's a valid personal preference. The author was upfront about the rule, and Jim either didn't comply or wasn't clear on it. The author followed through when the rule was broken, which seems reasonable.\n\nJim's actions: He was told to leave the gun in his truck. If he brought it into the house despite being asked, that's a violation of the host's rules. The author's response was to kick him out, which is a personal choice but not necessarily wrong. The other group members' mixed reactions are common in AITA posts, but the key is the host's right to set boundaries.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say that Jim was just following the law (if he's allowed to carry in public places) and the author was overreacting. But the host's house is private property, so the law might not require the host to allow the gun. Also, the author's stance is about personal safety and comfort, which is a valid reason.\n\nThe author's communication: They told Jim privately about the rule first, which is good. When the other member reported Jim having the gun, the author addressed it directly. The fact that Jim responded with \"Fine\" suggests he accepted the decision, so the author isn't being unreasonable here.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they set clear rules for their home and enforced them. The issue is a personal boundary, not a legal or safety violation (assuming local laws allow the host to ban guns). So the answer should be B.\n"
