He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not letting their friend stay over after his wife died. The situation is pretty intense. Jake's wife died, he's really struggling, and he ended up at the author's house. The author let Jake's daughter stay but not Jake himself. Then Jake went to sleep on the streets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Grief can make people do irrational things. Jake was in a lot of pain, using sleeping pills, and avoiding his house. The author's reasoning was to help Jake get over his grief by not letting him avoid his problems. But the result was that Jake ended up homeless for the night, which is really bad.\n\nThe author's intention was good, to help Jake face his emotions. But maybe they didn't think about the immediate consequences. Jake was in a vulnerable state. Even if the author thought they were helping, leaving him without a safe place could be seen as neglecting his immediate needs. The friend's daughter was with him, and the author allowed the child to stay but not the father. That might have separated the child from her parent, which adds another layer of wrongness.\n\nThe wife called the author an asshole, which suggests that the action was harsh. While the author's intention was to help, the action might have been too harsh. People in deep grief might need support rather than being pushed to face their pain alone. The author could have found a better solution, like getting professional help or offering a temporary stay while encouraging him to seek support. \n\nAlso, the fact that Jake ended up on the streets is a critical point. Even if the author didn't mean for that to happen, allowing him to leave without alternative housing might be seen as irresponsible. There's a balance between helping someone become independent and ensuring their safety. In this case, the author's action might have crossed into negligence because they didn't provide a safe alternative for Jake and his daughter. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because their approach led to a harmful outcome despite good intentions. They should have considered more compassionate solutions that kept Jake and his daughter safe while addressing his emotional state.\n"
