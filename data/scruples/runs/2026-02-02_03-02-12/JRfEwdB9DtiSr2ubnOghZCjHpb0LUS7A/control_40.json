He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a best friend, Jake, whose wife died. He's really struggling, and the author (the OP) turned him away from staying over, leading to Jake sleeping on the streets.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The OP's reasoning is that they wanted to help Jake get over his wife's death by not letting him avoid his house. They allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. The OP's wife was upset, calling them a massive asshole. The key points here are the author's intent versus the outcome.\n\nOn one hand, the author might have thought that by not letting Jake stay, they were pushing him to face his grief and not escape from his environment. They might believe that allowing him to stay would make him avoid dealing with his emotions. But on the other hand, Jake was in a severe emotional state, possibly in crisis, and the author's refusal led to him sleeping on the streets with his daughter already asleep. That seems dangerous and neglectful, even if unintentional.\n\nThe question is whether the author's actions were justified. The author did allow the daughter to stay, which is commendable, but turning Jake away without a plan might have been unwise. Jake was in a vulnerable state, with suicidal tendencies (taking sleeping pills), and the author's action could have contributed to his decision to sleep outside. Even if the intent was good, the outcome was harmful. The author might not have considered other options, like finding another place for Jake to stay or offering emotional support.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author might be seen as not fully supporting a grieving friend, even if the intention was to help. The line between helping someone face their problems and abandoning them can be thin. The author's action led to a negative consequence, so they might be in the wrong despite the good intentions. The friend's daughter's safety is also a factor here, as Jake was asleep and the daughter was left alone, which could be a risk.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because their action, while perhaps well-intentioned, resulted in harm and didn't account for the immediate needs and safety of Jake and his daughter. The author could have offered a different kind of help, like connecting him with a support group or a shelter, instead of just denying him shelter. They had the ability to provide support but chose not to, leading to a dangerous situation.\n"
