He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend whose wife died, and the author didn't let him crash at their house.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The friend Jake's wife died recently. He's struggling, using drugs, and the author was trying to help. When Jake showed up at the door, the author allowed his daughter to stay but not him. Then Jake ended up sleeping on the streets, leading to the wife being upset and the author questioning their decision.\n\nSo, the key points here are about supporting a grieving friend versus setting boundaries. The author's intention was to push Jake to cope, but the result was Jake being homeless for a night. The question is whether the author's action was wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the author's intention was to help by encouraging independence. But on the other hand, refusing to let a friend and his child stay when they're in crisis might be seen as not being supportive enough. Also, the fact that Jake ended up on the streets could indicate the author's approach had unintended negative consequences.\n\nMoral considerations: Balancing empathy with responsibility. The author might feel they were helping by pushing Jake to move on, but maybe they should have considered alternative solutions, like allowing him to stay for a short period under supervision or connecting him with other resources. The author's wife is upset because it seems harsh, but the author might feel they're doing the right thing long-term.\n\nLegal aspects? Probably not relevant here, but the emotional aspect is. Did the author have the right to refuse Jake? Yes, they can set boundaries, but maybe the way they did it wasn't compassionate enough. The alternative is that the author was trying to help in their own way, even if it backfired.\n\nPossible perspectives: Some might say the author is in the wrong for not being there for a friend in need. Others might say they are not in the wrong because they were trying to encourage resilience. The answer depends on societal values towards grief and support.\n\nI think the answer is a mix. The author's intention was to help, but the method might have been flawed. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the action led to a negative outcome, but the intent was good, does that absolve them? It's tricky. In many AITA scenarios, intentions matter, but consequences also do. If the author could have found a middle ground, like allowing Jake to stay but with conditions, that might have been better. But since they didn't, the result was harmful. So maybe the answer is A (in the wrong), because not allowing a grieving friend and his child to have shelter could be seen as neglecting their immediate needs, even if the intent was to help in the long term.\n"
