He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their best friend, Jake, stay over after his wife's death. So first, I need to understand the situation fully.\n\nJake's wife died recently. He's really struggling, dealing with depression, drinking, sleeping a lot. He told the author he was taking sleeping pills. Then, one night he shows up at the author's door with his daughter, asking to stay. The author lets the kid stay but refuses Jake, telling him he needs to get over it. Jake leaves, later goes back to his house, puts the kid to sleep, and then sleeps outside. The author's wife calls them an asshole, but the author thinks they're not in the wrong because their intention was to help Jake move past his grief.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The key points here are Jake's mental state, the presence of his young daughter, and the author's refusal.\n\nFirst, Jake is in a severe emotional crisis. He's dealing with the loss of a spouse and the responsibilities of a young child. His actions (taking sleeping pills, drinking) indicate he's at risk of self-harm or poor decision-making. The author's refusal to allow him to stay might have pushed him into a situation where he ends up on the street, which could be dangerous, especially given his mental state and the presence of his daughter. But the author allowed the child to stay, which is a good point.\n\nHowever, the author's reasoning was to help Jake get over his grief. But in reality, forcing someone in a vulnerable state to cope alone might not be helping. The author might not have realized that Jake's mental health crisis required immediate support rather than a push to be independent. Denying him shelter could exacerbate his depression and lead to worse outcomes. \n\nAlso, considering the child's safety: Jake put the child to sleep and then went outside. If the author had allowed Jake to stay, maybe the child would be safer. The author's decision might have indirectly affected the child's well-being, even though the child was allowed to stay separately. \n\nAnother angle: the author's wife is upset. Family support is crucial in such times, and the author's decision might have caused additional strain on their relationship. The author might not have considered the immediate emotional impact on Jake, leading to his hostile reaction and subsequent actions.\n\nBut then, the author might have had good intentions. However, intentions don't always align with the consequences. Even if the intention was to help, the action might have been harmful. The right approach might have been to allow Jake to stay temporarily, while also seeking professional help or community support for him. \n\nIn terms of social norms and empathy, friends in crisis often need immediate compassion and practical support, not the pressure to \"get over it\" during a vulnerable time. The author's refusal could be seen as lacking empathy, especially given Jake's fragile state. The fact that Jake ended up on the streets is a negative outcome, which could indicate that the author's decision had harmful effects.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong. The immediate need was to provide support and prevent further harm, rather than pushing Jake to cope alone. The author's approach might have been well-meaning but insufficient or inappropriate given the circumstances.\n"
