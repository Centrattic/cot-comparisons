He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for not letting their best friend, Jake, stay overnight after his wife died. Jake is clearly in a bad state\u2014depressed, using sleeping pills, and struggling to cope. He showed up at their door with his daughter, and the author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author's intention was to help Jake move past his grief, thinking he needs to face it. But Jake's reaction was a glare and leaving, leading him to sleep on the streets. The wife is upset, calling the author an asshole.\n\nJake's mental state is fragile. He's dealing with immense loss and might not be in a position to handle it alone. The author's approach might be well-meaning but could be too harsh. Allowing Jake to stay could provide him emotional support and a safe place, preventing him from harming himself. Even though the author didn't want Jake to avoid his grief, the immediate need is safety and support. \n\nThe author might have thought they were doing the right thing for long-term healing, but in a crisis, immediate care is crucial. Turning Jake away could have contributed to his decision to sleep outside, which is dangerous. The author's wife is right to feel upset because they didn't offer full support when needed. \n\nSo, the key points are: the author's intention vs. the action's consequences, the urgency of Jake's mental health crisis, and the responsibility of friends in such situations. The author might not be in the wrong if their intent was to help, but the outcome suggests the action was harmful. However, considering the circumstances, not offering shelter might be seen as neglecting immediate support needs. Therefore, the author could be considered in the wrong.\n"
