He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's best friend, Jake, lost his wife and is struggling a lot. He's been drinking and sleeping a lot, and now he showed up at the author's house at 1 AM with his daughter, asking to stay. The author said yes to the daughter but no to Jake, thinking he needs to cope. Then Jake ended up sleeping on the streets, and the author's wife is upset.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's intention was to help Jake get through his grief by not letting him avoid his situation. But Jake was at a breaking point. When someone is in severe emotional distress, sometimes they need immediate support and practical help. The author might have thought that by not letting Jake stay, he's pushing him to face reality, but maybe that's not the best approach when someone is in crisis.\n\nAlso, Jake's daughter was with him. The author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. That might have been a practical decision, but if Jake was in a state where he couldn't take care of himself, leaving him alone could be risky. He ended up going to the streets, which is dangerous, especially for someone taking sleeping pills. The author's wife is upset because she might see this as being uncaring towards a grieving friend.\n\nBut the author might believe that by not enabling Jake's avoidance, they're helping him in the long run. However, in a crisis, people might need immediate shelter and support, even if it's just a temporary fix. The author's action might have been based on good intentions but perhaps didn't consider the immediate safety and emotional needs of Jake.\n\nSo, the question is whether refusing to let Jake stay was wrong. On one hand, the author tried to be supportive but set a boundary. On the other hand, pushing someone in such a vulnerable state might not be helpful and could lead to harmful consequences. It's a balance between helping someone face their grief and providing necessary support during a crisis. Maybe the right approach would have been to allow Jake to stay temporarily while encouraging him to seek professional help or other support systems. The author's refusal might have been too abrupt without considering all the factors. So, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
