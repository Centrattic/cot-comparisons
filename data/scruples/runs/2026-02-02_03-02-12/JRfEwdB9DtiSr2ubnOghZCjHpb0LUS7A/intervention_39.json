He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves their best friend Jake, whose wife recently died. Jake is struggling with depression, using drugs, and the author decided not to let him stay over, which led to Jake sleeping on the streets.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning is that Jake needs to get over his wife's death. But is forcing someone to cope in the worst way possible actually helping? Jake was in a vulnerable state, and the author's response was to deny him shelter, even though he brought his daughter. The author allowed the kid to stay but not Jake, which seems contradictory. Jake then ended up on the streets, which is dangerous, especially with a child. The wife called the author an asshole, and the author's defense is that their intention was to help. But intentions don't always cover the consequences. \n\nThe key points here are: Jake is in crisis, the author's action may have contributed to a dangerous situation, and the author's approach might be seen as lacking empathy. While the author might not have intended harm, the outcome was negative. The community might consider the author responsible because they didn't provide support when it was needed. So, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
