He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's best friend, Jake, lost his wife and is struggling with depression. He showed up unannounced at the author's house with his daughter, asking to stay. The author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake, thinking it would help him cope. The friend then went to sleep on the streets, and the author's wife is upset, but the author feels they acted correctly.\n\nHmm. First, I need to understand the key points. The author is a friend who is trying to be supportive but also has their own boundaries. They allowed the daughter to stay, which is good, but refused Jake. Their reasoning was to help him not avoid his grief. But did that refusal lead to him sleeping on the streets? That's a big consequence. The author's intent was to help, but the outcome was negative. \n\nIs it right to deny a friend in such a crisis? On one hand, the author might be trying to encourage Jake to face his situation. But on the other hand, Jake was in a vulnerable state, actively using sleeping pills, and showing signs of potential self-harm or breakdown. By not allowing him to stay, maybe the author didn't consider the immediate risk. \n\nAlso, the situation was unannounced. The author might not be prepared to host someone at 1 AM, especially with a child. But they did accommodate the child, which shows they were willing to help. However, turning away a friend in such a state could be seen as not being there when he needed support the most. \n\nThe friend's wife is upset because of the outcome, but the author might not have realized the severity of Jake's mental state. It's possible the author underestimated the danger of Jake's actions. Even if the intention was good, the result was harmful. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because refusing help might have contributed to a dangerous outcome. However, if they had a valid reason (like not being able to host him, or trying to push him to face his grief), maybe they aren't. But in a crisis situation, maybe the immediate support is more important than the long-term goal. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't provide necessary support when it was most needed, leading to a potentially harmful situation. But I'm not 100% sure because the author's intention was to help. But the outcome matters too.\n"
