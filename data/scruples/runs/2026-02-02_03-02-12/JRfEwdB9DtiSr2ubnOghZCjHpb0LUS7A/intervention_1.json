He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend whose wife died, and he's struggling. The author of the post (AITA) turned down his friend's request to stay over, thinking it would help him move on. The friend then ended up sleeping on the street, and the author's wife is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend is in a lot of grief, dealing with depression, and using sleeping pills. The AITA person allowed the daughter to stay but not the friend. The reasoning was that the friend needed to get over his grief. But the friend ended up sleeping outside, which is dangerous, especially with a young child.\n\nThe question is whether the AITA person made the right decision. On one hand, they might be trying to help their friend face reality and avoid enabling dependency. On the other hand, turning down someone in such a vulnerable state without providing adequate support could be seen as uncaring. The friend ended up in a worse situation, which might indicate that the AITA person's action had unintended consequences.\n\nI should also think about the alternative actions. Was there a way to offer help beyond just their home? Maybe connecting the friend with professional help or other resources. Also, is it fair to deny someone a safe place to stay without ensuring they have another option? The author's wife called them a \"massive asshole,\" which suggests she felt they were wrong. But the author's intention was to help.\n\nIn such sensitive situations, empathy is crucial. Even if the intention is good, the outcome matters. The friend's well-being and the child's safety are important. Denying shelter might not be the best approach when someone is in crisis. There's a balance between helping someone become independent and ensuring they aren't harmed. The author might not have considered all the options, leading to a negative outcome. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't provide alternative support, leading to the friend sleeping on the street. Therefore, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong).\n"
