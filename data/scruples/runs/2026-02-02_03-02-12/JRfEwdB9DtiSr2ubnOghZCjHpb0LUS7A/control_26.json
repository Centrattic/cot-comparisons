He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay at their house after his wife died.\n\nFirst, the situation: Jake's wife died, he's really struggling, and he's been drinking a lot. He comes to the author's house in the middle of the night with his 3-year-old daughter, asking to stay. The author allows the daughter to stay but refuses Jake. Then Jake ends up sleeping on the streets. The author's reasoning is that they wanted to help Jake get over his grief, but their wife is upset with them for being an asshole.\n\nHmm. So, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. \n\nOn one hand, the author might have thought they were helping by not enabling Jake to avoid dealing with his grief by staying at his house. Maybe they thought forcing him to face his environment would help him heal. But on the other hand, Jake was in a vulnerable state. He's emotionally broken, and the author's refusal might have pushed him to a point where he decided to sleep outside, which is dangerous for both him and his daughter. The author allowed the child to stay but not Jake, which might imply they thought the child needed care but Jake didn't, but that's risky.\n\nJake's actions are concerning. Taking sleeping pills, being a mess, but the author's response could be seen as callous. Even if the intention was good, refusing help during a crisis when someone is in such a state could be harmful. There's also the aspect of the child being involved. If Jake is putting the child at risk by being out on the streets, the author's decision might have indirectly affected the child's safety.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that they were trying to push Jake to confront reality. But maybe a better approach would have been to offer support while still setting boundaries, like allowing Jake to stay but with some structure or getting professional help involved. The author didn't consider that Jake might not be in a state to make safe decisions on his own, leading to him choosing the streets.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author's wife is upset suggests that their approach was harsh. The author's reasoning might be well-intentioned, but the execution lacked empathy. In moments of extreme grief, people need support, not rejection. The author's refusal could have made Jake feel abandoned, which is counterproductive to healing.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's actions were harmful even if the intention was to help. They didn't provide a safe alternative, leading to a dangerous situation. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
