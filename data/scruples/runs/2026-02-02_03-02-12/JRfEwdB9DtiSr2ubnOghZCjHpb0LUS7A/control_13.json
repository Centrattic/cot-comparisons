He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not allowing their best friend Jake to stay at their house after his wife died. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, Jake is clearly in a very difficult situation. His wife died in a car crash, and he's struggling with depression, drinking, and sleeping. He has a young child, which adds to the complexity. The author and their wife tried to support him, but Jake's behavior is concerning.\n\nWhen Jake shows up at their door with his daughter in the middle of the night, the author allows the daughter to stay but refuses Jake. The reasoning is that Jake needs to \"get over it eventually.\" Jake reacts angrily and later goes to sleep on the streets after putting his daughter to sleep. The author's wife is upset with them for being an asshole, but the author thinks they're not in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Was the author wrong to deny Jake a place to stay? The author's intention was to help Jake move past his grief, but the outcome was that Jake ended up homeless for the night. \n\nOn one hand, the author might believe they were encouraging Jake to face his situation instead of avoiding it. However, considering Jake's mental state\u2014using sleeping pills, being depressed, and possibly suicidal\u2014their refusal could have contributed to a dangerous situation. Allowing Jake to stay might have provided immediate support and safety for both him and his daughter. \n\nThe author's decision might have been well-intentioned, but the result was harmful. Instead of pushing Jake to handle it alone, maybe they should have offered support while addressing his mental health. Refusing based on the idea that he needs to \"get over it\" might not be the best approach when someone is in crisis. \n\nAlso, the daughter's presence complicates things. The author allowed the child but not Jake, which could leave the child without a parent. That might not be in the child's best interest either. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might have a duty to ensure their friend's well-being, especially when there are signs of self-harm. The author's wife's reaction suggests that the decision was harsh. It's possible the author didn't consider that Jake might not have other options and that their refusal could lead to a harmful outcome.\n\nSo, while the author's intention was to help, the method might have been flawed. They could have offered support in a different way, perhaps connecting Jake with professional help or finding another arrangement. Refusing shelter might not be the right approach when someone is in such a vulnerable state.\n"
