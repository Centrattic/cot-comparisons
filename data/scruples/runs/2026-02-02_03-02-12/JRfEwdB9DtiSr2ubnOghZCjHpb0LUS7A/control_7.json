He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay at their house. The situation is that Jake's wife died, and he's really struggling. He came over unannounced at 1 AM with his daughter, and the author let the daughter stay but not Jake. Then Jake ended up sleeping on the streets, and the author's wife called them an asshole.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author did the right thing. On one hand, they wanted to help Jake get over his grief by not letting him avoid his house, which makes sense because avoiding triggers isn't a long-term solution. But on the other hand, Jake took it so far as to sleep on the streets, which could be dangerous, and the author didn't consider that their action might lead to that.\n\nI need to think about Jake's mental state. He's handling the death of his wife really badly, using sleeping pills, and is depressed. The author's intention was to help him move on, but maybe they didn't consider the immediate risk he might be in. Allowing him to stay might have been a temporary way to support him while he deals with his emotions. The author's wife is upset, but the author's reasoning is about helping him, not being cruel.\n\nHowever, the action of telling him he can't stay might have been too harsh given his fragile state. Even if the intention was good, the execution could be flawed. The best friend's daughter is present, and the author allowed her to stay, which shows they weren't entirely uncaring. But Jake's well-being is a concern too. Maybe the author should have offered a different solution, like staying for a few hours, or suggesting professional help rather than pushing him back into his environment. \n\nAlso, the fact that Jake took his daughter to sleep at the author's house but was turned away... the author allowed the daughter but not Jake. That might have been confusing or hurtful. The author could have considered that Jake might not be in a state to be alone, even if they didn't want him to stay permanently. Perhaps a compromise would have been better. \n\nIn the end, the author's intention was good, but the action might have been too abrupt without considering Jake's current mental health. The key is balancing support with encouraging independence. If Jake was a danger to himself or others, the author might have other responsibilities, like getting him professional help. But the story doesn't mention that. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but they could have handled it more carefully. However, since Jake ended up on the streets, which is risky, maybe the author should have allowed him to stay temporarily. The answer might depend on the interpretation of the situation and the responsibility to a friend in crisis.\n"
