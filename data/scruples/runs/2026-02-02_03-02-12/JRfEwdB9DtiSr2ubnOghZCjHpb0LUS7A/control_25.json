He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves their best friend, Jake, who's going through a tough time after his wife's death. The author allowed Jake's daughter to stay but not Jake himself. The wife called the author an asshole, but the author thinks they were trying to help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider Jake's mental state. He's dealing with severe grief, depression, and even using sleeping pills, which might be a cry for help. The author's decision to let the child stay but not Jake could be seen as not providing full support. But the author's reasoning is that Jake needs to face his grief and move on, which might be their perspective on helping.\n\nHowever, Jake ended up sleeping on the streets, which is a negative outcome. The author's action, while intended to push Jake to heal, might have been too abrupt. Maybe there's a middle ground, like setting boundaries while still offering support. Also, the fact that the author allowed the child but not the father could be seen as not considering Jake's immediate mental health needs. \n\nThe key points here are the intention to help versus the actual outcome. Even if the author thought they were helping, the result was Jake being homeless. Grief is complex, and pushing someone to 'get over it' might not be the best approach. The author might not have considered that Jake needed emotional support rather than being told what to do. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's actions led to a harmful consequence. Even if the intention was good, the execution might have been flawed. The friend was in a vulnerable state, and the author's refusal to let him stay could have worsened his situation. There might be a lack of empathy in the situation, focusing on the author's goal rather than Jake's immediate needs. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
