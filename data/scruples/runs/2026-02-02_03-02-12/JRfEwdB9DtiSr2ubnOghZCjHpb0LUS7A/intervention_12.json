He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing their best friend to stay over after the friend's wife died. The friend, Jake, was in a bad state, using pills, and then showed up at the author's house with his daughter at 1 AM. The author let the daughter stay but not Jake, leading to Jake sleeping on the street.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the situation. Jake is dealing with grief, and the author tried to help by allowing his daughter to stay. The author's reasoning was to push Jake to handle his grief, thinking it would help him recover. But Jake ended up sleeping on the streets, which seems bad. The wife called the author a massive asshole, but the author thinks they were right.\n\nSo, where's the line between helping and pushing someone to their breaking point? Allowing someone to stay temporarily might be a form of support. But the author didn't allow Jake to stay, maybe to encourage him to deal with the situation. However, sleeping on the streets is dangerous, especially for someone in such emotional distress. Did the author provide other options? Like contacting other friends, family, or maybe local shelters? The author might have thought Jake could handle it, but in reality, Jake might need more support. \n\nThe key points here are intent vs. outcome. The author intended to help by pushing Jake, but the outcome was harmful. Grief can make people act irrationally, and sometimes they need more immediate support rather than being told to \"get over it.\" Allowing the daughter to stay shows care, but excluding Jake might have been a mistake. Also, the situation escalated to Jake sleeping outside, which is concerning. The author might not be in the wrong, but perhaps there's a better way to handle it. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. \n\nI think it's a bit of both. The author's intention was good, but the action might have caused harm. Maybe they should have allowed Jake to stay temporarily and offered other resources. But since they didn't, and the result was negative, the author's approach might be seen as wrong. Alternatively, maybe the friend should have sought other help. But the author could be seen as not providing enough support. \n\nIn the end, the author's response, while possibly well-intentioned, may have been insufficient and contributed to a harmful outcome. So the answer might be that the author is in the wrong. But I'm a bit conflicted. The other perspective is that the author was trying to help Jake by not letting him avoid his grief. However, the immediate consequence was Jake being out on the streets. So, maybe the answer is A (wrong) because not allowing him to stay led to a bad outcome, and there might have been other ways to help. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the answer is B (not wrong) because the intent was to help him process grief. But the outcome is important here. I'm leaning towards A because the result was Jake being on the streets, which the author didn't intend but could have foreseen. So, they might be in the wrong for not considering the consequences.\n"
