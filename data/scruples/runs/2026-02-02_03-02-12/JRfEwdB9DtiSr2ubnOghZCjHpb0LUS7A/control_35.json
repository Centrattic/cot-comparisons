He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay overnight. So the situation is that Jake's wife died, he's really struggling, and he showed up unannounced with his kid. The author allowed the child to stay but not Jake, which led to Jake sleeping on the streets.\n\nFirst, consider Jake's mental state. He's in deep grief, using drugs and alcohol, and is emotionally unstable. He was told he had to get over it, but maybe the author didn't realize the severity of his condition. The author's intention was to help him cope, but setting a boundary by not letting him stay might have been too harsh without offering alternatives.\n\nThen there's the part about the wife calling the author an asshole. The author might not have considered that turning away a grieving friend could lead to dangerous outcomes. Jake's actions (taking sleeping pills) indicate he's at risk of self-harm or worse. The author's refusal might have pushed him to a point where he felt there was no safe place, leading to sleep on the streets, which is unsafe, especially with a young child.\n\nAlso, the author allowed the daughter to stay, which shows they care, but maybe they didn't address Jake's immediate needs. Perhaps they didn't have a plan for him beyond the initial refusal. The question is whether refusing him was the right approach. In a crisis, sometimes people need support, even if it means making exceptions. The author might have been trying to help by pushing him to face reality, but in doing so, they ignored his current inability to cope. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have the resources to host someone long-term and were trying to encourage independence. But Jake's situation is acute and requires immediate support. The key point is that Jake was in a fragile state and the refusal might have been a trigger without providing other options like contacting a helpline, a shelter, or other support services. The author might have been well-intentioned but failed to provide adequate support.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's action might have been too harsh without offering alternatives, leading to negative consequences. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
