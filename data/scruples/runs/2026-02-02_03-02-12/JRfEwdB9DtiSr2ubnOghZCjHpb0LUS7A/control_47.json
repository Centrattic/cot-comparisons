He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay at their house after his wife died. \n\nFirst, the friend is going through a really tough time\u2014his wife died, he's struggling with depression, and the situation is affecting his 3-year-old daughter. He showed up at the author's house in the middle of the night, and the author allowed the daughter to stay but not him. The reasoning was to help him get over his grief. But the friend ended up sleeping on the streets, and the author's wife is upset.\n\nSo, the author's intention was to push the friend to cope, but maybe they didn't consider the immediate risks. The friend was self-harming with pills and wasn't in a stable state. By not offering support, even if it was for a good reason, the author might have inadvertently put the friend in danger. Also, the daughter's well-being is a factor here. The author allowed the daughter to stay but not the father, which could have left the child without proper care. \n\nThe key points are: the friend was in a crisis, the author's approach was to push him to handle it, but the consequence was potentially worse. The author might have a valid point about wanting the friend to move forward, but in a situation involving mental health and a child, immediate support is crucial. The author could have found another way to help, like contacting other friends or professionals instead of turning them away. So, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong because their actions, even if well-intentioned, didn't account for the urgent needs and could have endangered both the friend and the child.\n"
