He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's best friend, Jake, lost his wife. He's really struggling, dealing with depression, and using drugs or alcohol. He showed up unannounced at the author's house with his daughter, asking to stay. The author let the daughter stay but refused Jake. The friend left, and later ended up sleeping outside. The author's wife is upset, but the author thinks he's right because he wanted to help Jake move on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the circumstances. Losing a spouse is a huge trauma. Jake is in a vulnerable state, and the author is trying to set boundaries. But on the other hand, Jake's daughter is involved, so the author's decision might affect her as well. The author allowed the child to stay but not the father. That seems a bit inconsistent. Maybe the author thought that by not letting Jake stay, he'd push him to take responsibility, but instead, Jake ended up on the streets, which is worse. \n\nThe key points here are the author's intention versus the outcome. The author's intention was to help Jake by not enabling his behavior, but the result was that Jake was left without a place to sleep. The author might have thought that allowing Jake to stay would make him rely on others instead of dealing with his grief. However, not providing a safe place for Jake when he's in crisis could be seen as neglecting a friend in need. Also, Jake's mental health is a concern; if he's in a state where he's considering overdosing, the author might be responsible for his well-being, especially if there's a relationship of trust.\n\nBut the author did let the daughter stay, which is a positive action. However, Jake's decision to sleep outside might be an overreaction. The author might argue that he can't be responsible for Jake's every move and that Jake needed to take care of himself. But given the situation, maybe the author could have found a middle ground, like allowing Jake to stay temporarily while encouraging him to seek help, rather than cutting him off completely. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the author's wife being upset. If the author's wife is part of the household, maybe they should have discussed the situation more before making a decision. The author might have acted impulsively in the moment. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the author knew Jake was in a fragile state and potentially suicidal (with the sleeping pills), refusing him shelter might cross a line. Even if the intention was good, the consequence was harmful. The author might be in the wrong for not considering the immediate safety and well-being of both Jake and his daughter. \n\nAlternatively, the author could be seen as setting a boundary, which is important in relationships. Overextending oneself can lead to burnout, so the author might have been trying to encourage independence. But Jake's situation seems extreme, and the author's action might not have been the best support given the circumstances.\n\nI think the answer depends on balancing the intention to help with the actual impact. Since Jake ended up worse off, the author might share some responsibility. So maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong), but I'm a bit torn because the intention was to help. Hmm.\n"
