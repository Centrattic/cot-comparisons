He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after refusing to let his best friend stay over when the friend's wife died. The friend, Jake, is clearly struggling with depression and possibly suicidal thoughts, using sleeping pills. He showed up unannounced with his 3-year-old daughter. The author allowed the kid to stay but not Jake, thinking he needs to overcome it. Later, Jake slept on the streets, and the author's wife is upset.\n\nHmm, the author's intention was to help Jake move past his grief, but the outcome was that Jake slept outside. That's a bad consequence. The author might not have considered that Jake's mental state is fragile, and forcing him to be alone could lead to self-harm. Even if the author thought he was helping, the action might have been harmful. Jake's daughter is there, so maybe the author should have found another way to support Jake. Also, the friend came to them in a crisis, and the author's response might have been too abrupt. Maybe the right approach was to offer support differently, like encouraging professional help rather than refusing shelter. The author's wife called him an asshole, which suggests others see it that way. So maybe the answer is A (in the wrong) because the author's action led to a dangerous situation for Jake. But the author's intention was good. However, in such situations, intentions don't matter if the action causes harm. So probably A.\n"
