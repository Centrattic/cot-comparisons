He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a best friend, Jake, whose wife died. He's really struggling, and after a month, he shows up at the author's house with his daughter at 1 AM, asking to stay. The author allows the daughter to stay but refuses Jake. The next day, Jake ends up sleeping on the streets, and the author's wife is upset. The author justifies this by saying they wanted to help Jake get over his grief.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Grief is a complex emotion. Jake is in a very vulnerable state, and his actions show he's not coping well. He's using sleeping pills, avoiding his house, and ends up on the streets. The author's intention was to push Jake to face his grief, but the timing and method might be questionable.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the author act appropriately in a crisis? Jake came to them in the middle of the night, clearly in distress. Refusing him shelter while allowing his daughter might have left him with nowhere to go. The author's wife called them an \"asshole,\" which suggests that their action was seen as harsh. But the author claims it was for Jake's own good, to help him move forward.\n\nHowever, in a mental health crisis, especially with someone who is depressed and possibly suicidal (he's taking sleeping pills), the immediate concern is safety. The author's refusal might have deprived Jake of support at a critical moment. Even if the intention was good, the outcome was harmful. The author might have a responsibility to ensure Jake's safety, not just push him to cope.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they can't take full responsibility for Jake's actions. But when someone is in such a vulnerable state and turns to a friend for help, the friend has a moral duty to provide some level of support, even if it's just listening or connecting them to resources. Sending him back to an environment that triggers him without support could be counterproductive.\n\nSo, balancing the intention and the outcome, the author's action might be seen as harsh and not considering Jake's immediate mental health needs. Even if the intention was to help, the approach was flawed. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
