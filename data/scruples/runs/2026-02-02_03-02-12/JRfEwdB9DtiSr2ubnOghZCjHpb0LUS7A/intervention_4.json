He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not letting their best friend, Jake, stay over after his wife died. \n\nFirst, the situation: Jake's wife died a month ago, he's really struggling, and he's become very depressed, drinking and sleeping a lot. His daughter is three years old. He went to the author's house in the middle of the night with his daughter, asking to stay because he can't handle his house. The author allowed the daughter to stay but refused Jake. Then Jake went back to his house, put the daughter to sleep, and slept on the streets. The author's wife was upset, but the author thought they were helping.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's look at the arguments for and against.\n\nOn the one hand, the author is trying to help Jake by pushing him to get over his grief. They might think that by not letting him stay, they're encouraging him to deal with his emotions rather than avoid them. Also, the author allowed the daughter to stay, showing they weren't entirely uncaring.\n\nOn the other hand, Jake was in crisis. He was suicidal, with a young daughter. The author had the means to offer him a safe place for the night, which could have prevented him from sleeping on the streets. The author's action might be seen as not providing necessary support during a time of extreme vulnerability. Even if the intention was to help, the outcome was that Jake ended up in a worse situation.\n\nBut the author's intention was to help Jake get through his grief. However, the way they handled it could be seen as not compassionate enough. People in deep grief might need immediate support rather than being told to \"get over it.\" The author might not have considered the potential consequences of refusing Jake, like his possible self-harm or putting his daughter in danger.\n\nAlso, the fact that Jake was considering taking sleeping pills shows a risk of suicide. The author might have a responsibility to ensure his safety, given that he's a friend and a father. Refusing to let him stay without ensuring alternative help (like contacting a crisis center or a family member) could be seen as neglecting that responsibility.\n\nBut the author did allow the daughter to stay, which is a positive action. They might have thought that by not taking in both, they were pushing Jake to take responsibility. However, Jake's actions afterward suggest that he wasn't in a state to make good decisions. The author's refusal might have forced him into a situation where he made a harmful choice.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, the question is about intent versus impact. The author's intent was to help, but the impact was hurting their friend. However, the line between helping and harming can be blurry in such situations. The community might weigh in on whether the author should have been more supportive regardless of the approach.\n\nI think the key points are Jake's mental state, the risk of self-harm, and the availability of a safe alternative. The author had the opportunity to provide immediate support but chose not to, leading to negative consequences. Even with good intentions, the refusal might be seen as not providing necessary care. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A), but there's a counterargument that they were trying to help. However, given the severity of Jake's situation, the author's actions could be considered insufficient, making them at least partially at fault.\n"
