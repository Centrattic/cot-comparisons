He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not letting his best friend Jake crash at his house. The situation is that Jake's wife died, he's struggling, and he showed up unannounced with his daughter. The author let the daughter stay but not Jake, leading to Jake sleeping on the streets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Grief is a serious issue, and Jake is in a vulnerable state. The author's intention was to help Jake move past his grief by not enabling him to avoid his home. But the outcome was Jake ending up on the streets, which is bad. The author's wife is upset, calling him an asshole. The user thinks the author is not wrong.\n\nBut wait, is forcing someone to stay in a harmful environment really helping? The author might believe that by not letting Jake stay, he's pushing Jake to face reality. However, Jake was in a crisis, and the author had the means to help but chose not to. The author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake, which might be seen as discriminatory or not considering Jake's mental state.\n\nAlso, Jake's actions\u2014taking sleeping pills, being in a depressed state\u2014are red flags. The author had a chance to intervene but didn't. Even if the intention was to help, the result was harmful. There might be a responsibility here as a friend to ensure Jake's safety, not just his own comfort. The author's decision, while well-meaning, led to negative consequences. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider the immediate danger Jake was in and failed to provide necessary support, even if it's not their fault entirely. But in AITA scenarios, intentions vs. outcomes matter. The answer could be A (yes, wrong) because the author's action led to Jake being homeless and potentially in danger, despite intentions.\n"
