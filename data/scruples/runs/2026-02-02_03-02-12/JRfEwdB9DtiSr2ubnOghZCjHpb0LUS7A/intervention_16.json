He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong for not allowing his best friend Jake to stay overnight at his house after Jake's wife died. \n\nFirst, the situation: Jake is dealing with severe grief, depression, and is using drugs to cope. He came to the author's house in the middle of the night with his daughter, asking for a place to stay. The author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake, advising him to get over his grief. Jake then went back home, put the kid to sleep, and slept on the streets. The author's wife is upset, but the author thinks he's not in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering the factors here. On one hand, Jake is in a vulnerable state, and the author might have a responsibility as a friend to offer support. Allowing Jake to stay could provide safety and stability, especially since he's risking his and his daughter's well-being. On the other hand, the author's intention was to help Jake become independent again, not enable bad habits. However, sending him out to sleep on the streets seems like a dangerous outcome, which the author might not have foreseen.\n\nThe key points are: Is the author responsible for ensuring Jake's safety even if it's not his primary goal? Did the author provide adequate alternatives or support? The author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. Was that a reasonable decision? Maybe the author should have considered other options, like staying with the daughter or contacting other resources. \n\nBut Jake was already in a bad state, and the author's decision might have been based on good intentions. However, the result was Jake being out on the streets, which is a negative consequence. The question is whether the author's action (denying Jake) was wrong despite the intentions. \n\nIn some perspectives, even with good intentions, the outcome matters. If Jake is in a mental health crisis, friends might need to step up and ensure he doesn't harm himself. The author might not have been in the wrong in the decision but perhaps in not considering alternative ways to help. However, the options available might be limited, especially in the middle of the night. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author wasn't in the wrong because they couldn't have known Jake would end up on the streets. But if they had a close relationship and knew his state, maybe they should have anticipated the risk. \n\nI think the answer might swing towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because they had the intention to help Jake recover, but there's a possibility of them being in the wrong (A) because they didn't provide alternative support. But given the information, the author's decision was based on their understanding at the time, even if it had unintended consequences.\n"
