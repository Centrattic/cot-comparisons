He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their best friend, Jake, crash at their house after Jake's wife died. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Jake is dealing with the loss of his wife, which is a huge trauma. He's struggling, becoming depressed, drinking, and maybe using sleeping pills. The author and their wife were woken up at 1 AM by Jake and his daughter. The author told Jake he couldn't stay because he needs to get over it, but allowed his daughter to stay. Then Jake went to sleep on the streets, which the author's wife found out and called the author an asshole.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning is that they wanted to help Jake get over his grief by not letting him stay. But Jake's reaction was to leave his daughter sleeping and go to the streets. The author's wife thinks they are wrong, but the author doesn't.\n\nHmm. Let me think about this. When someone is in deep grief, especially after a traumatic loss like a spouse, they might need more support and understanding. The author's approach might have been well-intentioned, but maybe not the right way to handle it. Forcing someone to face their grief immediately might not be helpful if they're not ready. Also, Jake was at a breaking point, leading him to sleep on the streets, which is dangerous, especially for a 3-year-old girl left alone.\n\nBut the author did allow the daughter to stay. So maybe they were trying to help the child but not the father. But if Jake was so distressed that he was considering pills and couldn't cope, not offering him a place to stay might have been a mistake. Maybe the author should have offered a safe place for both Jake and his daughter, maybe with the condition that they seek help, rather than just turning him away. \n\nAlso, the approach of \"get over it eventually\" might be too abrupt. People in grief need different things. Some might need time, space, and support. The author's response could have been unhelpful and maybe even contributed to Jake's decision to sleep on the street. The fact that Jake's daughter is 3 years old and left alone is concerning. The author might have thought they were helping by letting the kid stay, but the father's well-being is also important. If Jake is in such a state, maybe he needs professional help, but the author could have connected him to resources instead of just saying no.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's intention was to help, but the method might have been wrong. Grief is complex, and turning away a friend in such a vulnerable state could be seen as inconsiderate or not supportive. The author might not be in the wrong if they had a valid reason, but given the outcome (Jake sleeping on the streets), it seems like their approach had negative consequences. Therefore, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't provide adequate support when it was needed.\n"
