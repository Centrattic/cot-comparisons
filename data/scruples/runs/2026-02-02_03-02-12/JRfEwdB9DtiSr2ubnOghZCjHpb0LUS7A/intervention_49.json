He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a best friend, Jake, whose wife died. He's struggling, and after a breakdown, he shows up at the author's house with his daughter, asking for a place to stay. The author lets the daughter stay but not Jake. Jake then goes to sleep on the street. The author's wife is upset, but the author thinks they're not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Jake is dealing with a recent loss, which is a huge trauma. He's depressed, possibly using sleeping pills, and not handling things well. The author's decision was to allow the daughter but not Jake. The author's intention was to push Jake to cope, but the outcome was Jake sleeping on the streets, which is dangerous, especially for a man in his condition and with a young daughter.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that Jake needs to get over his grief. However, grief is a personal process, and pushing someone too hard can be harmful. Also, leaving a man in his mental state on the streets could be dangerous. The author didn't consider the immediate consequences\u2014like Jake putting himself or his daughter at risk\u2014and didn't offer an alternative solution, like connecting him with professional help or other support systems. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author did allow the daughter to stay, which shows some level of compassion. However, not providing a safe place for Jake might be seen as neglecting his immediate needs. Even though the intention was to help him cope, the method was flawed. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of intent, but the action's consequences could be considered harmful. \n\nAnother angle: the author could have said no, but in a way that still offered support. Maybe suggesting a different shelter, a friend's place, or professional help. By outright refusing without alternatives, the author might have inadvertently caused harm. So, whether it's right or wrong depends on whether the refusal was compassionate and helpful or just cold.\n\nIn the end, the key points are: the author's action led to Jake sleeping on the street, which is a serious risk. The author's intention was good but the execution wasn't supportive enough. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because they didn't provide a safer alternative, even if the intention was to push Jake to cope.\n"
