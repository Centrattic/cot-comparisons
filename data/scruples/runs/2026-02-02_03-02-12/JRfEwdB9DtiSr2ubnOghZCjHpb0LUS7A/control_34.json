He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay over after his wife died. The situation is pretty heavy. The friend, Jake, is really struggling with grief, leading to depression and possibly suicide attempts.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional state of Jake. He's in a lot of pain, and his actions, like taking sleeping pills, are concerning. The author allowed his daughter to stay but not him. The user's reasoning was to help Jake get over his grief, but the outcome was that Jake ended up on the streets. The wife is upset, thinking the author was harsh. \n\nOn one hand, the author might have thought setting boundaries was necessary to prevent enabling Jake's avoidance. But on the other hand, Jake's mental health is critical here. Denying him shelter could have led to dangerous situations, like sleeping on the streets, which is risky, especially with a child. The author might not have considered all the consequences or offered alternative support. \n\nThe key points are: Jake is in crisis, the author's intention was to help, but the action might have been too abrupt. There's a balance between supporting someone through grief and encouraging independence. However, when someone is suicidal or in extreme emotional pain, they might need immediate support rather than being pushed to cope right away. The author might have failed to provide the necessary support during a vulnerable time, even if the intention was good. \n\nSo, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider the immediate dangers and emotional needs of their friend, leading to harmful consequences. They could have offered temporary accommodation while encouraging him to seek professional help or connected him with resources. Instead, cutting him off without alternatives may have been harmful.\n"
