He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a best friend, Jake, whose wife died. He's struggling, and the author didn't let him stay overnight. Jake came to their house with his daughter, and the author allowed the daughter to stay but not him. Then Jake went to sleep on the streets, and the author's wife is upset with them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author's intention was to help Jake get over his wife's death by not giving him an easy way out. But Jake was in a vulnerable state, dealing with grief, depression, and maybe even thoughts of self-harm. The author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. That seems harsh because Jake might have been in a crisis. \n\nThe author argues that they didn't want to enable Jake's avoidance of his grief. However, when someone is in a severe mental health crisis, especially after a traumatic event like the death of a spouse, the priority is safety. If Jake was considering taking sleeping pills to the point of possibly overdosing, that's a medical emergency. The author's refusal to let him stay could have contributed to a dangerous situation. \n\nAlso, Jake has a child to care for. Even if the author didn't let him stay, maybe there's a better way to handle it, like contacting another friend, family member, or even a professional. The author's wife called them a massive asshole, which suggests that the action was seen as inconsiderate. The author might not have thought through the immediate consequences of their decision. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that pushing Jake to face his grief was necessary. But in a situation where someone is actively trying to harm themselves, the immediate priority should be ensuring their safety. The author might have been trying to be helpful in the long run but didn't address the immediate crisis. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's action might be seen as contributing to a dangerous situation. They didn't provide the necessary support during a critical time. Even if their intention was good, the outcome could have been worse. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
