He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay overnight after his wife died. So the situation is that Jake's wife died, he's really struggling, and he showed up unannounced at the author's house with his daughter. The author allowed the kid to stay but not Jake, reasoning that Jake needed to get over it. Then Jake ended up sleeping on the streets, and the author's wife is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional state of Jake. He's grieving, which is a very intense and personal experience. The author's intention was to help Jake move past his grief, but the action of refusing him shelter might have unintended consequences. Even if the author thought it was for Jake's good, the immediate need during a crisis is safety and support. \n\nJake was in a vulnerable state, using sleeping pills, which is concerning. By not letting him stay, the author might have pushed him into a worse situation. Even though the author allowed the daughter to stay, Jake's decision to sleep on the streets after that refusal could indicate that he felt rejected or unsupported when he needed it most. \n\nGrief can affect people differently. Some might need more time and support to process it. The author's approach might be seen as dismissive of Jake's current emotional state. The key here is whether the author's actions, while intending to help, actually caused harm. The fact that Jake ended up on the streets suggests that the author's refusal might have been a contributing factor to his current crisis.\n\nAlso, the author's wife called them an asshole, implying that the author's reaction was harsh. The author's justification is that they wanted Jake to \"get over it,\" but that's a very short-term perspective. In such a situation, empathy and immediate support are usually more critical than long-term solutions. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't provide necessary support during a time of crisis, which led to Jake's harmful actions. Even if the intention was good, the outcome was negative. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
