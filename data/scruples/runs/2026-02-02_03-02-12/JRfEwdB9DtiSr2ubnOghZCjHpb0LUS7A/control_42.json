He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the user's best friend, Jake, lost his wife and is struggling. He came to the user's house asking to stay because he couldn't handle being at his own. The user allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. Jake then ended up sleeping on the streets, and the user's wife is upset with them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Grief can make people act unpredictably, and Jake is in a very vulnerable state. The user's intention was to help him get over his grief by not letting him avoid his home. But by refusing Jake, even though he's in crisis, maybe the user's approach was not the best. \n\nOn one hand, the user is trying to be supportive by encouraging Jake to face his reality, which might be a good long-term strategy. But on the other hand, Jake was in immediate distress, using sleeping pills, and had a young child. The user allowed the child to stay, which is responsible, but not allowing the father to have any support might have led to a worse outcome. \n\nIs it the user's responsibility to ensure Jake's safety? They might have thought they were helping, but by not allowing him to stay, they might have inadvertently contributed to him choosing to sleep on the streets, which is dangerous. The user's wife is upset, suggesting that maybe the approach was too harsh. \n\nAlso, considering that Jake was at their door in the middle of the night, showing up in a state of crisis, turning him away could be seen as not being there for a close friend when he needed help. Even if the intention was good, the result was harmful. The user might not have considered alternative solutions, like helping him stay at a hotel or calling a professional. \n\nSo while the user might have had good intentions, the outcome was negative, and they might be in the wrong for not providing the immediate support that was needed. The answer might be A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
