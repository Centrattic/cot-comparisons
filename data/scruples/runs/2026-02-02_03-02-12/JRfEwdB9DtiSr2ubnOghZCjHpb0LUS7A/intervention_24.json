He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay over after his wife died. The situation is pretty intense. The friend, Jake, is really struggling, and he showed up unannounced with his daughter. The author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. Then Jake ended up sleeping on the streets, which the wife found out and called the author an asshole. The author says their intention was to help him move past the grief.\n\nHmm, so first, the emotional aspect. Grief is a heavy situation. Jake is in a lot of pain, and the friend's reaction might be seen as not supporting him enough. The author's reasoning is that Jake needs to get over it, but in reality, grief isn't something you just get over quickly. It's a process. The author didn't kick him out intentionally, but by not letting him stay, maybe they didn't consider the immediate emotional needs. Also, Jake's daughter is involved, which complicates things. The author allowed the daughter but not the father, which might have been a way to help without fully supporting Jake. But Jake's decision to sleep on the streets after that could have been preventable if there was more support. However, the author's wife is upset, and they might have had legitimate reasons for the decision, like space or their own well-being. But the key point is whether the author's action was wrong. \n\nIn terms of moral judgment, sometimes even with good intentions, actions can be hurtful. The author might not be in the wrong in their own mind, but others might see it as a failure to support a grieving friend. The fact that Jake ended up on the streets suggests that the author's approach didn't account for the immediate crisis. The question is whether refusing to let Jake stay, despite the intention to help him move past grief, was wrong. \n\nI think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. Even if the intention was good, the result was that instead of helping Jake through his grief, the friend pushed him away, leading to a worse situation. The author should have considered alternative solutions, like letting him stay but setting boundaries, or connecting him with other support systems rather than turning him away. The emotional needs of someone in deep grief require more empathy and practical help, not just a philosophical approach of \"getting over it.\" So the answer is A.\n"
