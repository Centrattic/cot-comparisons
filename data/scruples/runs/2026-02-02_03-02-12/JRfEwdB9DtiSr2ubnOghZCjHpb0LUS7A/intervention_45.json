He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay overnight after his wife died. The situation is complicated because Jake is clearly struggling, and the author's actions led to Jake sleeping on the streets.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to help Jake get through his grief by not enabling him to avoid his house. But Jake ended up in a worse situation. The author allowed Jake's daughter to stay but not Jake himself. That might have been a way to help the child without enabling Jake's avoidance, but it could come off as callous.\n\nJake was in a fragile state, taking sleeping pills and emotionally overwhelmed. The author's refusal might have been seen as not supporting a close friend during a crisis. Even though the intention was good, the outcome was harmful. The wife's reaction as a \"massive asshole\" suggests that the action was perceived as harsh.\n\nBut the author did let the daughter stay, which shows some compassion. The problem is that Jake was left without a place, leading him to the streets. The author might have thought they were helping, but maybe not considering the immediate consequences. There's a balance between helping someone through grief and not enabling destructive behavior, but in this case, the method might have been too abrupt.\n\nThe key points are the friendship, the mental state of Jake, and the unintended consequences. While the author had good intentions, the outcome was negative. Maybe there's a middle ground, like setting up a temporary arrangement with conditions or involving other support systems. Since the author's action directly led to Jake sleeping outside, that's a problem. So, the answer might lean towards A (in the wrong) because the refusal had severe consequences despite good intentions.\n"
