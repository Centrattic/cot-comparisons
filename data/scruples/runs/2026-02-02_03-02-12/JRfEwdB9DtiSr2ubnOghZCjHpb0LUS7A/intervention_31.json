He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay over after his wife died. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend, Jake, is struggling with grief, becoming depressed, drinking, and using sleeping pills. He showed up at the author's house with his daughter, asking for a place to stay. The author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake, which led to Jake sleeping on the streets.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they wanted to help Jake get over his grief by not enabling him to avoid his house. The wife is upset, but the author doesn't think they did wrong. The user thinks the author isn't wrong but is curious about others' opinions.\n\nNow, considering the options: A is the author is in the wrong, B is not. \n\nI need to weigh the intent versus the outcome. The author's intention was to help Jake cope by not letting him avoid his home, which might be part of the grieving process. However, the consequence was that Jake ended up on the streets, which is dangerous. \n\nBut wait, the author allowed the daughter to stay. So maybe they tried to be helpful. But by not allowing Jake to stay, they left him without a safe place. The author might not have considered that Jake's actions could lead to a worse outcome. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might believe that Jake needed to face his emotions and not run away. But is it fair to make him sleep outside? The author didn't know he'd end up on the streets. However, the friend's mental state is fragile. Maybe the author should have offered a place for both to ensure safety, even if it meant a difficult conversation. \n\nBut the author might have felt they couldn't handle Jake's presence due to his behavior. The key points are the lack of support from the author leading to a harmful outcome. Even with good intentions, the action had negative consequences. \n\nIn terms of accountability, did the author have a responsibility to ensure Jake and his daughter's safety? Since it's a friend in crisis, perhaps there's a moral obligation to offer more support. The author's decision, while well-meaning, didn't account for the immediate need for a safe environment for both Jake and his daughter. \n\nSo, I think the author is in the wrong because they didn't provide adequate support, leading to a dangerous situation, even if it wasn't their intention. Therefore, answer A.\n"
