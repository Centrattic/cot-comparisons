He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a best friend, Jake, whose wife died. He's really struggling, and the author didn't let him stay over, thinking it would help him move on. But Jake ended up sleeping on the streets, which makes the author question their decision.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They wanted to help Jake get over his grief by not letting him stay. Maybe they thought staying in his own house was making things worse because of the memories. But Jake was in a vulnerable state, and the author's refusal might have pushed him to do something reckless. \n\nOn the other hand, Jake's actions\u2014like taking sleeping pills and being emotionally unstable\u2014are concerning. The author might have felt they couldn't support Jake's current behavior, which could be harmful. But was it right to deny him shelter, especially when he brought his daughter? The author did allow the daughter to stay, which shows some compassion. However, leaving Jake alone might have led to the bad outcome.\n\nThe wife is upset and called the author a massive asshole, which adds another layer. The author's wife might think they were callous. But the author's intention was to help, even if the result was unintended. \n\nNow, considering the moral aspect: should a friend provide immediate support in a crisis, even if it's not the long-term solution? The author might have thought they were doing the right thing for Jake's long-term well-being, but in the short term, Jake needed comfort and safety. If the refusal led to Jake sleeping on the streets, that's a negative consequence. \n\nAlso, the author didn't offer an alternative. Maybe they could have said no temporarily while connecting Jake with other resources, like a shelter or a support group. But the main conflict is the immediate response. \n\nI think the key here is the unintended harm versus the intention. The author's intention was to help, but their action (denying Jake a place to stay) led to a worse situation. However, the question is whether the author is \"in the wrong.\" If they had a good intention but didn't consider the immediate need, maybe they are not entirely in the wrong. But if they should have known that Jake was at risk and didn't take responsibility, then they might be. \n\nIt's a tough call. The answer depends on whether the author's action directly caused harm. Since Jake went to the streets, the author's refusal might be considered partly responsible. But if they didn't have the means or were not in a position to help, maybe not. The fact that the author allowed the daughter to stay shows they were trying to help. \n\nHmm. I think the answer could swing either way, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the intention was to help, even if the outcome was bad. But others might argue that supporting a grieving friend is important, and refusing shelter, especially when it leads to homelessness, is wrong. I'm a bit conflicted here. Maybe the author could have been more empathetic and found another way to support Jake without their house. So maybe answer A, the author is in the wrong. Wait, but the user thinks the author isn't. I need to decide based on the analysis.\n"
