He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's best friend Jake, who's dealing with the death of his wife. Jake showed up at the author's house in the middle of the night with his daughter, asking to stay because he can't be in his own house. The author allowed the daughter to stay but refused Jake, thinking he needs to get over it. Then Jake ended up sleeping on the streets, and the author's wife is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's intention was to help Jake cope, but their method might have been flawed. Allowing the daughter to stay but not Jake could be seen as compassionate yet firm. However, refusing without offering alternatives might have led to a worse outcome. Jake's mental state is critical here\u2014he's suicidal, as he's taking sleeping pills, which is a red flag. The author didn't consider that Jake might not be in a position to handle being alone, especially with a child. \n\nThe author's decision to not let Jake in could be seen as not providing necessary support during a crisis. Even if the intention was good, the consequence was Jake sleeping on the streets. The author should have maybe called someone else for help or ensured Jake and the daughter were safe. On the other hand, the author might have felt they were encouraging independence, but in a severe mental health crisis, that's not appropriate. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's action, though well-intentioned, led to harm. Since Jake ended up in a dangerous situation, the author might share some responsibility for not ensuring his safety adequately. Therefore, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't handle the situation with enough care for Jake's mental health.\n"
