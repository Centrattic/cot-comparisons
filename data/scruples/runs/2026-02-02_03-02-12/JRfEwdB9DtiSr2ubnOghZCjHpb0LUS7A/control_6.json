He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay over after his wife died. The friend, Jake, is clearly in a bad state\u2014depressed, using sleeping pills, and not handling the loss well. He showed up at the author's house with his daughter, and the author allowed the kid to stay but not him. Jake then went to sleep on the streets.\n\nHmm, the author's reasoning is that Jake needs to get over his grief. But forcing someone who's in a vulnerable state to sleep outside seems harsh. Even if the intention was to help, the action might be harmful. Jake's mental state is unstable, and the author didn't consider the immediate consequences. The wife is upset, and the author's approach could be seen as neglecting a friend in crisis. But maybe there's a line between helping and enabling? \n\nWait, Jake has a 3-year-old daughter. If the author allowed the daughter to stay, maybe they considered her safety. But Jake's not neglecting the child, so maybe the author thought Jake could manage. However, making a grieving person sleep on the streets is risky. The author could have offered a compromise, like staying for a few hours but not the whole night, or connecting him with professional help. \n\nAlso, the friend's actions (drinking, sleeping pills) indicate possible self-harm tendencies. The author's refusal might have pushed Jake into a dangerous situation. Even if the intention was to help, the outcome could be seen as harmful. Friends in crisis need support, not rejection, even if it's for their own good. So, the author might be wrong in their approach. \n\nBut maybe the author felt they couldn't handle the situation long-term and wanted to encourage independence. Still, the immediate reaction of sending someone to the streets without alternatives is questionable. The answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because the action didn't consider the friend's mental health and immediate needs, leading to a worse outcome.\n"
