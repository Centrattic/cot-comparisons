He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves their best friend Jake, whose wife recently died. The author allowed Jake's daughter to stay but not Jake himself, thinking it would help him move on. But Jake ended up sleeping on the streets, and the author's wife is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Grief is complicated, and Jake is clearly struggling. The author's intention was to help Jake by not enabling his avoidance of his situation. However, the outcome was Jake taking his daughter outside, which might not have been the best result.\n\nIs the author wrong? Maybe not directly. They tried to support the child while pushing Jake to face his grief. But there's a nuance here. Maybe the author could have handled it differently, like offering a temporary space for both and seeking additional help. Jake's actions leading to sleeping on the streets might be a result of his mental state, not just the author's refusal. The author's wife is upset, so there's a personal dynamic here too.\n\nThe key points are intent vs. outcome. The author meant to help, but the result was negative. However, is it right to deny a friend who's in crisis? Maybe there's a middle ground. The author's decision might be seen as harsh, but not necessarily in the wrong. The answer could be B (not in the wrong), but with consideration for the consequences.\n"
