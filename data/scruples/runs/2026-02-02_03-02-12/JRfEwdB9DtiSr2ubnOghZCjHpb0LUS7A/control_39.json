He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay over after his wife died. The situation is complicated because Jake is clearly in a bad state, with depression, possible substance abuse, and he ended up sleeping on the streets after being turned away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional state of Jake. Losing a spouse is extremely traumatic, and his mental health is deteriorating. He's using sleeping pills, which is concerning. The author's decision might be based on the idea that Jake needs to face his grief, but that's a harsh approach. However, the author did allow the child to stay, which shows some level of responsibility towards the kid's well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, turning Jake away without a plan might have contributed to him sleeping on the street. Even if the intention was to push him to handle it, the outcome was harmful. The author didn't provide an alternative, like contacting other friends, family, or maybe a support group. The wife's reaction suggests that the author's approach was too abrupt and lacked empathy.\n\nThe key points are: Jake was in a crisis, the author allowed the child to stay but not Jake, and Jake ended up on the streets. The author's reasoning was to help him move past the grief, but the method was flawed. There's a balance between letting someone wallow and providing necessary support. The author didn't offer a middle ground, which might be where the fault lies.\n\nAlso, being a best friend, the expectation might be higher for support. The author's action, while perhaps well-intentioned, didn't provide the support Jake needed. The glare and leaving without saying anything show how hurt Jake felt. The author's wife calling them an asshole indicates that their approach was too harsh. \n\nIn conclusion, even if the intention was to help, the execution lacked compassion and practical alternatives. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't provide adequate support and their actions had negative consequences.\n"
