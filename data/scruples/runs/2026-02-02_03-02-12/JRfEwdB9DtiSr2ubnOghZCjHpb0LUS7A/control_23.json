He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong. The situation is about their best friend Jake whose wife died, and he's struggling a lot. The author refused to let Jake stay at their house, only allowing his daughter to stay. Then Jake ended up on the streets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Jake is dealing with a major loss and is clearly in a bad mental state. He's using sleeping pills, which might be a red flag for self-harm. The author's reasoning was to help Jake get over his grief by not letting him stay. However, the outcome was that Jake went to the streets, which is dangerous, especially for someone in a vulnerable state.\n\nThe author's wife called them a massive asshole, so there's conflict in the household. The user argues that their intention was to help, but the result was harmful. The key points here are the author's judgment of Jake's situation and their responsibility as a friend. \n\nOn one hand, the author might think they're pushing Jake to cope. On the other hand, denying him shelter when he's in crisis, especially with a child, could be seen as neglecting their duty as a friend. Jake might have been in a state where he needed immediate support rather than being told to \"get over it.\" Also, the author allowed the child to stay, which is good, but leaving Jake alone might have led to a dangerous situation.\n\nThe author's action might have been well-intentioned but perhaps not the best approach. Emotional support during grief isn't about forcing someone to be strong but providing a safe space. The author might not have considered Jake's mental state and potential for self-harm. So, the answer could be that the author is in the wrong because they didn't provide necessary support, leading to Jake sleeping on the streets when he needed help.\n"
