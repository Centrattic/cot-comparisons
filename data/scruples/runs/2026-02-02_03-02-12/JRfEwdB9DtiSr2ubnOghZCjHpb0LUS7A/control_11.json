He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves their best friend, Jake, who's dealing with the death of his wife and has been struggling. The author let Jake's daughter stay at their house but refused Jake himself, thinking it would help him cope. Then Jake ended up on the streets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Grief is a tough situation, and Jake is clearly in a vulnerable state. He's been drinking, having trouble sleeping, and even taking sleeping pills. The author's intention was to help him by not letting him avoid his trauma, but they might not have considered the immediate safety and well-being of Jake and his daughter. \n\nThe author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. That might have left Jake alone, which could be dangerous given his mental state. The author's wife is upset, and Jake ended up on the streets. Even if the intention was good, the outcome was harmful. Maybe the author should have found a middle ground, like allowing Jake to stay temporarily but encouraging him to seek help, rather than leaving him without support.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have realized the severity of Jake's situation. They might have thought that pushing him to face his environment would help, but in reality, it led to him being homeless. There's a balance between helping someone process grief and ensuring their immediate safety. The key here is that the author didn't provide an alternative for Jake, which could be seen as a failure in support.\n\nSo, considering that the author's action (refusing Jake) led to a negative outcome without providing another solution, they might be in the wrong. They should have perhaps set up a safer plan, like involving other friends, family, or professionals. The answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because their action didn't consider the immediate risks to Jake's well-being.\n"
